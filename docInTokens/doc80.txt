i
had
been
out
of
germany
for
thirty-five
years
drawn
hither
and
thither
by
various
glittering
of
will-of-the-wisps
when
i
returned
to
my
native
country
i
was
as
poor
in
pocket
as
when
i
left
and
much
poorer
in
illusions
the
berlin
insurance
company
which
i
had
represented
with
such
mediocre
success
in
switzerland
austria
and
belgium
agreed
to
let
me
sell
for
them
at
home
and
by
a
curious
coincidence
there
was
an
opening
in
the
quaint
old
bavarian
city
in
which
i
had
been
born
and
bred
i
will
pass
over
the
strangely
mingled
feelings
with
which
i
rode
in
a
twentieth
century
railroad
train
past
the
thousand-year-old
walls
of
one
of
the
most
curious
ancient
cities
in
europe
a
town
moreover
whose
every
winding
narrow
street
and
sharp-gabled
building
had
been
the
companion
of
my
infancy
and
childhood
no
one
seemed
to
know
me
and
i
recognized
no
one
for
several
days
i
made
no
attempt
to
sell
life
insurance
but
wandered
in
a
dream
the
bewildered
ghost
of
my
former
self
about
the
spots
which
i
had
known
in
happier
days
one
dull
rainy
afternoon
i
took
refuge
from
the
weather
in
a
dingy
little
coffee-house
in
which
at
the
age
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
i
along
with
certain
boon
companions
had
learned
the
gentle
art
of
billiards
it
seemed
as
if
every
article
of
furniture
was
just
as
i
had
walked
away
from
them
well
toward
half
a
century
before
it
was
raining
outside
and
i
sat
alone
in
the
gloomy
smoky
old
place
pondering
the
sweet
and
bitter
mysteries
of
life
while
i
sat
thus
staring
out
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
rain
which
was
by
this
time
beating
down
smartly
on
the
pavement
i
became
conscious
that
someone
in
the
room
was
staring
at
me
i
had
not
noticed
that
there
was
anyone
else
in
the
dark
low-ceilinged
place
except
the
obsequious
proprietor
who
had
served
me
my
cigar
and
coffee
now
i
realized
that
a
man
who
sat
in
the
corner
diagonally
across
from
me
was
studying
me
curiously
from
over
his
newspaper
his
face
was
one
that
i
had
seen
before
suddenly
across
all
the
years
i
remembered
him
and
in
that
same
moment
he
rose
and
came
toward
me
with
his
hand
held
out
we
had
been
in
school
together
in
the
gymnasium
he
had
been
a
strange
fellow
with
few
friends
but
had
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
the
best
student
in
his
class
but
in
his
last
year
in
the
gymnasium
he
had
for
what
reason
i
never
knew
excited
the
animosity
of
a
cantankerous
old
professor
who
had
publicly
declared
that
gustav
was
not
the
kind
of
boy
who
should
have
a
gymnasium
diploma
and
that
he
the
professor
was
determined
never
to
give
him
a
passing
grade
my
father
had
admired
the
boy
very
much
and
at
one
juncture
when
my
marks
looked
perilously
low
he
had
employed
gustav
to
tutor
me
gustav
had
been
so
successful
that
father
was
delighted
and
made
him
a
present
of
a
silver
cigarette
case
with
gustav's
initials
and
mine
engraved
on
it
i
remembered
all
this
very
distinctly
as
we
shook
hands
but
i
was
doing
fast
thinking
because
for
the
life
of
me
i
couldn't
remember
his
strange
last
name
i
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
a
very
foreign
name
polish
or
croatian
or
something
of
the
sort
as
he
mentioned
this
and
that
i
fear
i
answered
him
a
little
absently
and
incoherently
the
name
was
almost
there
the
syllables
flitted
tantalizingly
just
out
of
my
reach
but
i
was
sure
the
name
began
with
a
b
wasn't
it
a
bam-
or
a
ban-something
ah
i
had
it
banaotovich
from
that
moment
the
conversation
went
more
easily
i
was
surprized
and
pleased
when
banaotovich
drew
his
silver
cigarette-case
out
of
his
pocket
to
prove
to
me
how
highly
he
thought
of
my
poor
deceased
father
we
were
soon
launched
on
a
cordial
exchange
of
childhood
memories
banaotovich
seemed
a
good-hearted
fellow
after
all
and
i
wondered
why
in
my
childhood
i
had
never
been
quite
comfortable
in
his
company
i
remembered
that
other
boys
of
the
group
had
admitted
to
me
confidentially
that
they
were
more
than
a
little
afraid
of
him





the
longer
we
talked
the
more
intimate
the
more
in
the
nature
of
a
mutual
confession
our
conversation
became
i
admitted
to
banaotovich
that
the
hifalutin
fashion
in
which
i
had
left
the
town
to
win
fame
and
fortune
years
before
had
been
asinine
in
the
extreme
and
that
it
served
me
just
right
to
have
to
sneak
back
unknown
and
penniless
banaotovich
rejoined
that
for
all
his
pride
in
his
school
marks
he
had
remained
a
person
of
no
importance
and
that
the
pot
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
making
itself
ridiculous
by
calling
the
kettle
black
he
seemed
almost
painfully
inclined
to
run
himself
down
i
could
feel
in
his
manner
a
sort
of
pathetic
reaching
out
for
sympathy
and
consideration
and
it
began
to
seem
as
if
he
were
about
to
tell
me
something
or
ask
me
for
something
but
whatever
he
had
to
tell
seemed
hard
to
say
and
it
was
slow
in
coming
over
his
lips
banaotovich
ordered
two
bottles
of
the
heavy
native
wine
i
drank
sparingly
of
it
because
it
goes
to
my
head
but
banaotovich
swallowed
two
or
three
glassfuls
in
hasty
succession
and
his
cheeks
grew
flushed
there
was
a
pause
suddenly
he
leaned
across
the
table
toward
me
and
spoke
in
a
hoarse
excited
whisper
modersohn
he
said
anxiously
i
want
to
make
a
confession
to
you--a
terrible
confession
it
may
turn
you
against
me
completely
maybe
you
don't
want
to
hear
it
if
you
don't
say
so
and
i'll
go
home
but
it
seems
as
if
i've
got
to
tell
somebody
about
it
it
seems
as
if
i've
got
to
find
somebody
who
understands
me
and
can
excuse
me
or
it
will
kill
me
shall
i
tell
you
shall
i
i
was
startled
i
was
reasonably
sure
that
banaotovich
was
no
criminal
since
he
had
lived
half
a
century
in
his
native
city
undisturbed
and
from
all
he
had
told
me
solvent
and
respected
i
had
always
known
that
he
was
a
queer
fish
a
brooding
solitary
sort
of
person
and
i
settled
myself
to
listen
to
some
harmless
bit
of
psychopathy
which
meant
nothing
except
to
the
unfortunate
subject
my
dear
fellow
i
said
no
doubt
a
little
patronizingly
i
am
sure
you
haven't
anything
to
confess
that
will
make
you
out
an
outrageous
rascal
but
if
it
will
do
you
any
good
to
tell
me
your
troubles
i
am
ready
to
listen
to
them
thank
you
said
banaotovich
in
a
trembling
voice
i've
done
nothing
that
they
can
put
me
behind
the
bars
for
but
i--i----
he
stared
at
me
sternly
but
i've
done
worse
things
he
said
solemnly
than
some
poor
fellows
that
have
been
strung
up
by
the
neck
and
choked
to
death
i
laughed
a
little
nervously
tell
me
your
story
if
you
like
i
said
and
let
me
decide
just
how
black
you
are
but
i
haven't
a
great
deal
of
apprehension
we're
all
of
us
poor
miserable
sinners
as
far
as
that's
concerned
i
could
tell
you
things
about
myself----
banaotovich
was
not
listening
to
me
at
all
he
had
fallen
suddenly
into
a
fit
of
black
brooding
after
a
minute
or
two
he
looked
up
and
asked
sharply
do
you
remember
wolansky
wolansky
was
the
greek
professor
who
had
threatened
to
vote
against
banaotovich
when
he
was
finishing
his
course
at
the
gymnasium
of
course
said
i
and
i
remember
well
how
he
abused
you
that
last
year
if
there
ever
was
a
cantankerous
old
scoundrel
wolansky
was
just
that
identical
individual
maybe
he
said
absently
then
after
another
pause
do
you
remember
that
wolansky
died
suddenly
just
a
little
while
before
the
end
of
the
school
year
i
nodded
i
imagine
that
was
a
great
piece
of
good
luck
for
you
i
said
yes
said
banaotovich
if
he
had
lived
i
should
never
have
had
my
diploma
as
it
was
i
finished
with
honors
if
wolansky
hadn't
died
when
he
did
i'd
have
been
ruined
don't
forget
that--ruined
i
was
puzzled
at
his
insistence
yes
you
would
have
been
seriously
handicapped
i
agreed
ruined
is
the
word
perhaps
banaotovich's
face
was
purple
with
wine
and
some
strange
kind
of
suffering
do
you
remember
another
thing
he
said
thickly
do
you
remember
an
old
hindoo
who
had
a
dark
little
hole
away
back
of
the
shops
and
the
beer
depot
and
the
livery
stables
between
the
old
market
and
the
river
the
old
fellow
that
had
love
charms
and
told
fortunes
and
helped
people
to
health
and
wealth
and
happiness
i
said
in
a
tone
of
slightly
forced
cheerfulness
it
was
hard
to
be
cheerful
with
those
somber
eyes
boring
into
you
yes
i
remember
him
all
right
i
wanted
to
go
and
see
him
once
when
i
was
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
but
father
told
me
that
meddling
with
the
black
art
had
sent
more
people
to
hell
than
it
had
helped
and
father
was
so
terribly
earnest
about
it
that
he
frightened
me
i
never
went
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
only
a
passing
fancy
and
i
soon
forgot
all
about
him
that
hindoo
said
my
old
school-fellow
thoughtfully
knew
things
about
the
secret
forces
in
the
universe
that
made
him
almost
a
god
and
he
taught
me
things
that
the
wisest
philosopher
in
the
world
doesn't
suspect
still
your
father
may
have
been
right
i
think
it
very
likely
that
what
he
taught
me
may
send
me
to
hell
i
shivered
i
looked
up
nervously
to
make
sure
that
the
way
was
clear
to
the
door
i
began
to
suspect
that
my
friend
banaotovich
though
he
was
certainly
not
a
criminal
might
be
a
dangerous
lunatic
my
vis-ã
-vis
rubbed
absently
at
a
protuberance
on
his
left
side
i
had
noticed
it
when
he
first
came
across
the
room
to
speak
to
me
a
deformity--i
was
sure
it
had
not
been
there
when
he
was
a
boy--or
perhaps
a
tumor
or
some
such
thing
as
that
i
kept
very
quiet
about
what
the
hindoo
taught
me
because
i
knew
most
people
felt
about
such
things
much
as
you
say
your
father
did
and
i
wanted
to
get
on
in
the
world
but
i
had
an
idea
the
hindoo
could
help
me
get
on
perhaps
he
has----
and
he
stared
gloomily
at
space
perhaps
he
has
and
perhaps
he
hasn't
he
brooded
then
he
took
up
the
thread
of
his
story
wolansky
nearly
drove
me
to
suicide
i
read
and
studied
and
crammed
day
and
night
i
tried
everything
i
could
think
of
to
overcome
the
man's
antagonism
i
crawled
in
the
dust
before
him
like
a
whipped
cur
nothing
did
any
good
and
when
i
saw
he
hated
me
and
was
determined
to
smash
me
i
began
to
hate
him
too
i
came
to
hate
him
worse
than
i
hated
the
devils
in
hell
there
was
a
time
when
i
had
to
hold
myself
back
with
all
my
strength
to
keep
from
sticking
a
knife
into
him
or
braining
him
with
a
chair
but
the
hindoo
and
i
made
some
experiments
with
telepathy
and
i
discovered
that
there
are
other
ways
of
killing
a
man
besides
stabbing
him
or
giving
him
poison
i
learned
how
to
make
a
man
in
front
of
me
on
the
street
turn
around
and
look
at
me
i
learned
how
to
make
you
dream
about
me
and
come
and
tell
me
the
dream
the
next
morning
when
he
said
that
i
jumped
for
i
remembered
having
done
exactly
that
thing
i
learned
how
to
bring
out
a
bruise
on
wolansky's
face
although
he
lived
on
the
other
side
of
town
so
that
he
went
around
asking
people
how
he
could
have
bumped
his
forehead
without
knowing
it
and
at
last
i
went
to
bed
one
night
set
my
mind
on
wolansky
and
said
over
and
over
to
myself
a
thousand
times
die
you
dog
you've
got
to
die
i
order
you
to
die
i
said
it
over
till
i
fell
into
a
sort
of
trance
it
wasn't
sleep
i
tell
you
you
can't
sleep
when
you
are
in
a
state
like
that
and
in
my
trance
i
could
feel
another
arm
grow
out
of
my
side
here
and
grow
longer
and
longer
and
grow
out
through
the
window
although
the
window
was
closed
and
grow
out
across
the
street
and
down
the
street
and
right
through
the
walls
and
across
the
river
i
had
never
known
where
wolansky
lived
but
that
night
i
knew
i
had
never
known
the
street
or
the
house
number
i
had
never
been
there
in
my
life
but
i
can
tell
you
just
exactly
how
his
bedroom
looked
the
wash-stand
between
the
two
windows
the
work-table
against
the
west
wall
the
wardrobe
the
old
divan
against
the
north
wall
in
a
corner
the
blue-gray
tiled
stove
with
some
of
the
tile
chipped
off
and
against
the
south
wall--the
bed
he
lay
in
i
can
tell
you
the
color
of
the
blanket
he
pulled
up
over
his
face
it
was
a
dirty
brownish
red
but
my
hand
seemed
to
go
through
the
blanket
and
grip
wolansky
by
the
throat
first
he
sighed
and
turned
his
head
to
one
side
and
tried
to
wriggle
free
then
he
raised
his
arms
and
tried
to
get
hold
of
something
that
wasn't
there
his
sighs
turned
into
groans
and
the
groans
changed
to
a
death
rattle
he
threw
his
arms
and
legs
wildly
around
in
the
air
his
body
bent
up
like
a
bow
but
my
hand
held
his
head
down
against
the
pillow
at
last
he
quit
struggling
and
dropped
down
limp
on
the
bed
then
the
arm
came
crawling
back
in
to
my
body
and
i
came
out
of
the
trance--and
went
to
sleep--or
perhaps
i
fainted
the
next
morning
the
director
came
into
our
classroom
and
told
us
wolansky
had
died
in
the
night
of
some
sort
of
attack
you
remember
that
i
am
sure----
when
banaotovich
began
to
tell
me
this
story
he
had
looked
away
from
me
and
his
eyes
never
met
mine
during
the
telling
he
had
begun
with
a
painful
effort
but
as
he
went
on
he
grew
more
and
more
excited
and
more
and
more
inflamed
with
hatred
of
the
malicious
old
greek
teacher
till
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
had
forgotten
me
and
was
living
the
astounding
experience
through
for
himself
alone
when
he
was
through
his
ecstasy
of
indignation
left
him
and
he
sat
dejected
and
apprehensive
studying
me
pitifully
out
of
the
corners
of
his
deep
gray
eyes





when
he
stopped
speaking
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
then
i
said
something
i
think
what
i
said
was
very
extraordinary
he
smiled
a
strained
sarcastic
smile
extraordinary
he
repeated
with
an
interrogation
point
in
his
voice
your
nerves
were
strained
to
the
breaking-point
i
said
your
trouble
with
the
old
rascal
had
driven
you
half
distracted
then
there
was
all
that
occultistic
hodgepodge
with
the
old
hindoo
and
you
were
overworked
and
run
down
anyway
no
wonder
you
dreamed
dreams
and
saw
visions
and
it
may
have
been
that
there
was
some
telepathic
contact
between
you
and
wolansky
and
when
he
had
his
apoplectic
attack----
the
sarcastic
smile
deepened
on
banaotovich's
face
so
you
have
it
all
explained
and
i'm
acquitted
he
inquired
acquitted
i
cried
you
were
never
even
accused
if
the
state
were
to
bring
action
against
every
man
who
had
a
feeling
that
he
would
be
happier
if
someone
else
were
out
of
the
way
the
state
would
have
a
big
job
on
its
hands
very
true
banaotovich
assented
icily
i
see
i
haven't
got
very
far
with
you
yet
you
are
forcing
me
to
continue
my
not
very
edifying
autobiography--did
you
know
my
father
i
remembered
his
father
and
i
remembered
that
he
had
not
enjoyed
the
best
possible
reputation
i
think
i
knew
him
i
said
hesitantly
he
was
a--a
money-lender
wasn't
he
don't
spare
my
feelings
said
banaotovich
bitterly
he
was
a
usurer
and
a
cruel
one
i
had
a
feeling
for
years
that
his
business
was
a
disgrace
to
the
family
and
i
made
no
bones
about
telling
him
so
there
were
ugly
scenes
i
thought
several
times
of
leaving
home
finally
father
told
me
one
day
that
since
i
didn't
approve
of
the
way
he
got
his
money
he
was
doing
me
the
favor
of
disinheriting
me
i
told
him
that
was
all
right
with
me
that
i'd
rather
starve
than
live
on
money
that
was
stained
with
the
blood
of
poor
debtors
i
thought
at
the
time
that
i
meant
it
but
about
that
time
i
had
become
interested
in
a
young
woman
i
had
never
had
much
to
do
with
the
girls
and
very
few
of
them
seemed
at
all
interested
in
me
but
this
one
appeared
to
like
me
and
when
i
made
advances
to
her
she
didn't
repel
me
i
am
no
connoisseur
of
female
beauty
but
i
think
she
was
unusually
attractive
and
at
that
time
i
was
half
mad
about
her
still
waters
run
deep
you
know
well
she
had
me
under
her
spell
so
completely
that
i
changed
my
mind
about
father's
money
i
began
to
truckle
to
him
much
as
i
had
truckled
to
wolansky
i
began
to
feel
him
out
to
find
whether
he
had
made
a
will
he
was
very
cold
and
non-committal
finally
i
asked
him
outright
if
he
would
reconsider
his
decision
to
leave
me
penniless
he
told
me
it
was
i
that
had
made
the
decision
not
he
and
that
he
had
no
use
for
wishy-washy
people
that
changed
their
minds
like
weather-cocks
he
was
very
sarcastic
i
lost
my
temper
and
answered
him
back
we
had
a
terrible
quarrel
and
finally
he--he
struck
me
i
was
twenty
years
old
and
a
bigger
man
than
he
and
i
think
no
man
ever
had
more
stubborn
pride
at
bottom
than
i
have
it
was
the
wolansky
thing
all
over
again
the
humiliation
the
effort
at
ingratiation
the
failure
the
long
eating
gnawing
growing
hatred
and
it--it
ended
the
same
way
the
night
of
brooding
that
hardened
into
a
devilish
decision
the
vision
of
the
long
arm
growing
stretching
crawling--but
not
so
far
this
time
only
through
two
walls
and
across
our
own
house
you
remember
that
father
died
of
an
apoplectic
stroke
just
as
wolansky
had
done
a
year
or
two
before
yes
i
think
i
remember
i
said
in
considerable
embarrassment
the
thing
did
begin
to
look
uncanny
i
was
thoroughly
sorry
for
the
poor
cracked
fellow
but
i
would
just
as
soon
not
have
been
alone
with
him
in
that
solitary
drinking-place
in
the
twilight
well
he
said
almost
sharply
well
banaotovich
i
answered
with
a
show
of
confidence
you
have
had
a
great
deal
of
unhappiness
and
you
have
my
sympathy
this
strange
faculty
you
have
of
anticipating
deaths
like
the
night-owls
and
the
death-watch
that
ticks
in
the
walls
has
made
these
bereavements
an
occasion
of
self-torment
for
you
i
think
you
should
see
a
psychiatrist
anticipating--anticipating
banaotovich
had
gone
back
and
was
repeating
a
word
i
had
used
and
as
he
repeated
it
he
drummed
madly
on
the
table
with
his
fingers
it's
a
curious
coincidence
that
'anticipating'
is
just
the
word
my
wife
used
when
i
told
her
about
it
you--told--your
wife--what
you
have
just
told
me
i
stammered
do
you
think
that
was
wise
i
couldn't
help
it
he
said
with
a
catch
in
his
throat
i
thought
i
loved
her
and
i
had
to
talk
to
somebody
i
was
miserable
and
i
had
a
feeling
that
she
might
understand
and
be
brought
closer
to
me
by
sympathy
now
that
i
think
of
it
i
can
see
that
i
was
an
egregious
idiot
but
i
discovered
long
ago
that
we
aren't
rational
beings
after
all
we
are
driven
or
drawn
by
mysterious
forces
and
we
go
to
our
destination
because
we
can't
help
it
my
wife
had
always
seemed
a
little
timid
with
me
i
never
seemed
to
have
the
gift
of
attracting
people
and
i
don't
know
whether
she
would
ever
have
been
interested
in
me
at
all
if
i
hadn't
used
a
little--a
little
charm
the
hindoo
taught
me
perhaps
that
didn't
have
much
to
do
with
it--but
i
had
never
been
happy
with
her
however
that
may
be
one
evening
when
she
seemed
unusually
approachable
i
had
just
the
same
impulse
that
i
had
when
i
met
you
here
tonight
and
i
told
her
about
wolansky
and
father
she
pooh-poohed
it
all
just
as
you
did
but
she
was
afraid
i
could
see
that
she
was
more
and
more
afraid
of
me
as
the
days
went
by
for
a
long
time
she
tried
to
be
cordial
and
natural
in
my
presence
but
it
was
a
sham
and
the
poor
thing
couldn't
keep
it
up
each
of
us
knew
as
well
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
other
as
if
we
had
talked
the
situation
over
frankly
for
hours
we
reached
the
point
where
we
couldn't
look
each
other
in
the
face
no
solitude
could
have
been
as
ghastly
as
that
solitude
of
two
people
who
shared
a
revolting
secret
for
i
had
convinced
her
that
i
was
guilty
i
had
succeeded
in
doing
what
i
had
set
out
to
do
and
i
had
ruined
two
lives
in
doing
it
i
have
the
faculty
it
seems
of
poisoning
whatever
i
touch
only
today
my
wife
said
to
me----
i
started
to
my
feet
with
a
great
rush
of
relief
and
thankfulness
ah
your
wife
is
alive
then
i
cried
my
wife
is
alive
that
is--my
second
wife
is
alive
he
said
with
a
horrible
forced
smile
i
sank
back
gasping
what
did
you
do
with
your
first
wife
you
dirty
hound
i
moaned
in
helpless
indignation





he
closed
his
eyes
and
a
wave
of
bitter
triumph
played
about
the
muscles
of
his
mouth
have
i
convinced
you
too
at
last
he
said
then
i
realized
that
i
had
been
an
insulting
idiot
at
worst
the
man
before
me
was
a
pathological
case
and
he
certainly
belonged
in
an
asylum
rather
than
in
a
prison
forgive
me
banaotovich
i
panted
i
don't
know
what
made
me----
he
looked
at
me
sadly
almost
compassionately
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
he
said
very
quietly
i
am
all
you
called
me
and
a
thousand
times
worse
now
let
me
finish
my
story
you
don't
need
to
i
said
hastily
i
know
all
the
rest
of
it
all
interest
i
am
afraid
nearly
all
sympathy
had
gone
out
of
me
what
i
wanted
most
of
all
was
to
get
away
from
this
melancholy
citizen
with
power
and
madness
in
his
gray
eyes
no
you
don't
know
quite
all
of
it
yet
he
insisted
perhaps
if
i
tell
you
the
whole
story
even
if
you
can't
excuse
me--and
i
don't
deserve
your
excusing
i
don't
want
your
excusing--you
can
understand
me
a
little
better
and
think
of
me
a
little
more
kindly
there
was
another
woman
i
couldn't
help
it
any
more
than
any
of
us
can
help
anything
a
fine
sympathetic
young
woman
who
loved
me
because
she
knew
i
was
unhappy
i
had
been
married
to
the
other
woman
for
four
years
we
were
completely
estranged
we
could
scarcely
bear
to
speak
to
each
other
i
couldn't
be
easy
one
moment
in
the
same
house
with
her
i
had
a
cot
in
my
office
out
in
town
because
i
couldn't
even
sleep
soundly
at
home
it
was
hell
the
terror
in
her
eyes
made
me
physically
sick
my
wife
learned
about
the
other
woman
my
wife
was
a
devout
catholic
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
divorce
i
could
read
in
my
wife's
face
just
what
went
on
in
her
mind
she
knew
the
other
woman
had
become
my
only
reason
for
living
and
one
day
i
read
in
her
eyes
along
with
the
terror
a
glint
of
desperate
determination
she
knew
she
was
in
danger
she
knew
i
had
a
power
that
i
could
exercise
when
i
chose
in
spite
of
all
the
courts
and
police
and
jails
in
the
country
she
knew
her
life
was
in
danger
and
her
eyes
told
me
that
mine
was
in
danger
for
that
very
reason
i
didn't
blame
her
half
my
grief
through
all
the
years
had
been
grief
for
her
but
the
instinct
of
self-defense
in
me
was
strong--and--she
went--too--like----
illustration
and
she
went
too
like
the
other
he
never
finished
his
sentence
he
dropped
his
head
on
the
table
and
began
to
sob
hysterically
i
laid
a
gingerly
hand
on
his
shoulder
banaotovich
i
said
unsteadily
i'm
sorry
for
you----
he
sat
up
and
supported
his
chin
in
both
hands
i
haven't
been
as--as
bad
as
all
this
sounds
like
he
said
after
a
while
before
i
was
married
a
second
time
i
went
to
the
chief
of
police
and
gave
myself
up
the
chief
listened
to
my
story--i
didn't
try
to
explain
it
all
as
i've
done
with
you
but
just
blurted
out
the
main
facts
but
the
longer
he
listened
the
uneasier
he
became
and
when
i
got
through
he
asked
me
nervously
if
i
didn't
think
i
ought
to
go
into
a
sanitarium
for
a
while
then
he
bowed
me
out
in
a
big
hurry
perhaps
if
i
had
told
him
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
it
might
have
been
different----
but
don't
you
think
he's
right
about
the
sanitarium
right
i'm
as
sane
as
you
are
i've
killed
three
people
a
crazy
scoundrel
a
hard
man
and
a
pure
innocent
woman
but
i
did
it
all
because
i
had
to
a
sanitarium
wouldn't
do
me
or
anyone
else
any
good
and
it
would
be
a
heavy
expense
i
have
taken
the
responsibility
for
another
pure
innocent
woman
and
i
must
support
her
the
war
and
the
depression
swept
away
my
father's
fortune
and
my
present
business
has
dwindled
away
till
i
am
making
only
the
barest
living
i
have
applied
for
the
agency
for
a
big
berlin
insurance
company
and
if
i
can
get
it
along
with
my
other
business
i
shall
be
fairly
comfortable
but
i
understand
there
is
some
talk
of
their
sending
in
a
representative
from
outside
if
they
do
that
if
they
take
the
bread
out
of
my
mouth
like
that
it
won't
be
good
for
the
outsider
he
was
drunk
and
his
drunkenness
was
working
him
into
an
ugly
mood
he
was
dangerous
and
physical
courage
was
never
my
strong
point
what
is
the
name
of
the
berlin
company
i
asked
timidly
he
named
the
firm
i
myself
worked
for
then
he
fumbled
for
his
bottle
and
with
stern
and
painful
attention
set
about
the
difficult
and
delicate
task
of
filling
his
glass
again
i
muttered
something
about
being
back
in
a
moment
and
made
for
the
door
he
was
too
busy
to
pay
any
attention
to
me
when
i
had
the
door
safely
shut
behind
me
i
sprinted
through
the
rain
to
my
hotel
as
if
the
devil
himself
were
after
me





it
was
a
long
time
before
i
got
over
waking
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
the
feeling
that
an
icy
iron-muscled
hand
was
clutching
at
my
throat
i
don't
have
the
experience
often
any
more
but
i
have
never
seen
the
city
of
my
birth
since
that
awful
night
i
got
out
on
the
midnight
train
and
my
company
obligingly
gave
me
territory
on
the
other
side
of
germany
some
time
ago
i
happened
to
see
a
notice
in
the
paper
to
the
effect
that
a
certain
patient
named
g
banaotovich
had
died
suddenly
in
the
staatliche
nervenheilanstalt
in
nuremberg
but
i
have
met
the
name
rather
frequently
of
late
and
i
think
it
is
a
fairly
common
one
i
didn't
investigate
