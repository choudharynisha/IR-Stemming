i
awoke
from
profound
sleep
to
find
two
black-swathed
forms
standing
silently
beside
me
their
faces
pale
blurs
in
the
gloom
as
i
blinked
to
clear
my
sleep-dimmed
eyes
one
of
them
beckoned
impatiently
and
suddenly
i
realized
the
purpose
of
this
midnight
summons
for
years
i
had
been
expecting
it
ever
since
my
father
the
baron
kralitz
had
revealed
to
me
the
secret
and
the
curse
that
hung
over
our
ancient
house
and
so
without
a
word
i
rose
and
followed
my
guides
as
they
led
me
along
the
gloomy
corridors
of
the
castle
that
had
been
my
home
since
birth
as
i
proceeded
there
rose
up
in
my
mind
the
stern
face
of
my
father
and
in
my
ears
rang
his
solemn
words
as
he
told
me
of
the
legendary
curse
of
the
house
of
kralitz
the
unknown
secret
that
was
imparted
to
the
eldest
son
of
each
generation--at
a
certain
time
when
i
had
asked
my
father
as
he
lay
on
his
death-bed
fighting
back
the
approach
of
dissolution
when
you
are
able
to
understand
he
had
told
me
watching
my
face
intently
from
beneath
his
tufted
white
brows
some
are
told
the
secret
sooner
than
others
since
the
first
baron
kralitz
the
secret
has
been
handed
down----
he
clutched
at
his
breast
and
paused
it
was
fully
five
minutes
before
he
had
gathered
his
strength
to
speak
again
in
his
rolling
powerful
voice
no
gasping
death-bed
confessions
for
the
baron
kralitz
he
said
at
last
you
have
seen
the
ruins
of
the
old
monastery
near
the
village
franz
the
first
baron
burnt
it
and
put
the
monks
to
the
sword
the
abbot
interfered
too
often
with
the
baron's
whims
a
girl
sought
shelter
and
the
abbot
refused
to
give
her
up
at
the
baron's
demand
his
patience
was
at
an
end--you
know
the
tales
they
still
tell
about
him
he
slew
the
abbot
burned
the
monastery
and
took
the
girl
before
he
died
the
abbot
cursed
his
slayer
and
cursed
his
sons
for
unborn
generations
and
it
is
the
nature
of
this
curse
that
is
the
secret
of
our
house
i
may
not
tell
you
what
the
curse
is
do
not
seek
to
discover
it
before
it
is
revealed
to
you
wait
patiently
and
in
due
time
you
will
be
taken
by
the
warders
of
the
secret
down
the
stairway
to
the
underground
cavern
and
then
you
will
learn
the
secret
of
kralitz
as
the
last
word
passed
my
father's
lips
he
died
his
stern
face
still
set
in
its
harsh
lines





deep
in
my
memories
i
had
not
noticed
our
path
but
now
the
dark
forms
of
my
guides
paused
beside
a
gap
in
the
stone
flagging
where
a
stairway
which
i
had
never
seen
during
my
wanderings
about
the
castle
led
into
subterranean
depths
down
this
stairway
i
was
conducted
and
presently
i
came
to
realize
that
there
was
light
of
a
sort--a
dim
phosphorescent
radiance
that
came
from
no
recognizable
source
and
seemed
to
be
less
actual
light
than
the
accustoming
of
my
eyes
to
the
near-darkness
i
went
down
for
a
long
time
the
stairway
turned
and
twisted
in
the
rock
and
the
bobbing
forms
ahead
were
my
only
relief
from
the
monotony
of
the
interminable
descent
and
at
last
deep
underground
the
long
stairway
ended
and
i
gazed
over
the
shoulders
of
my
guides
at
the
great
door
that
barred
my
path
it
was
roughly
chiseled
from
the
solid
stone
and
upon
it
were
curious
and
strangely
disquieting
carvings
symbols
which
i
did
not
recognize
it
swung
open
and
i
passed
through
and
paused
staring
about
me
through
a
gray
sea
of
mist
i
stood
upon
a
gentle
slope
that
fell
away
into
the
fog-hidden
distance
from
which
came
a
pandemonium
of
muffled
bellowing
and
high-pitched
shrill
squeakings
vaguely
akin
to
obscene
laughter
dark
half-glimpsed
shapes
swam
into
sight
through
the
haze
and
disappeared
again
and
great
vague
shadows
swept
overhead
on
silent
wings
almost
beside
me
was
a
long
rectangular
table
of
stone
and
at
this
table
two
score
of
men
were
seated
watching
me
from
eyes
that
gleamed
dully
out
of
deep
sockets
my
two
guides
silently
took
their
places
among
them
and
suddenly
the
thick
fog
began
to
lift
it
was
swept
raggedly
away
on
the
breath
of
a
chill
wind
the
far
dim
reaches
of
the
cavern
were
revealed
as
the
mist
swiftly
dissipated
and
i
stood
silent
in
the
grip
of
a
mighty
fear
and
strangely
an
equally
potent
unaccountable
thrill
of
delight
a
part
of
my
mind
seemed
to
ask
what
horror
is
this
and
another
part
whispered
you
know
this
place
but
i
could
never
have
seen
it
before
if
i
had
realized
what
lay
far
beneath
the
castle
i
could
never
have
slept
at
night
for
the
fear
that
would
have
obsessed
me
for
standing
silent
with
conflicting
tides
of
horror
and
ecstasy
racing
through
me
i
saw
the
weird
inhabitants
of
the
underground
world
demons
monsters
unnamable
things
nightmare
colossi
strode
bellowing
through
the
murk
and
amorphous
gray
things
like
giant
slugs
walked
upright
on
stumpy
legs
creatures
of
shapeless
soft
pulp
beings
with
flame-shot
eyes
scattered
over
their
misshapen
bodies
like
fabled
argus
writhed
and
twisted
there
in
the
evil
glow
winged
things
that
were
not
bats
swooped
and
fluttered
in
the
tenebrous
air
whispering
sibilantly--whispering
in
human
voices
far
away
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
i
could
see
the
chill
gleam
of
water
a
hidden
sunless
sea
shapes
mercifully
almost
hidden
by
distance
and
the
semi-darkness
sported
and
cried
troubling
the
surface
of
the
lake
the
size
of
which
i
could
only
conjecture
and
a
flapping
thing
whose
leathery
wings
stretched
like
a
tent
above
my
head
swooped
and
hovered
for
a
moment
staring
with
flaming
eyes
and
then
darted
off
and
was
lost
in
the
gloom
and
all
the
while
as
i
shuddered
with
fear
and
loathing
within
me
was
this
evil
glee--this
voice
which
whispered
you
know
this
place
you
belong
here
is
it
not
good
to
be
home
i
glanced
behind
me
the
great
door
had
swung
silently
shut
and
escape
was
impossible
and
then
pride
came
to
my
aid
i
was
a
kralitz
and
a
kralitz
would
not
acknowledge
fear
in
the
face
of
the
devil
himself





i
stepped
forward
and
confronted
the
warders
who
were
still
seated
regarding
me
intently
from
eyes
in
which
a
smoldering
fire
seemed
to
burn
fighting
down
an
insane
dread
that
i
might
find
before
me
an
array
of
fleshless
skeletons
i
stepped
to
the
head
of
the
table
where
there
was
a
sort
of
crude
throne
and
peered
closely
at
the
silent
figure
on
my
right
it
was
no
bare
skull
at
which
i
gazed
but
a
bearded
deadly-pale
face
the
curved
voluptuous
lips
were
crimson
looking
almost
rouged
and
the
dull
eyes
stared
through
me
bleakly
inhuman
agony
had
etched
itself
in
deep
lines
on
the
white
face
and
gnawing
anguish
smoldered
in
the
sunken
eyes
i
cannot
hope
to
convey
the
utter
strangeness
the
atmosphere
of
unearthliness
that
surrounded
him
almost
as
palpable
as
the
fetid
tomb-stench
that
welled
from
his
dark
garments
he
waved
a
black-swathed
arm
to
the
vacant
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
i
sat
down
this
nightmare
sense
of
unreality
i
seemed
to
be
in
a
dream
with
a
hidden
part
of
my
mind
slowly
waking
from
sleep
into
evil
life
to
take
command
of
my
faculties
the
table
was
set
with
old-fashioned
goblets
and
trenchers
such
as
had
not
been
used
for
hundreds
of
years
there
was
meat
on
the
trenchers
and
red
liquor
in
the
jeweled
goblets
a
heady
overpowering
fragrance
swam
up
into
my
nostrils
mixed
with
the
grave-smell
of
my
companions
and
the
musty
odor
of
a
dank
and
sunless
place
every
white
face
was
turned
to
me
faces
that
seemed
oddly
familiar
although
i
did
not
know
why
each
face
was
alike
in
its
blood-red
sensual
lips
and
its
expression
of
gnawing
agony
and
burning
black
eyes
like
the
abysmal
pits
of
tartarus
stared
at
me
until
i
felt
the
short
hairs
stir
on
my
neck
but--i
was
a
kralitz
i
stood
up
and
said
boldly
in
archaic
german
that
somehow
came
familiarly
from
my
lips
i
am
franz
twenty-first
baron
kralitz
what
do
you
want
with
me
a
murmur
of
approval
went
around
the
long
table
there
was
a
stir
from
the
foot
of
the
board
a
huge
bearded
man
arose
a
man
with
a
frightful
scar
that
made
the
left
side
of
his
face
a
horror
of
healed
white
tissue
again
the
odd
thrill
of
familiarity
ran
through
me
i
had
seen
that
face
before
and
vaguely
i
remembered
looking
at
it
through
dim
twilight
the
man
spoke
in
the
old
guttural
german
we
greet
you
franz
baron
kralitz
we
greet
you
and
pledge
you
franz--and
we
pledge
the
house
of
kralitz
with
that
he
caught
up
the
goblet
before
him
and
held
it
high
all
along
the
long
table
the
black-swathed
ones
arose
and
each
held
high
his
jeweled
cup
and
pledged
me
they
drank
deeply
savoring
the
liquor
and
i
made
the
bow
custom
demanded
i
said
in
words
that
sprang
almost
unbidden
from
my
mouth
i
greet
you
who
are
the
warders
of
the
secret
of
kralitz
and
i
pledge
you
in
return
all
about
me
to
the
farthermost
reaches
of
the
dim
cavern
a
hush
fell
and
the
bellows
and
howlings
and
the
insane
tittering
of
the
flying
things
were
no
longer
heard
my
companions
leaned
expectantly
toward
me
standing
alone
at
the
head
of
the
board
i
raised
my
goblet
and
drank
the
liquor
was
heady
exhilarating
with
a
faintly
brackish
flavor
and
abruptly
i
knew
why
the
pain-racked
ruined
face
of
my
companion
had
seemed
familiar
i
had
seen
it
often
among
the
portraits
of
my
ancestors
the
frowning
disfigured
visage
of
the
founder
of
the
house
of
kralitz
that
glared
down
from
the
gloom
of
the
great
hall
in
that
fierce
white
light
of
revelation
i
knew
my
companions
for
what
they
were
i
recognized
them
one
by
one
remembering
their
canvas
counterparts
but
there
was
a
change
like
an
impalpable
veil
the
stamp
of
ineradicable
evil
lay
on
the
tortured
faces
of
my
hosts
strangely
altering
their
features
so
that
i
could
not
always
be
sure
i
recognized
them
one
pale
sardonic
face
reminded
me
of
my
father
but
i
could
not
be
sure
so
monstrously
altered
was
its
expression
i
was
dining
with
my
ancestors--the
house
of
kralitz
my
cup
was
still
held
high
and
i
drained
it
for
somehow
the
grim
revelation
was
not
entirely
unexpected
a
strange
glow
thrilled
through
my
veins
and
i
laughed
aloud
for
the
evil
delight
that
was
in
me
the
others
laughed
too
a
deep-throated
merriment
like
the
barking
of
wolves--tortured
laughter
from
men
stretched
on
the
rack
mad
laughter
in
hell
and
all
through
the
hazy
cavern
came
the
clamor
of
the
devil's
brood
great
figures
that
towered
many
spans
high
rocked
with
thundering
glee
and
the
flying
things
tittered
slyly
overhead
and
out
over
the
vast
expanse
swept
the
wave
of
frightful
mirth
until
the
half-seen
things
in
the
black
waters
sent
out
bellows
that
tore
at
my
eardrums
and
the
unseen
roof
far
overhead
sent
back
roaring
echoes
of
the
clamor
and
i
laughed
with
them
laughed
insanely
until
i
dropped
exhausted
into
my
seat
and
watched
the
scarred
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
as
he
spoke
you
are
worthy
to
be
of
our
company
and
worthy
to
eat
at
the
same
board
we
have
pledged
each
other
and
you
are
one
of
us
we
shall
eat
together
and
we
fell
to
tearing
like
hungry
beasts
at
the
succulent
white
meat
in
the
jeweled
trenchers
strange
monsters
served
us
and
at
a
chill
touch
on
my
arm
i
turned
to
find
a
dreadful
crimson
thing
like
a
skinned
child
refilling
my
goblet
strange
strange
and
utterly
blasphemous
was
our
feast
we
shouted
and
laughed
and
fed
there
in
the
hazy
light
while
all
around
us
thundered
the
evil
horde
there
was
hell
beneath
castle
kralitz
and
it
held
high
carnival
this
night





presently
we
sang
a
fierce
drinking-song
swinging
the
deep
cups
back
and
forth
in
rhythm
with
our
shouted
chant
it
was
an
archaic
song
but
the
obsolete
words
were
no
handicap
for
i
mouthed
them
as
though
they
had
been
learned
at
my
mother's
knee
and
at
the
thought
of
my
mother
a
trembling
and
a
weakness
ran
through
me
abruptly
but
i
banished
it
with
a
draft
of
the
heady
liquor
long
long
we
shouted
and
sang
and
caroused
there
in
the
great
cavern
and
after
a
time
we
arose
together
and
trooped
to
where
a
narrow
high-arched
bridge
spanned
the
tenebrous
waters
of
the
lake
but
i
may
not
speak
of
what
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
nor
of
the
unnamable
things
that
i
saw--and
did
i
learned
of
the
fungoid
inhuman
beings
that
dwell
on
far
cold
yuggoth
of
the
cyclopean
shapes
that
attend
unsleeping
cthulhu
in
his
submarine
city
of
the
strange
pleasures
that
the
followers
of
leprous
subterranean
yog-sothoth
may
possess
and
i
learned
too
of
the
unbelievable
manner
in
which
iod
the
source
is
worshipped
beyond
the
outer
galaxies
i
plumbed
the
blackest
pits
of
hell
and
came
back--laughing
i
was
one
with
the
rest
of
those
dark
warders
and
i
joined
them
in
the
saturnalia
of
horror
until
the
scarred
man
spoke
to
us
again
our
time
grows
short
he
said
his
scarred
and
bearded
white
face
like
a
gargoyle's
in
the
half-light
we
must
depart
soon
but
you
are
a
true
kralitz
franz
and
we
shall
meet
again
and
feast
again
and
make
merry
for
longer
than
you
think
one
last
pledge
i
gave
it
to
him
to
the
house
of
kralitz
may
it
never
fall
and
with
an
exultant
shout
we
drained
the
pungent
dregs
of
the
liquor
then
a
strange
lassitude
fell
upon
me
with
the
others
i
turned
my
back
on
the
cavern
and
the
shapes
that
pranced
and
bellowed
and
crawled
there
and
i
went
up
through
the
carved
stone
portal
we
filed
up
the
stairs
up
and
up
endlessly
until
at
last
we
emerged
through
the
gaping
hole
in
the
stone
flags
and
proceeded
a
dark
silent
company
back
through
those
interminable
corridors
the
surroundings
began
to
grow
strangely
familiar
and
suddenly
i
recognized
them
we
were
in
the
great
burial
vaults
below
the
castle
where
the
barons
kralitz
were
ceremoniously
entombed
each
baron
had
been
placed
in
his
stone
casket
in
his
separate
chamber
and
each
chamber
lay
like
beads
on
a
necklace
adjacent
to
the
next
so
that
we
proceeded
from
the
farthermost
tombs
of
the
early
barons
kralitz
toward
the
unoccupied
vaults
by
immemorial
custom
each
tomb
lay
bare
an
empty
mausoleum
until
the
time
had
come
for
its
use
when
the
great
stone
coffin
with
the
memorial
inscription
carved
upon
it
would
be
carried
to
its
place
it
was
fitting
indeed
for
the
secret
of
kralitz
to
be
hidden
here
abruptly
i
realized
that
i
was
alone
save
for
the
bearded
man
with
the
disfiguring
scar
the
others
had
vanished
and
deep
in
my
thoughts
i
had
not
missed
them
my
companion
stretched
out
his
black-swathed
arm
and
halted
my
progress
and
i
turned
to
him
questioningly
he
said
in
his
sonorous
voice
i
must
leave
you
now
i
must
go
back
to
my
own
place
and
he
pointed
to
the
way
whence
we
had
come
i
nodded
for
i
had
already
recognized
my
companions
for
what
they
were
i
knew
that
each
baron
kralitz
had
been
laid
in
his
tomb
only
to
arise
as
a
monstrous
thing
neither
dead
nor
alive
to
descend
into
the
cavern
below
and
take
part
in
the
evil
saturnalia
i
realized
too
that
with
the
approach
of
dawn
they
had
returned
to
their
stone
coffins
to
lie
in
a
death-like
trance
until
the
setting
sun
should
bring
brief
liberation
my
own
occult
studies
had
enabled
me
to
recognize
these
dreadful
manifestations
i
bowed
to
my
companion
and
would
have
proceeded
on
my
way
to
the
upper
parts
of
the
castle
but
he
barred
my
path
he
shook
his
head
slowly
his
scar
hideous
in
the
phosphorescent
gloom
i
said
may
i
not
go
yet
he
stared
at
me
with
tortured
smoldering
eyes
that
had
looked
into
hell
itself
and
he
pointed
to
what
lay
beside
me
and
in
a
flash
of
nightmare
realization
i
knew
the
secret
of
the
curse
of
kralitz
there
came
to
me
the
knowledge
that
made
my
brain
a
frightful
thing
in
which
shapes
of
darkness
would
ever
swirl
and
scream
the
dreadful
comprehension
of
when
each
baron
kralitz
was
initiated
into
the
brotherhood
of
blood
i
knew--i
knew--that
no
coffin
had
ever
been
placed
unoccupied
in
the
tombs
and
i
read
upon
the
stone
sarcophagus
at
my
feet
the
inscription
that
made
my
doom
known
to
me--my
own
name
franz
twenty-first
