l
advertisement
the
first
idea
of
this
romance
was
suggested
by
the
story
of
the
santon
barsisa
related
in
the
guardian--the
bleeding
nun
is
a
tradition
still
credited
in
many
parts
of
germany
and
i
have
been
told
that
the
ruins
of
the
castle
of
lauenstein
which
she
is
supposed
to
haunt
may
yet
be
seen
upon
the
borders
of
thuringia--the
water-king
from
the
third
to
the
twelfth
stanza
is
the
fragment
of
an
original
danish
ballad--and
belerma
and
durandarte
is
translated
from
some
stanzas
to
be
found
in
a
collection
of
old
spanish
poetry
which
contains
also
the
popular
song
of
gayferos
and
melesindra
mentioned
in
don
quixote--i
have
now
made
a
full
avowal
of
all
the
plagiarisms
of
which
i
am
aware
myself
but
i
doubt
not
many
more
may
be
found
of
which
i
am
at
present
totally
unconscious
volume
i
----lord
angelo

stands
at
a
guard
with
envy
scarce
confesses
that
his
blood
flows
or
that
his
appetite
is
more
to
bread
than
stone
measure
for
measure
scarcely
had
the
abbey
bell
tolled
for
five
minutes
and
already
was
the
church
of
the
capuchins
thronged
with
auditors
do
not
encourage
the
idea
that
the
crowd
was
assembled
either
from
motives
of
piety
or
thirst
of
information
but
very
few
were
influenced
by
those
reasons
and
in
a
city
where
superstition
reigns
with
such
despotic
sway
as
in
madrid
to
seek
for
true
devotion
would
be
a
fruitless
attempt
the
audience
now
assembled
in
the
capuchin
church
was
collected
by
various
causes
but
all
of
them
were
foreign
to
the
ostensible
motive
the
women
came
to
show
themselves
the
men
to
see
the
women
some
were
attracted
by
curiosity
to
hear
an
orator
so
celebrated
some
came
because
they
had
no
better
means
of
employing
their
time
till
the
play
began
some
from
being
assured
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
places
in
the
church
and
one
half
of
madrid
was
brought
thither
by
expecting
to
meet
the
other
half
the
only
persons
truly
anxious
to
hear
the
preacher
were
a
few
antiquated
devotees
and
half
a
dozen
rival
orators
determined
to
find
fault
with
and
ridicule
the
discourse
as
to
the
remainder
of
the
audience
the
sermon
might
have
been
omitted
altogether
certainly
without
their
being
disappointed
and
very
probably
without
their
perceiving
the
omission
whatever
was
the
occasion
it
is
at
least
certain
that
the
capuchin
church
had
never
witnessed
a
more
numerous
assembly
every
corner
was
filled
every
seat
was
occupied
the
very
statues
which
ornamented
the
long
aisles
were
pressed
into
the
service
boys
suspended
themselves
upon
the
wings
of
cherubims
st
francis
and
st
mark
bore
each
a
spectator
on
his
shoulders
and
st
agatha
found
herself
under
the
necessity
of
carrying
double
the
consequence
was
that
in
spite
of
all
their
hurry
and
expedition
our
two
newcomers
on
entering
the
church
looked
round
in
vain
for
places
however
the
old
woman
continued
to
move
forwards
in
vain
were
exclamations
of
displeasure
vented
against
her
from
all
sides
in
vain
was
she
addressed
with--'i
assure
you
segnora
there
are
no
places
here'--'i
beg
segnora
that
you
will
not
crowd
me
so
intolerably'--'segnora
you
cannot
pass
this
way
bless
me
how
can
people
be
so
troublesome'--the
old
woman
was
obstinate
and
on
she
went
by
dint
of
perseverance
and
two
brawny
arms
she
made
a
passage
through
the
crowd
and
managed
to
bustle
herself
into
the
very
body
of
the
church
at
no
great
distance
from
the
pulpit
her
companion
had
followed
her
with
timidity
and
in
silence
profiting
by
the
exertions
of
her
conductress
'holy
virgin'
exclaimed
the
old
woman
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
while
she
threw
a
glance
of
enquiry
round
her
'holy
virgin
what
heat
what
a
crowd
i
wonder
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
all
this
i
believe
we
must
return
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
seat
to
be
had
and
nobody
seems
kind
enough
to
accommodate
us
with
theirs'
this
broad
hint
attracted
the
notice
of
two
cavaliers
who
occupied
stools
on
the
right
hand
and
were
leaning
their
backs
against
the
seventh
column
from
the
pulpit
both
were
young
and
richly
habited
hearing
this
appeal
to
their
politeness
pronounced
in
a
female
voice
they
interrupted
their
conversation
to
look
at
the
speaker
she
had
thrown
up
her
veil
in
order
to
take
a
clearer
look
round
the
cathedral
her
hair
was
red
and
she
squinted
the
cavaliers
turned
round
and
renewed
their
conversation
'by
all
means'
replied
the
old
woman's
companion
'by
all
means
leonella
let
us
return
home
immediately
the
heat
is
excessive
and
i
am
terrified
at
such
a
crowd'
these
words
were
pronounced
in
a
tone
of
unexampled
sweetness
the
cavaliers
again
broke
off
their
discourse
but
for
this
time
they
were
not
contented
with
looking
up
both
started
involuntarily
from
their
seats
and
turned
themselves
towards
the
speaker
the
voice
came
from
a
female
the
delicacy
and
elegance
of
whose
figure
inspired
the
youths
with
the
most
lively
curiosity
to
view
the
face
to
which
it
belonged
this
satisfaction
was
denied
them
her
features
were
hidden
by
a
thick
veil
but
struggling
through
the
crowd
had
deranged
it
sufficiently
to
discover
a
neck
which
for
symmetry
and
beauty
might
have
vied
with
the
medicean
venus
it
was
of
the
most
dazzling
whiteness
and
received
additional
charms
from
being
shaded
by
the
tresses
of
her
long
fair
hair
which
descended
in
ringlets
to
her
waist
her
figure
was
rather
below
than
above
the
middle
size
it
was
light
and
airy
as
that
of
an
hamadryad
her
bosom
was
carefully
veiled
her
dress
was
white
it
was
fastened
by
a
blue
sash
and
just
permitted
to
peep
out
from
under
it
a
little
foot
of
the
most
delicate
proportions
a
chaplet
of
large
grains
hung
upon
her
arm
and
her
face
was
covered
with
a
veil
of
thick
black
gauze
such
was
the
female
to
whom
the
youngest
of
the
cavaliers
now
offered
his
seat
while
the
other
thought
it
necessary
to
pay
the
same
attention
to
her
companion
the
old
lady
with
many
expressions
of
gratitude
but
without
much
difficulty
accepted
the
offer
and
seated
herself
the
young
one
followed
her
example
but
made
no
other
compliment
than
a
simple
and
graceful
reverence
don
lorenzo
such
was
the
cavalier's
name
whose
seat
she
had
accepted
placed
himself
near
her
but
first
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
friend's
ear
who
immediately
took
the
hint
and
endeavoured
to
draw
off
the
old
woman's
attention
from
her
lovely
charge
'you
are
doubtless
lately
arrived
at
madrid'
said
lorenzo
to
his
fair
neighbour
'it
is
impossible
that
such
charms
should
have
long
remained
unobserved
and
had
not
this
been
your
first
public
appearance
the
envy
of
the
women
and
adoration
of
the
men
would
have
rendered
you
already
sufficiently
remarkable'
he
paused
in
expectation
of
an
answer
as
his
speech
did
not
absolutely
require
one
the
lady
did
not
open
her
lips
after
a
few
moments
he
resumed
his
discourse
'am
i
wrong
in
supposing
you
to
be
a
stranger
to
madrid'
the
lady
hesitated
and
at
last
in
so
low
a
voice
as
to
be
scarcely
intelligible
she
made
shift
to
answer--'no
segnor'
'do
you
intend
making
a
stay
of
any
length'
'yes
segnor'
'i
should
esteem
myself
fortunate
were
it
in
my
power
to
contribute
to
making
your
abode
agreeable
i
am
well
known
at
madrid
and
my
family
has
some
interest
at
court
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
you
cannot
honour
or
oblige
me
more
than
by
permitting
me
to
be
of
use
to
you'--'surely'
said
he
to
himself
'she
cannot
answer
that
by
a
monosyllable
now
she
must
say
something
to
me'
lorenzo
was
deceived
for
the
lady
answered
only
by
a
bow
by
this
time
he
had
discovered
that
his
neighbour
was
not
very
conversible
but
whether
her
silence
proceeded
from
pride
discretion
timidity
or
idiotism
he
was
still
unable
to
decide
after
a
pause
of
some
minutes--'it
is
certainly
from
your
being
a
stranger'
said
he
'and
as
yet
unacquainted
with
our
customs
that
you
continue
to
wear
your
veil
permit
me
to
remove
it'
at
the
same
time
he
advanced
his
hand
towards
the
gauze
the
lady
raised
hers
to
prevent
him
'i
never
unveil
in
public
segnor'
'and
where
is
the
harm
i
pray
you'
interrupted
her
companion
somewhat
sharply
'do
not
you
see
that
the
other
ladies
have
all
laid
their
veils
aside
to
do
honour
no
doubt
to
the
holy
place
in
which
we
are
i
have
taken
off
mine
already
and
surely
if
i
expose
my
features
to
general
observation
you
have
no
cause
to
put
yourself
in
such
a
wonderful
alarm
blessed
maria
here
is
a
fuss
and
a
bustle
about
a
chit's
face
come
come
child
uncover
it
i
warrant
you
that
nobody
will
run
away
with
it
from
you--'
'dear
aunt
it
is
not
the
custom
in
murcia'
'murcia
indeed
holy
st
barbara
what
does
that
signify
you
are
always
putting
me
in
mind
of
that
villainous
province
if
it
is
the
custom
in
madrid
that
is
all
that
we
ought
to
mind
and
therefore
i
desire
you
to
take
off
your
veil
immediately
obey
me
this
moment
antonia
for
you
know
that
i
cannot
bear
contradiction--'
her
niece
was
silent
but
made
no
further
opposition
to
don
lorenzo's
efforts
who
armed
with
the
aunt's
sanction
hastened
to
remove
the
gauze
what
a
seraph's
head
presented
itself
to
his
admiration
yet
it
was
rather
bewitching
than
beautiful
it
was
not
so
lovely
from
regularity
of
features
as
from
sweetness
and
sensibility
of
countenance
the
several
parts
of
her
face
considered
separately
many
of
them
were
far
from
handsome
but
when
examined
together
the
whole
was
adorable
her
skin
though
fair
was
not
entirely
without
freckles
her
eyes
were
not
very
large
nor
their
lashes
particularly
long
but
then
her
lips
were
of
the
most
rosy
freshness
her
fair
and
undulating
hair
confined
by
a
simple
ribband
poured
itself
below
her
waist
in
a
profusion
of
ringlets
her
throat
was
full
and
beautiful
in
the
extreme
her
hand
and
arm
were
formed
with
the
most
perfect
symmetry
her
mild
blue
eyes
seemed
an
heaven
of
sweetness
and
the
crystal
in
which
they
moved
sparkled
with
all
the
brilliance
of
diamonds
she
appeared
to
be
scarcely
fifteen
an
arch
smile
playing
round
her
mouth
declared
her
to
be
possessed
of
liveliness
which
excess
of
timidity
at
present
represt
she
looked
round
her
with
a
bashful
glance
and
whenever
her
eyes
accidentally
met
lorenzo's
she
dropt
them
hastily
upon
her
rosary
her
cheek
was
immediately
suffused
with
blushes
and
she
began
to
tell
her
beads
though
her
manner
evidently
showed
that
she
knew
not
what
she
was
about
lorenzo
gazed
upon
her
with
mingled
surprise
and
admiration
but
the
aunt
thought
it
necessary
to
apologize
for
antonia's
mauvaise
honte
''tis
a
young
creature'
said
she
'who
is
totally
ignorant
of
the
world
she
has
been
brought
up
in
an
old
castle
in
murcia
with
no
other
society
than
her
mother's
who
god
help
her
has
no
more
sense
good
soul
than
is
necessary
to
carry
her
soup
to
her
mouth
yet
she
is
my
own
sister
both
by
father
and
mother'
'and
has
so
little
sense'
said
don
christoval
with
feigned
astonishment
'how
very
extraordinary'
'very
true
segnor
is
it
not
strange
however
such
is
the
fact
and
yet
only
to
see
the
luck
of
some
people
a
young
nobleman
of
the
very
first
quality
took
it
into
his
head
that
elvira
had
some
pretensions
to
beauty--as
to
pretensions
in
truth
she
had
always
enough
of
them
but
as
to
beauty
if
i
had
only
taken
half
the
pains
to
set
myself
off
which
she
did
but
this
is
neither
here
nor
there
as
i
was
saying
segnor
a
young
nobleman
fell
in
love
with
her
and
married
her
unknown
to
his
father
their
union
remained
a
secret
near
three
years
but
at
last
it
came
to
the
ears
of
the
old
marquis
who
as
you
may
well
suppose
was
not
much
pleased
with
the
intelligence
away
he
posted
in
all
haste
to
cordova
determined
to
seize
elvira
and
send
her
away
to
some
place
or
other
where
she
would
never
be
heard
of
more
holy
st
paul
how
he
stormed
on
finding
that
she
had
escaped
him
had
joined
her
husband
and
that
they
had
embarked
together
for
the
indies
he
swore
at
us
all
as
if
the
evil
spirit
had
possessed
him
he
threw
my
father
into
prison
as
honest
a
painstaking
shoe-maker
as
any
in
cordova
and
when
he
went
away
he
had
the
cruelty
to
take
from
us
my
sister's
little
boy
then
scarcely
two
years
old
and
whom
in
the
abruptness
of
her
flight
she
had
been
obliged
to
leave
behind
her
i
suppose
that
the
poor
little
wretch
met
with
bitter
bad
treatment
from
him
for
in
a
few
months
after
we
received
intelligence
of
his
death'
'why
this
was
a
most
terrible
old
fellow
segnora'
'oh
shocking
and
a
man
so
totally
devoid
of
taste
why
would
you
believe
it
segnor
when
i
attempted
to
pacify
him
he
cursed
me
for
a
witch
and
wished
that
to
punish
the
count
my
sister
might
become
as
ugly
as
myself
ugly
indeed
i
like
him
for
that'
'ridiculous'
cried
don
christoval
'doubtless
the
count
would
have
thought
himself
fortunate
had
he
been
permitted
to
exchange
the
one
sister
for
the
other'
'oh
christ
segnor
you
are
really
too
polite
however
i
am
heartily
glad
that
the
conde
was
of
a
different
way
of
thinking
a
mighty
pretty
piece
of
business
to
be
sure
elvira
has
made
of
it
after
broiling
and
stewing
in
the
indies
for
thirteen
long
years
her
husband
dies
and
she
returns
to
spain
without
an
house
to
hide
her
head
or
money
to
procure
her
one
this
antonia
was
then
but
an
infant
and
her
only
remaining
child
she
found
that
her
father-in-law
had
married
again
that
he
was
irreconcileable
to
the
conde
and
that
his
second
wife
had
produced
him
a
son
who
is
reported
to
be
a
very
fine
young
man
the
old
marquis
refused
to
see
my
sister
or
her
child
but
sent
her
word
that
on
condition
of
never
hearing
any
more
of
her
he
would
assign
her
a
small
pension
and
she
might
live
in
an
old
castle
which
he
possessed
in
murcia
this
had
been
the
favourite
habitation
of
his
eldest
son
but
since
his
flight
from
spain
the
old
marquis
could
not
bear
the
place
but
let
it
fall
to
ruin
and
confusion--my
sister
accepted
the
proposal
she
retired
to
murcia
and
has
remained
there
till
within
the
last
month'
'and
what
brings
her
now
to
madrid'
enquired
don
lorenzo
whom
admiration
of
the
young
antonia
compelled
to
take
a
lively
interest
in
the
talkative
old
woman's
narration
'alas
segnor
her
father-in-law
being
lately
dead
the
steward
of
his
murcian
estates
has
refused
to
pay
her
pension
any
longer
with
the
design
of
supplicating
his
son
to
renew
it
she
is
now
come
to
madrid
but
i
doubt
that
she
might
have
saved
herself
the
trouble
you
young
noblemen
have
always
enough
to
do
with
your
money
and
are
not
very
often
disposed
to
throw
it
away
upon
old
women
i
advised
my
sister
to
send
antonia
with
her
petition
but
she
would
not
hear
of
such
a
thing
she
is
so
obstinate
well
she
will
find
herself
the
worse
for
not
following
my
counsels
the
girl
has
a
good
pretty
face
and
possibly
might
have
done
much'
'ah
segnora'
interrupted
don
christoval
counterfeiting
a
passionate
air
'if
a
pretty
face
will
do
the
business
why
has
not
your
sister
recourse
to
you'
'oh
jesus
my
lord
i
swear
you
quite
overpower
me
with
your
gallantry
but
i
promise
you
that
i
am
too
well
aware
of
the
danger
of
such
expeditions
to
trust
myself
in
a
young
nobleman's
power
no
no
i
have
as
yet
preserved
my
reputation
without
blemish
or
reproach
and
i
always
knew
how
to
keep
the
men
at
a
proper
distance'
'of
that
segnora
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
but
permit
me
to
ask
you
have
you
then
any
aversion
to
matrimony'
'that
is
an
home
question
i
cannot
but
confess
that
if
an
amiable
cavalier
was
to
present
himself'
here
she
intended
to
throw
a
tender
and
significant
look
upon
don
christoval
but
as
she
unluckily
happened
to
squint
most
abominably
the
glance
fell
directly
upon
his
companion
lorenzo
took
the
compliment
to
himself
and
answered
it
by
a
profound
bow
'may
i
enquire'
said
he
'the
name
of
the
marquis'
'the
marquis
de
las
cisternas'
'i
know
him
intimately
well
he
is
not
at
present
in
madrid
but
is
expected
here
daily
he
is
one
of
the
best
of
men
and
if
the
lovely
antonia
will
permit
me
to
be
her
advocate
with
him
i
doubt
not
my
being
able
to
make
a
favourable
report
of
her
cause'
antonia
raised
her
blue
eyes
and
silently
thanked
him
for
the
offer
by
a
smile
of
inexpressible
sweetness
leonella's
satisfaction
was
much
more
loud
and
audible
indeed
as
her
niece
was
generally
silent
in
her
company
she
thought
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
talk
enough
for
both
this
she
managed
without
difficulty
for
she
very
seldom
found
herself
deficient
in
words
'oh
segnor'
she
cried
'you
will
lay
our
whole
family
under
the
most
signal
obligations
i
accept
your
offer
with
all
possible
gratitude
and
return
you
a
thousand
thanks
for
the
generosity
of
your
proposal
antonia
why
do
not
you
speak
child
while
the
cavalier
says
all
sorts
of
civil
things
to
you
you
sit
like
a
statue
and
never
utter
a
syllable
of
thanks
either
bad
good
or
indifferent'
'my
dear
aunt
i
am
very
sensible
that'
'fye
niece
how
often
have
i
told
you
that
you
never
should
interrupt
a
person
who
is
speaking
when
did
you
ever
know
me
do
such
a
thing
are
these
your
murcian
manners
mercy
on
me
i
shall
never
be
able
to
make
this
girl
any
thing
like
a
person
of
good
breeding
but
pray
segnor'
she
continued
addressing
herself
to
don
christoval
'inform
me
why
such
a
crowd
is
assembled
today
in
this
cathedral'
'can
you
possibly
be
ignorant
that
ambrosio
abbot
of
this
monastery
pronounces
a
sermon
in
this
church
every
thursday
all
madrid
rings
with
his
praises
as
yet
he
has
preached
but
thrice
but
all
who
have
heard
him
are
so
delighted
with
his
eloquence
that
it
is
as
difficult
to
obtain
a
place
at
church
as
at
the
first
representation
of
a
new
comedy
his
fame
certainly
must
have
reached
your
ears--'
'alas
segnor
till
yesterday
i
never
had
the
good
fortune
to
see
madrid
and
at
cordova
we
are
so
little
informed
of
what
is
passing
in
the
rest
of
the
world
that
the
name
of
ambrosio
has
never
been
mentioned
in
its
precincts'
'you
will
find
it
in
every
one's
mouth
at
madrid
he
seems
to
have
fascinated
the
inhabitants
and
not
having
attended
his
sermons
myself
i
am
astonished
at
the
enthusiasm
which
he
has
excited
the
adoration
paid
him
both
by
young
and
old
by
man
and
woman
is
unexampled
the
grandees
load
him
with
presents
their
wives
refuse
to
have
any
other
confessor
and
he
is
known
through
all
the
city
by
the
name
of
the
man
of
holiness'
'undoubtedly
segnor
he
is
of
noble
origin--'
'that
point
still
remains
undecided
the
late
superior
of
the
capuchins
found
him
while
yet
an
infant
at
the
abbey
door
all
attempts
to
discover
who
had
left
him
there
were
vain
and
the
child
himself
could
give
no
account
of
his
parents
he
was
educated
in
the
monastery
where
he
has
remained
ever
since
he
early
showed
a
strong
inclination
for
study
and
retirement
and
as
soon
as
he
was
of
a
proper
age
he
pronounced
his
vows
no
one
has
ever
appeared
to
claim
him
or
clear
up
the
mystery
which
conceals
his
birth
and
the
monks
who
find
their
account
in
the
favour
which
is
shewn
to
their
establishment
from
respect
to
him
have
not
hesitated
to
publish
that
he
is
a
present
to
them
from
the
virgin
in
truth
the
singular
austerity
of
his
life
gives
some
countenance
to
the
report
he
is
now
thirty
years
old
every
hour
of
which
period
has
been
passed
in
study
total
seclusion
from
the
world
and
mortification
of
the
flesh
till
these
last
three
weeks
when
he
was
chosen
superior
of
the
society
to
which
he
belongs
he
had
never
been
on
the
outside
of
the
abbey
walls
even
now
he
never
quits
them
except
on
thursdays
when
he
delivers
a
discourse
in
this
cathedral
which
all
madrid
assembles
to
hear
his
knowledge
is
said
to
be
the
most
profound
his
eloquence
the
most
persuasive
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
he
has
never
been
known
to
transgress
a
single
rule
of
his
order
the
smallest
stain
is
not
to
be
discovered
upon
his
character
and
he
is
reported
to
be
so
strict
an
observer
of
chastity
that
he
knows
not
in
what
consists
the
difference
of
man
and
woman
the
common
people
therefore
esteem
him
to
be
a
saint'
'does
that
make
a
saint'
enquired
antonia
'bless
me
then
am
i
one'
'holy
st
barbara'
exclaimed
leonella
'what
a
question
fye
child
fye
these
are
not
fit
subjects
for
young
women
to
handle
you
should
not
seem
to
remember
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
man
in
the
world
and
you
ought
to
imagine
every
body
to
be
of
the
same
sex
with
yourself
i
should
like
to
see
you
give
people
to
understand
that
you
know
that
a
man
has
no
breasts
and
no
hips
and
no
'
luckily
for
antonia's
ignorance
which
her
aunt's
lecture
would
soon
have
dispelled
an
universal
murmur
through
the
church
announced
the
preacher's
arrival
donna
leonella
rose
from
her
seat
to
take
a
better
view
of
him
and
antonia
followed
her
example
he
was
a
man
of
noble
port
and
commanding
presence
his
stature
was
lofty
and
his
features
uncommonly
handsome
his
nose
was
aquiline
his
eyes
large
black
and
sparkling
and
his
dark
brows
almost
joined
together
his
complexion
was
of
a
deep
but
clear
brown
study
and
watching
had
entirely
deprived
his
cheek
of
colour
tranquillity
reigned
upon
his
smooth
unwrinkled
forehead
and
content
expressed
upon
every
feature
seemed
to
announce
the
man
equally
unacquainted
with
cares
and
crimes
he
bowed
himself
with
humility
to
the
audience
still
there
was
a
certain
severity
in
his
look
and
manner
that
inspired
universal
awe
and
few
could
sustain
the
glance
of
his
eye
at
once
fiery
and
penetrating
such
was
ambrosio
abbot
of
the
capuchins
and
surnamed
'the
man
of
holiness'
antonia
while
she
gazed
upon
him
eagerly
felt
a
pleasure
fluttering
in
her
bosom
which
till
then
had
been
unknown
to
her
and
for
which
she
in
vain
endeavoured
to
account
she
waited
with
impatience
till
the
sermon
should
begin
and
when
at
length
the
friar
spoke
the
sound
of
his
voice
seemed
to
penetrate
into
her
very
soul
though
no
other
of
the
spectators
felt
such
violent
sensations
as
did
the
young
antonia
yet
every
one
listened
with
interest
and
emotion
they
who
were
insensible
to
religion's
merits
were
still
enchanted
with
ambrosio's
oratory
all
found
their
attention
irresistibly
attracted
while
he
spoke
and
the
most
profound
silence
reigned
through
the
crowded
aisles
even
lorenzo
could
not
resist
the
charm
he
forgot
that
antonia
was
seated
near
him
and
listened
to
the
preacher
with
undivided
attention
in
language
nervous
clear
and
simple
the
monk
expatiated
on
the
beauties
of
religion
he
explained
some
abstruse
parts
of
the
sacred
writings
in
a
style
that
carried
with
it
universal
conviction
his
voice
at
once
distinct
and
deep
was
fraught
with
all
the
terrors
of
the
tempest
while
he
inveighed
against
the
vices
of
humanity
and
described
the
punishments
reserved
for
them
in
a
future
state
every
hearer
looked
back
upon
his
past
offences
and
trembled
the
thunder
seemed
to
roll
whose
bolt
was
destined
to
crush
him
and
the
abyss
of
eternal
destruction
to
open
before
his
feet
but
when
ambrosio
changing
his
theme
spoke
of
the
excellence
of
an
unsullied
conscience
of
the
glorious
prospect
which
eternity
presented
to
the
soul
untainted
with
reproach
and
of
the
recompense
which
awaited
it
in
the
regions
of
everlasting
glory
his
auditors
felt
their
scattered
spirits
insensibly
return
they
threw
themselves
with
confidence
upon
the
mercy
of
their
judge
they
hung
with
delight
upon
the
consoling
words
of
the
preacher
and
while
his
full
voice
swelled
into
melody
they
were
transported
to
those
happy
regions
which
he
painted
to
their
imaginations
in
colours
so
brilliant
and
glowing
the
discourse
was
of
considerable
length
yet
when
it
concluded
the
audience
grieved
that
it
had
not
lasted
longer
though
the
monk
had
ceased
to
speak
enthusiastic
silence
still
prevailed
through
the
church
at
length
the
charm
gradually
dissolving
the
general
admiration
was
expressed
in
audible
terms
as
ambrosio
descended
from
the
pulpit
his
auditors
crowded
round
him
loaded
him
with
blessings
threw
themselves
at
his
feet
and
kissed
the
hem
of
his
garment
he
passed
on
slowly
with
his
hands
crossed
devoutly
upon
his
bosom
to
the
door
opening
into
the
abbey
chapel
at
which
his
monks
waited
to
receive
him
he
ascended
the
steps
and
then
turning
towards
his
followers
addressed
to
them
a
few
words
of
gratitude
and
exhortation
while
he
spoke
his
rosary
composed
of
large
grains
of
amber
fell
from
his
hand
and
dropped
among
the
surrounding
multitude
it
was
seized
eagerly
and
immediately
divided
amidst
the
spectators
whoever
became
possessor
of
a
bead
preserved
it
as
a
sacred
relique
and
had
it
been
the
chaplet
of
thrice-blessed
st
francis
himself
it
could
not
have
been
disputed
with
greater
vivacity
the
abbot
smiling
at
their
eagerness
pronounced
his
benediction
and
quitted
the
church
while
humility
dwelt
upon
every
feature
dwelt
she
also
in
his
heart
antonia's
eyes
followed
him
with
anxiety
as
the
door
closed
after
him
it
seemed
to
her
as
had
she
lost
some
one
essential
to
her
happiness
a
tear
stole
in
silence
down
her
cheek
'he
is
separated
from
the
world'
said
she
to
herself
'perhaps
i
shall
never
see
him
more'
as
she
wiped
away
the
tear
lorenzo
observed
her
action
'are
you
satisfied
with
our
orator'
said
he
'or
do
you
think
that
madrid
overrates
his
talents'
antonia's
heart
was
so
filled
with
admiration
for
the
monk
that
she
eagerly
seized
the
opportunity
of
speaking
of
him
besides
as
she
now
no
longer
considered
lorenzo
as
an
absolute
stranger
she
was
less
embarrassed
by
her
excessive
timidity
'oh
he
far
exceeds
all
my
expectations'
answered
she
'till
this
moment
i
had
no
idea
of
the
powers
of
eloquence
but
when
he
spoke
his
voice
inspired
me
with
such
interest
such
esteem
i
might
almost
say
such
affection
for
him
that
i
am
myself
astonished
at
the
acuteness
of
my
feelings'
lorenzo
smiled
at
the
strength
of
her
expressions
'you
are
young
and
just
entering
into
life'
said
he
'your
heart
new
to
the
world
and
full
of
warmth
and
sensibility
receives
its
first
impressions
with
eagerness
artless
yourself
you
suspect
not
others
of
deceit
and
viewing
the
world
through
the
medium
of
your
own
truth
and
innocence
you
fancy
all
who
surround
you
to
deserve
your
confidence
and
esteem
what
pity
that
these
gay
visions
must
soon
be
dissipated
what
pity
that
you
must
soon
discover
the
baseness
of
mankind
and
guard
against
your
fellow-creatures
as
against
your
foes'
'alas
segnor'
replied
antonia
'the
misfortunes
of
my
parents
have
already
placed
before
me
but
too
many
sad
examples
of
the
perfidy
of
the
world
yet
surely
in
the
present
instance
the
warmth
of
sympathy
cannot
have
deceived
me'
'in
the
present
instance
i
allow
that
it
has
not
ambrosio's
character
is
perfectly
without
reproach
and
a
man
who
has
passed
the
whole
of
his
life
within
the
walls
of
a
convent
cannot
have
found
the
opportunity
to
be
guilty
even
were
he
possessed
of
the
inclination
but
now
when
obliged
by
the
duties
of
his
situation
he
must
enter
occasionally
into
the
world
and
be
thrown
into
the
way
of
temptation
it
is
now
that
it
behoves
him
to
show
the
brilliance
of
his
virtue
the
trial
is
dangerous
he
is
just
at
that
period
of
life
when
the
passions
are
most
vigorous
unbridled
and
despotic
his
established
reputation
will
mark
him
out
to
seduction
as
an
illustrious
victim
novelty
will
give
additional
charms
to
the
allurements
of
pleasure
and
even
the
talents
with
which
nature
has
endowed
him
will
contribute
to
his
ruin
by
facilitating
the
means
of
obtaining
his
object
very
few
would
return
victorious
from
a
contest
so
severe'
'ah
surely
ambrosio
will
be
one
of
those
few'
'of
that
i
have
myself
no
doubt
by
all
accounts
he
is
an
exception
to
mankind
in
general
and
envy
would
seek
in
vain
for
a
blot
upon
his
character'
'segnor
you
delight
me
by
this
assurance
it
encourages
me
to
indulge
my
prepossession
in
his
favour
and
you
know
not
with
what
pain
i
should
have
repressed
the
sentiment
ah
dearest
aunt
entreat
my
mother
to
choose
him
for
our
confessor'
'i
entreat
her'
replied
leonella
'i
promise
you
that
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
i
do
not
like
this
same
ambrosio
in
the
least
he
has
a
look
of
severity
about
him
that
made
me
tremble
from
head
to
foot
were
he
my
confessor
i
should
never
have
the
courage
to
avow
one
half
of
my
peccadilloes
and
then
i
should
be
in
a
rare
condition
i
never
saw
such
a
stern-looking
mortal
and
hope
that
i
never
shall
see
such
another
his
description
of
the
devil
god
bless
us
almost
terrified
me
out
of
my
wits
and
when
he
spoke
about
sinners
he
seemed
as
if
he
was
ready
to
eat
them'
'you
are
right
segnora'
answered
don
christoval
'too
great
severity
is
said
to
be
ambrosio's
only
fault
exempted
himself
from
human
failings
he
is
not
sufficiently
indulgent
to
those
of
others
and
though
strictly
just
and
disinterested
in
his
decisions
his
government
of
the
monks
has
already
shown
some
proofs
of
his
inflexibility
but
the
crowd
is
nearly
dissipated
will
you
permit
us
to
attend
you
home'
'oh
christ
segnor'
exclaimed
leonella
affecting
to
blush
'i
would
not
suffer
such
a
thing
for
the
universe
if
i
came
home
attended
by
so
gallant
a
cavalier
my
sister
is
so
scrupulous
that
she
would
read
me
an
hour's
lecture
and
i
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
besides
i
rather
wish
you
not
to
make
your
proposals
just
at
present'
'my
proposals
i
assure
you
segnora'
'oh
segnor
i
believe
that
your
assurances
of
impatience
are
all
very
true
but
really
i
must
desire
a
little
respite
it
would
not
be
quite
so
delicate
in
me
to
accept
your
hand
at
first
sight'
'accept
my
hand
as
i
hope
to
live
and
breathe'
'oh
dear
segnor
press
me
no
further
if
you
love
me
i
shall
consider
your
obedience
as
a
proof
of
your
affection
you
shall
hear
from
me
tomorrow
and
so
farewell
but
pray
cavaliers
may
i
not
enquire
your
names'
'my
friend's'
replied
lorenzo
'is
the
conde
d'ossorio
and
mine
lorenzo
de
medina'
''tis
sufficient
well
don
lorenzo
i
shall
acquaint
my
sister
with
your
obliging
offer
and
let
you
know
the
result
with
all
expedition
where
may
i
send
to
you'
'i
am
always
to
be
found
at
the
medina
palace'
'you
may
depend
upon
hearing
from
me
farewell
cavaliers
segnor
conde
let
me
entreat
you
to
moderate
the
excessive
ardour
of
your
passion
however
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
not
displeased
with
you
and
prevent
your
abandoning
yourself
to
despair
receive
this
mark
of
my
affection
and
sometimes
bestow
a
thought
upon
the
absent
leonella'
as
she
said
this
she
extended
a
lean
and
wrinkled
hand
which
her
supposed
admirer
kissed
with
such
sorry
grace
and
constraint
so
evident
that
lorenzo
with
difficulty
repressed
his
inclination
to
laugh
leonella
then
hastened
to
quit
the
church
the
lovely
antonia
followed
her
in
silence
but
when
she
reached
the
porch
she
turned
involuntarily
and
cast
back
her
eyes
towards
lorenzo
he
bowed
to
her
as
bidding
her
farewell
she
returned
the
compliment
and
hastily
withdrew
'so
lorenzo'
said
don
christoval
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
'you
have
procured
me
an
agreeable
intrigue
to
favour
your
designs
upon
antonia
i
obligingly
make
a
few
civil
speeches
which
mean
nothing
to
the
aunt
and
at
the
end
of
an
hour
i
find
myself
upon
the
brink
of
matrimony
how
will
you
reward
me
for
having
suffered
so
grievously
for
your
sake
what
can
repay
me
for
having
kissed
the
leathern
paw
of
that
confounded
old
witch
diavolo
she
has
left
such
a
scent
upon
my
lips
that
i
shall
smell
of
garlick
for
this
month
to
come
as
i
pass
along
the
prado
i
shall
be
taken
for
a
walking
omelet
or
some
large
onion
running
to
seed'
'i
confess
my
poor
count'
replied
lorenzo
'that
your
service
has
been
attended
with
danger
yet
am
i
so
far
from
supposing
it
be
past
all
endurance
that
i
shall
probably
solicit
you
to
carry
on
your
amours
still
further'
'from
that
petition
i
conclude
that
the
little
antonia
has
made
some
impression
upon
you'
'i
cannot
express
to
you
how
much
i
am
charmed
with
her
since
my
father's
death
my
uncle
the
duke
de
medina
has
signified
to
me
his
wishes
to
see
me
married
i
have
till
now
eluded
his
hints
and
refused
to
understand
them
but
what
i
have
seen
this
evening'
'well
what
have
you
seen
this
evening
why
surely
don
lorenzo
you
cannot
be
mad
enough
to
think
of
making
a
wife
out
of
this
grand-daughter
of
as
honest
a
painstaking
shoe-maker
as
any
in
cordova'
'you
forget
that
she
is
also
the
grand-daughter
of
the
late
marquis
de
las
cisternas
but
without
disputing
about
birth
and
titles
i
must
assure
you
that
i
never
beheld
a
woman
so
interesting
as
antonia'
'very
possibly
but
you
cannot
mean
to
marry
her'
'why
not
my
dear
conde
i
shall
have
wealth
enough
for
both
of
us
and
you
know
that
my
uncle
thinks
liberally
upon
the
subject
from
what
i
have
seen
of
raymond
de
las
cisternas
i
am
certain
that
he
will
readily
acknowledge
antonia
for
his
niece
her
birth
therefore
will
be
no
objection
to
my
offering
her
my
hand
i
should
be
a
villain
could
i
think
of
her
on
any
other
terms
than
marriage
and
in
truth
she
seems
possessed
of
every
quality
requisite
to
make
me
happy
in
a
wife
young
lovely
gentle
sensible'
'sensible
why
she
said
nothing
but
yes
and
no'
'she
did
not
say
much
more
i
must
confess--but
then
she
always
said
yes
or
no
in
the
right
place'
'did
she
so
oh
your
most
obedient
that
is
using
a
right
lover's
argument
and
i
dare
dispute
no
longer
with
so
profound
a
casuist
suppose
we
adjourn
to
the
comedy'
'it
is
out
of
my
power
i
only
arrived
last
night
at
madrid
and
have
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
my
sister
you
know
that
her
convent
is
in
this
street
and
i
was
going
thither
when
the
crowd
which
i
saw
thronging
into
this
church
excited
my
curiosity
to
know
what
was
the
matter
i
shall
now
pursue
my
first
intention
and
probably
pass
the
evening
with
my
sister
at
the
parlour
grate'
'your
sister
in
a
convent
say
you
oh
very
true
i
had
forgotten
and
how
does
donna
agnes
i
am
amazed
don
lorenzo
how
you
could
possibly
think
of
immuring
so
charming
a
girl
within
the
walls
of
a
cloister'
'i
think
of
it
don
christoval
how
can
you
suspect
me
of
such
barbarity
you
are
conscious
that
she
took
the
veil
by
her
own
desire
and
that
particular
circumstances
made
her
wish
for
a
seclusion
from
the
world
i
used
every
means
in
my
power
to
induce
her
to
change
her
resolution
the
endeavour
was
fruitless
and
i
lost
a
sister'
'the
luckier
fellow
you
i
think
lorenzo
you
were
a
considerable
gainer
by
that
loss
if
i
remember
right
donna
agnes
had
a
portion
of
ten
thousand
pistoles
half
of
which
reverted
to
your
lordship
by
st
jago
i
wish
that
i
had
fifty
sisters
in
the
same
predicament
i
should
consent
to
losing
them
every
soul
without
much
heart-burning--'
'how
conde'
said
lorenzo
in
an
angry
voice
'do
you
suppose
me
base
enough
to
have
influenced
my
sister's
retirement
do
you
suppose
that
the
despicable
wish
to
make
myself
master
of
her
fortune
could'
'admirable
courage
don
lorenzo
now
the
man
is
all
in
a
blaze
god
grant
that
antonia
may
soften
that
fiery
temper
or
we
shall
certainly
cut
each
other's
throat
before
the
month
is
over
however
to
prevent
such
a
tragical
catastrophe
for
the
present
i
shall
make
a
retreat
and
leave
you
master
of
the
field
farewell
my
knight
of
mount
aetna
moderate
that
inflammable
disposition
and
remember
that
whenever
it
is
necessary
to
make
love
to
yonder
harridan
you
may
reckon
upon
my
services'
he
said
and
darted
out
of
the
cathedral
'how
wild-brained'
said
lorenzo
'with
so
excellent
an
heart
what
pity
that
he
possesses
so
little
solidity
of
judgment'
the
night
was
now
fast
advancing
the
lamps
were
not
yet
lighted
the
faint
beams
of
the
rising
moon
scarcely
could
pierce
through
the
gothic
obscurity
of
the
church
lorenzo
found
himself
unable
to
quit
the
spot
the
void
left
in
his
bosom
by
antonia's
absence
and
his
sister's
sacrifice
which
don
christoval
had
just
recalled
to
his
imagination
created
that
melancholy
of
mind
which
accorded
but
too
well
with
the
religious
gloom
surrounding
him
he
was
still
leaning
against
the
seventh
column
from
the
pulpit
a
soft
and
cooling
air
breathed
along
the
solitary
aisles
the
moonbeams
darting
into
the
church
through
painted
windows
tinged
the
fretted
roofs
and
massy
pillars
with
a
thousand
various
tints
of
light
and
colours
universal
silence
prevailed
around
only
interrupted
by
the
occasional
closing
of
doors
in
the
adjoining
abbey
the
calm
of
the
hour
and
solitude
of
the
place
contributed
to
nourish
lorenzo's
disposition
to
melancholy
he
threw
himself
upon
a
seat
which
stood
near
him
and
abandoned
himself
to
the
delusions
of
his
fancy
he
thought
of
his
union
with
antonia
he
thought
of
the
obstacles
which
might
oppose
his
wishes
and
a
thousand
changing
visions
floated
before
his
fancy
sad
'tis
true
but
not
unpleasing
sleep
insensibly
stole
over
him
and
the
tranquil
solemnity
of
his
mind
when
awake
for
a
while
continued
to
influence
his
slumbers
he
still
fancied
himself
to
be
in
the
church
of
the
capuchins
but
it
was
no
longer
dark
and
solitary
multitudes
of
silver
lamps
shed
splendour
from
the
vaulted
roof
accompanied
by
the
captivating
chaunt
of
distant
choristers
the
organ's
melody
swelled
through
the
church
the
altar
seemed
decorated
as
for
some
distinguished
feast
it
was
surrounded
by
a
brilliant
company
and
near
it
stood
antonia
arrayed
in
bridal
white
and
blushing
with
all
the
charms
of
virgin
modesty
half
hoping
half
fearing
lorenzo
gazed
upon
the
scene
before
him
sudden
the
door
leading
to
the
abbey
unclosed
and
he
saw
attended
by
a
long
train
of
monks
the
preacher
advance
to
whom
he
had
just
listened
with
so
much
admiration
he
drew
near
antonia
'and
where
is
the
bridegroom'
said
the
imaginary
friar
antonia
seemed
to
look
round
the
church
with
anxiety
involuntarily
the
youth
advanced
a
few
steps
from
his
concealment
she
saw
him
the
blush
of
pleasure
glowed
upon
her
cheek
with
a
graceful
motion
of
her
hand
she
beckoned
to
him
to
advance
he
disobeyed
not
the
command
he
flew
towards
her
and
threw
himself
at
her
feet
she
retreated
for
a
moment
then
gazing
upon
him
with
unutterable
delight--'yes'
she
exclaimed
'my
bridegroom
my
destined
bridegroom'
she
said
and
hastened
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
but
before
he
had
time
to
receive
her
an
unknown
rushed
between
them
his
form
was
gigantic
his
complexion
was
swarthy
his
eyes
fierce
and
terrible
his
mouth
breathed
out
volumes
of
fire
and
on
his
forehead
was
written
in
legible
characters--'pride
lust
inhumanity'
antonia
shrieked
the
monster
clasped
her
in
his
arms
and
springing
with
her
upon
the
altar
tortured
her
with
his
odious
caresses
she
endeavoured
in
vain
to
escape
from
his
embrace
lorenzo
flew
to
her
succour
but
ere
he
had
time
to
reach
her
a
loud
burst
of
thunder
was
heard
instantly
the
cathedral
seemed
crumbling
into
pieces
the
monks
betook
themselves
to
flight
shrieking
fearfully
the
lamps
were
extinguished
the
altar
sank
down
and
in
its
place
appeared
an
abyss
vomiting
forth
clouds
of
flame
uttering
a
loud
and
terrible
cry
the
monster
plunged
into
the
gulph
and
in
his
fall
attempted
to
drag
antonia
with
him
he
strove
in
vain
animated
by
supernatural
powers
she
disengaged
herself
from
his
embrace
but
her
white
robe
was
left
in
his
possession
instantly
a
wing
of
brilliant
splendour
spread
itself
from
either
of
antonia's
arms
she
darted
upwards
and
while
ascending
cried
to
lorenzo
'friend
we
shall
meet
above'
at
the
same
moment
the
roof
of
the
cathedral
opened
harmonious
voices
pealed
along
the
vaults
and
the
glory
into
which
antonia
was
received
was
composed
of
rays
of
such
dazzling
brightness
that
lorenzo
was
unable
to
sustain
the
gaze
his
sight
failed
and
he
sank
upon
the
ground
when
he
woke
he
found
himself
extended
upon
the
pavement
of
the
church
it
was
illuminated
and
the
chaunt
of
hymns
sounded
from
a
distance
for
a
while
lorenzo
could
not
persuade
himself
that
what
he
had
just
witnessed
had
been
a
dream
so
strong
an
impression
had
it
made
upon
his
fancy
a
little
recollection
convinced
him
of
its
fallacy
the
lamps
had
been
lighted
during
his
sleep
and
the
music
which
he
heard
was
occasioned
by
the
monks
who
were
celebrating
their
vespers
in
the
abbey
chapel
lorenzo
rose
and
prepared
to
bend
his
steps
towards
his
sister's
convent
his
mind
fully
occupied
by
the
singularity
of
his
dream
he
already
drew
near
the
porch
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
perceiving
a
shadow
moving
upon
the
opposite
wall
he
looked
curiously
round
and
soon
descried
a
man
wrapped
up
in
his
cloak
who
seemed
carefully
examining
whether
his
actions
were
observed
very
few
people
are
exempt
from
the
influence
of
curiosity
the
unknown
seemed
anxious
to
conceal
his
business
in
the
cathedral
and
it
was
this
very
circumstance
which
made
lorenzo
wish
to
discover
what
he
was
about
our
hero
was
conscious
that
he
had
no
right
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
this
unknown
cavalier
'i
will
go'
said
lorenzo
and
lorenzo
stayed
where
he
was
the
shadow
thrown
by
the
column
effectually
concealed
him
from
the
stranger
who
continued
to
advance
with
caution
at
length
he
drew
a
letter
from
beneath
his
cloak
and
hastily
placed
it
beneath
a
colossal
statue
of
st
francis
then
retiring
with
precipitation
he
concealed
himself
in
a
part
of
the
church
at
a
considerable
distance
from
that
in
which
the
image
stood
'so'
said
lorenzo
to
himself
'this
is
only
some
foolish
love
affair
i
believe
i
may
as
well
be
gone
for
i
can
do
no
good
in
it'
in
truth
till
that
moment
it
never
came
into
his
head
that
he
could
do
any
good
in
it
but
he
thought
it
necessary
to
make
some
little
excuse
to
himself
for
having
indulged
his
curiosity
he
now
made
a
second
attempt
to
retire
from
the
church
for
this
time
he
gained
the
porch
without
meeting
with
any
impediment
but
it
was
destined
that
he
should
pay
it
another
visit
that
night
as
he
descended
the
steps
leading
into
the
street
a
cavalier
rushed
against
him
with
such
violence
that
both
were
nearly
overturned
by
the
concussion
lorenzo
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
'how
now
segnor'
said
he
'what
mean
you
by
this
rudeness'
'ha
is
it
you
medina'
replied
the
newcomer
whom
lorenzo
by
his
voice
now
recognized
for
don
christoval
'you
are
the
luckiest
fellow
in
the
universe
not
to
have
left
the
church
before
my
return
in
in
my
dear
lad
they
will
be
here
immediately'
'who
will
be
here'
'the
old
hen
and
all
her
pretty
little
chickens
in
i
say
and
then
you
shall
know
the
whole
history'
lorenzo
followed
him
into
the
cathedral
and
they
concealed
themselves
behind
the
statue
of
st
francis
'and
now'
said
our
hero
'may
i
take
the
liberty
of
asking
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
haste
and
rapture'
'oh
lorenzo
we
shall
see
such
a
glorious
sight
the
prioress
of
st
clare
and
her
whole
train
of
nuns
are
coming
hither
you
are
to
know
that
the
pious
father
ambrosio
the
lord
reward
him
for
it
will
upon
no
account
move
out
of
his
own
precincts
it
being
absolutely
necessary
for
every
fashionable
convent
to
have
him
for
its
confessor
the
nuns
are
in
consequence
obliged
to
visit
him
at
the
abbey
since
when
the
mountain
will
not
come
to
mahomet
mahomet
must
needs
go
to
the
mountain
now
the
prioress
of
st
clare
the
better
to
escape
the
gaze
of
such
impure
eyes
as
belong
to
yourself
and
your
humble
servant
thinks
proper
to
bring
her
holy
flock
to
confession
in
the
dusk
she
is
to
be
admitted
into
the
abbey
chapel
by
yon
private
door
the
porteress
of
st
clare
who
is
a
worthy
old
soul
and
a
particular
friend
of
mine
has
just
assured
me
of
their
being
here
in
a
few
moments
there
is
news
for
you
you
rogue
we
shall
see
some
of
the
prettiest
faces
in
madrid'
'in
truth
christoval
we
shall
do
no
such
thing
the
nuns
are
always
veiled'
'no
no
i
know
better
on
entering
a
place
of
worship
they
ever
take
off
their
veils
from
respect
to
the
saint
to
whom
'tis
dedicated
but
hark
they
are
coming
silence
silence
observe
and
be
convinced'
'good'
said
lorenzo
to
himself
'i
may
possibly
discover
to
whom
the
vows
are
addressed
of
this
mysterious
stranger'
scarcely
had
don
christoval
ceased
to
speak
when
the
domina
of
st
clare
appeared
followed
by
a
long
procession
of
nuns
each
upon
entering
the
church
took
off
her
veil
the
prioress
crossed
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
and
made
a
profound
reverence
as
she
passed
the
statue
of
st
francis
the
patron
of
this
cathedral
the
nuns
followed
her
example
and
several
moved
onwards
without
having
satisfied
lorenzo's
curiosity
he
almost
began
to
despair
of
seeing
the
mystery
cleared
up
when
in
paying
her
respects
to
st
francis
one
of
the
nuns
happened
to
drop
her
rosary
as
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
the
light
flashed
full
upon
her
face
at
the
same
moment
she
dexterously
removed
the
letter
from
beneath
the
image
placed
it
in
her
bosom
and
hastened
to
resume
her
rank
in
the
procession
'ha'
said
christoval
in
a
low
voice
'here
we
have
some
little
intrigue
no
doubt'
'agnes
by
heaven'
cried
lorenzo
'what
your
sister
diavolo
then
somebody
i
suppose
will
have
to
pay
for
our
peeping'
'and
shall
pay
for
it
without
delay'
replied
the
incensed
brother
the
pious
procession
had
now
entered
the
abbey
the
door
was
already
closed
upon
it
the
unknown
immediately
quitted
his
concealment
and
hastened
to
leave
the
church
ere
he
could
effect
his
intention
he
descried
medina
stationed
in
his
passage
the
stranger
hastily
retreated
and
drew
his
hat
over
his
eyes
'attempt
not
to
fly
me'
exclaimed
lorenzo
'i
will
know
who
you
are
and
what
were
the
contents
of
that
letter'
'of
that
letter'
repeated
the
unknown
'and
by
what
title
do
you
ask
the
question'
'by
a
title
of
which
i
am
now
ashamed
but
it
becomes
not
you
to
question
me
either
reply
circumstantially
to
my
demands
or
answer
me
with
your
sword'
'the
latter
method
will
be
the
shortest'
rejoined
the
other
drawing
his
rapier
'come
on
segnor
bravo
i
am
ready'
burning
with
rage
lorenzo
hastened
to
the
attack
the
antagonists
had
already
exchanged
several
passes
before
christoval
who
at
that
moment
had
more
sense
than
either
of
them
could
throw
himself
between
their
weapons
'hold
hold
medina'
he
exclaimed
'remember
the
consequences
of
shedding
blood
on
consecrated
ground'
the
stranger
immediately
dropped
his
sword
'medina'
he
cried
'great
god
is
it
possible
lorenzo
have
you
quite
forgotten
raymond
de
las
cisternas'
lorenzo's
astonishment
increased
with
every
succeeding
moment
raymond
advanced
towards
him
but
with
a
look
of
suspicion
he
drew
back
his
hand
which
the
other
was
preparing
to
take
'you
here
marquis
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
you
engaged
in
a
clandestine
correspondence
with
my
sister
whose
affections'
'have
ever
been
and
still
are
mine
but
this
is
no
fit
place
for
an
explanation
accompany
me
to
my
hotel
and
you
shall
know
every
thing
who
is
that
with
you'
'one
whom
i
believe
you
to
have
seen
before'
replied
don
christoval
'though
probably
not
at
church'
'the
conde
d'ossorio'
'exactly
so
marquis'
'i
have
no
objection
to
entrusting
you
with
my
secret
for
i
am
sure
that
i
may
depend
upon
your
silence'
'then
your
opinion
of
me
is
better
than
my
own
and
therefore
i
must
beg
leave
to
decline
your
confidence
do
you
go
your
own
way
and
i
shall
go
mine
marquis
where
are
you
to
be
found'
'as
usual
at
the
hotel
de
las
cisternas
but
remember
that
i
am
incognito
and
that
if
you
wish
to
see
me
you
must
ask
for
alphonso
d'alvarada'
'good
good
farewell
cavaliers'
said
don
christoval
and
instantly
departed
'you
marquis'
said
lorenzo
in
the
accent
of
surprise
'you
alphonso
d'alvarada'
'even
so
lorenzo
but
unless
you
have
already
heard
my
story
from
your
sister
i
have
much
to
relate
that
will
astonish
you
follow
me
therefore
to
my
hotel
without
delay'
at
this
moment
the
porter
of
the
capuchins
entered
the
cathedral
to
lock
up
the
doors
for
the
night
the
two
noblemen
instantly
withdrew
and
hastened
with
all
speed
to
the
palace
de
las
cisternas
'well
antonia'
said
the
aunt
as
soon
as
she
had
quitted
the
church
'what
think
you
of
our
gallants
don
lorenzo
really
seems
a
very
obliging
good
sort
of
young
man
he
paid
you
some
attention
and
nobody
knows
what
may
come
of
it
but
as
to
don
christoval
i
protest
to
you
he
is
the
very
phoenix
of
politeness
so
gallant
so
well-bred
so
sensible
and
so
pathetic
well
if
ever
man
can
prevail
upon
me
to
break
my
vow
never
to
marry
it
will
be
that
don
christoval
you
see
niece
that
every
thing
turns
out
exactly
as
i
told
you
the
very
moment
that
i
produced
myself
in
madrid
i
knew
that
i
should
be
surrounded
by
admirers
when
i
took
off
my
veil
did
you
see
antonia
what
an
effect
the
action
had
upon
the
conde
and
when
i
presented
him
my
hand
did
you
observe
the
air
of
passion
with
which
he
kissed
it
if
ever
i
witnessed
real
love
i
then
saw
it
impressed
upon
don
christoval's
countenance'
now
antonia
had
observed
the
air
with
which
don
christoval
had
kissed
this
same
hand
but
as
she
drew
conclusions
from
it
somewhat
different
from
her
aunt's
she
was
wise
enough
to
hold
her
tongue
as
this
is
the
only
instance
known
of
a
woman's
ever
having
done
so
it
was
judged
worthy
to
be
recorded
here
the
old
lady
continued
her
discourse
to
antonia
in
the
same
strain
till
they
gained
the
street
in
which
was
their
lodging
here
a
crowd
collected
before
their
door
permitted
them
not
to
approach
it
and
placing
themselves
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
they
endeavoured
to
make
out
what
had
drawn
all
these
people
together
after
some
minutes
the
crowd
formed
itself
into
a
circle
and
now
antonia
perceived
in
the
midst
of
it
a
woman
of
extraordinary
height
who
whirled
herself
repeatedly
round
and
round
using
all
sorts
of
extravagant
gestures
her
dress
was
composed
of
shreds
of
various-coloured
silks
and
linens
fantastically
arranged
yet
not
entirely
without
taste
her
head
was
covered
with
a
kind
of
turban
ornamented
with
vine
leaves
and
wild
flowers
she
seemed
much
sun-burnt
and
her
complexion
was
of
a
deep
olive
her
eyes
looked
fiery
and
strange
and
in
her
hand
she
bore
a
long
black
rod
with
which
she
at
intervals
traced
a
variety
of
singular
figures
upon
the
ground
round
about
which
she
danced
in
all
the
eccentric
attitudes
of
folly
and
delirium
suddenly
she
broke
off
her
dance
whirled
herself
round
thrice
with
rapidity
and
after
a
moment's
pause
she
sang
the
following
ballad
the
gypsy's
song
come
cross
my
hand
my
art
surpasses
all
that
did
ever
mortal
know
come
maidens
come
my
magic
glasses
your
future
husband's
form
can
show
for
'tis
to
me
the
power
is
given
unclosed
the
book
of
fate
to
see
to
read
the
fixed
resolves
of
heaven
and
dive
into
futurity
i
guide
the
pale
moon's
silver
waggon
the
winds
in
magic
bonds
i
hold
i
charm
to
sleep
the
crimson
dragon
who
loves
to
watch
o'er
buried
gold
fenced
round
with
spells
unhurt
i
venture
their
sabbath
strange
where
witches
keep
fearless
the
sorcerer's
circle
enter
and
woundless
tread
on
snakes
asleep
lo
here
are
charms
of
mighty
power
this
makes
secure
an
husband's
truth
and
this
composed
at
midnight
hour
will
force
to
love
the
coldest
youth
if
any
maid
too
much
has
granted
her
loss
this
philtre
will
repair
this
blooms
a
cheek
where
red
is
wanted
and
this
will
make
a
brown
girl
fair
then
silent
hear
while
i
discover
what
i
in
fortune's
mirror
view
and
each
when
many
a
year
is
over
shall
own
the
gypsy's
sayings
true
'dear
aunt'
said
antonia
when
the
stranger
had
finished
'is
she
not
mad'
'mad
not
she
child
she
is
only
wicked
she
is
a
gypsy
a
sort
of
vagabond
whose
sole
occupation
is
to
run
about
the
country
telling
lyes
and
pilfering
from
those
who
come
by
their
money
honestly
out
upon
such
vermin
if
i
were
king
of
spain
every
one
of
them
should
be
burnt
alive
who
was
found
in
my
dominions
after
the
next
three
weeks'
these
words
were
pronounced
so
audibly
that
they
reached
the
gypsy's
ears
she
immediately
pierced
through
the
crowd
and
made
towards
the
ladies
she
saluted
them
thrice
in
the
eastern
fashion
and
then
addressed
herself
to
antonia
the
gypsy
'lady
gentle
lady
know
i
your
future
fate
can
show
give
your
hand
and
do
not
fear
lady
gentle
lady
hear'
'dearest
aunt'
said
antonia
'indulge
me
this
once
let
me
have
my
fortune
told
me'
'nonsense
child
she
will
tell
you
nothing
but
falsehoods'
'no
matter
let
me
at
least
hear
what
she
has
to
say
do
my
dear
aunt
oblige
me
i
beseech
you'
'well
well
antonia
since
you
are
so
bent
upon
the
thing

here
good
woman
you
shall
see
the
hands
of
both
of
us
there
is
money
for
you
and
now
let
me
hear
my
fortune'
as
she
said
this
she
drew
off
her
glove
and
presented
her
hand
the
gypsy
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
and
then
made
this
reply
the
gypsy
'your
fortune
you
are
now
so
old
good
dame
that
'tis
already
told
yet
for
your
money
in
a
trice
i
will
repay
you
in
advice
astonished
at
your
childish
vanity
your
friends
all
tax
you
with
insanity
and
grieve
to
see
you
use
your
art
to
catch
some
youthful
lover's
heart
believe
me
dame
when
all
is
done
your
age
will
still
be
fifty
one
and
men
will
rarely
take
an
hint
of
love
from
two
grey
eyes
that
squint
take
then
my
counsels
lay
aside
your
paint
and
patches
lust
and
pride
and
on
the
poor
those
sums
bestow
which
now
are
spent
on
useless
show
think
on
your
maker
not
a
suitor
think
on
your
past
faults
not
on
future
and
think
time's
scythe
will
quickly
mow
the
few
red
hairs
which
deck
your
brow
the
audience
rang
with
laughter
during
the
gypsy's
address
and--'fifty
one'--'squinting
eyes'
'red
hair'--'paint
and
patches'
c
were
bandied
from
mouth
to
mouth
leonella
was
almost
choaked
with
passion
and
loaded
her
malicious
adviser
with
the
bitterest
reproaches
the
swarthy
prophetess
for
some
time
listened
to
her
with
a
contemptuous
smile
at
length
she
made
her
a
short
answer
and
then
turned
to
antonia
the
gypsy
'peace
lady
what
i
said
was
true
and
now
my
lovely
maid
to
you
give
me
your
hand
and
let
me
see
your
future
doom
and
heaven's
decree'
in
imitation
of
leonella
antonia
drew
off
her
glove
and
presented
her
white
hand
to
the
gypsy
who
having
gazed
upon
it
for
some
time
with
a
mingled
expression
of
pity
and
astonishment
pronounced
her
oracle
in
the
following
words
the
gypsy
'jesus
what
a
palm
is
there
chaste
and
gentle
young
and
fair
perfect
mind
and
form
possessing
you
would
be
some
good
man's
blessing
but
alas
this
line
discovers
that
destruction
o'er
you
hovers
lustful
man
and
crafty
devil
will
combine
to
work
your
evil
and
from
earth
by
sorrows
driven
soon
your
soul
must
speed
to
heaven
yet
your
sufferings
to
delay
well
remember
what
i
say
when
you
one
more
virtuous
see
than
belongs
to
man
to
be
one
whose
self
no
crimes
assailing
pities
not
his
neighbour's
failing
call
the
gypsy's
words
to
mind
though
he
seem
so
good
and
kind
fair
exteriors
oft
will
hide
hearts
that
swell
with
lust
and
pride
lovely
maid
with
tears
i
leave
you
let
not
my
prediction
grieve
you
rather
with
submission
bending
calmly
wait
distress
impending
and
expect
eternal
bliss
in
a
better
world
than
this
having
said
this
the
gypsy
again
whirled
herself
round
thrice
and
then
hastened
out
of
the
street
with
frantic
gesture
the
crowd
followed
her
and
elvira's
door
being
now
unembarrassed
leonella
entered
the
house
out
of
honour
with
the
gypsy
with
her
niece
and
with
the
people
in
short
with
every
body
but
herself
and
her
charming
cavalier
the
gypsy's
predictions
had
also
considerably
affected
antonia
but
the
impression
soon
wore
off
and
in
a
few
hours
she
had
forgotten
the
adventure
as
totally
as
had
it
never
taken
place
forse
se
tu
gustassi
una
sol
volta
la
millesima
parte
delle
gioje
che
gusta
un
cor
amato
riamando
diresti
ripentita
sospirando
perduto
e
tutto
il
tempo
che
in
amar
non
si
sponde
tasso
hadst
thou
but
tasted
once
the
thousandth
part
of
joys
which
bless
the
loved
and
loving
heart
your
words
repentant
and
your
sighs
would
prove
lost
is
the
time
which
is
not
past
in
love
the
monks
having
attended
their
abbot
to
the
door
of
his
cell
he
dismissed
them
with
an
air
of
conscious
superiority
in
which
humility's
semblance
combated
with
the
reality
of
pride
he
was
no
sooner
alone
than
he
gave
free
loose
to
the
indulgence
of
his
vanity
when
he
remembered
the
enthusiasm
which
his
discourse
had
excited
his
heart
swelled
with
rapture
and
his
imagination
presented
him
with
splendid
visions
of
aggrandizement
he
looked
round
him
with
exultation
and
pride
told
him
loudly
that
he
was
superior
to
the
rest
of
his
fellow-creatures
'who'
thought
he
'who
but
myself
has
passed
the
ordeal
of
youth
yet
sees
no
single
stain
upon
his
conscience
who
else
has
subdued
the
violence
of
strong
passions
and
an
impetuous
temperament
and
submitted
even
from
the
dawn
of
life
to
voluntary
retirement
i
seek
for
such
a
man
in
vain
i
see
no
one
but
myself
possessed
of
such
resolution
religion
cannot
boast
ambrosio's
equal
how
powerful
an
effect
did
my
discourse
produce
upon
its
auditors
how
they
crowded
round
me
how
they
loaded
me
with
benedictions
and
pronounced
me
the
sole
uncorrupted
pillar
of
the
church
what
then
now
is
left
for
me
to
do
nothing
but
to
watch
as
carefully
over
the
conduct
of
my
brothers
as
i
have
hitherto
watched
over
my
own
yet
hold
may
i
not
be
tempted
from
those
paths
which
till
now
i
have
pursued
without
one
moment's
wandering
am
i
not
a
man
whose
nature
is
frail
and
prone
to
error
i
must
now
abandon
the
solitude
of
my
retreat
the
fairest
and
noblest
dames
of
madrid
continually
present
themselves
at
the
abbey
and
will
use
no
other
confessor
i
must
accustom
my
eyes
to
objects
of
temptation
and
expose
myself
to
the
seduction
of
luxury
and
desire
should
i
meet
in
that
world
which
i
am
constrained
to
enter
some
lovely
female
lovely

as
you
madona'
as
he
said
this
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
a
picture
of
the
virgin
which
was
suspended
opposite
to
him
this
for
two
years
had
been
the
object
of
his
increasing
wonder
and
adoration
he
paused
and
gazed
upon
it
with
delight
'what
beauty
in
that
countenance'
he
continued
after
a
silence
of
some
minutes
'how
graceful
is
the
turn
of
that
head
what
sweetness
yet
what
majesty
in
her
divine
eyes
how
softly
her
cheek
reclines
upon
her
hand
can
the
rose
vie
with
the
blush
of
that
cheek
can
the
lily
rival
the
whiteness
of
that
hand
oh
if
such
a
creature
existed
and
existed
but
for
me
were
i
permitted
to
twine
round
my
fingers
those
golden
ringlets
and
press
with
my
lips
the
treasures
of
that
snowy
bosom
gracious
god
should
i
then
resist
the
temptation
should
i
not
barter
for
a
single
embrace
the
reward
of
my
sufferings
for
thirty
years
should
i
not
abandon
fool
that
i
am
whither
do
i
suffer
my
admiration
of
this
picture
to
hurry
me
away
impure
ideas
let
me
remember
that
woman
is
for
ever
lost
to
me
never
was
mortal
formed
so
perfect
as
this
picture
but
even
did
such
exist
the
trial
might
be
too
mighty
for
a
common
virtue
but
ambrosio's
is
proof
against
temptation
temptation
did
i
say
to
me
it
would
be
none
what
charms
me
when
ideal
and
considered
as
a
superior
being
would
disgust
me
become
woman
and
tainted
with
all
the
failings
of
mortality
it
is
not
the
woman's
beauty
that
fills
me
with
such
enthusiasm
it
is
the
painter's
skill
that
i
admire
it
is
the
divinity
that
i
adore
are
not
the
passions
dead
in
my
bosom
have
i
not
freed
myself
from
the
frailty
of
mankind
fear
not
ambrosio
take
confidence
in
the
strength
of
your
virtue
enter
boldly
into
a
world
to
whose
failings
you
are
superior
reflect
that
you
are
now
exempted
from
humanity's
defects
and
defy
all
the
arts
of
the
spirits
of
darkness
they
shall
know
you
for
what
you
are'
here
his
reverie
was
interrupted
by
three
soft
knocks
at
the
door
of
his
cell
with
difficulty
did
the
abbot
awake
from
his
delirium
the
knocking
was
repeated
'who
is
there'
said
ambrosio
at
length
'it
is
only
rosario'
replied
a
gentle
voice
'enter
enter
my
son'
the
door
was
immediately
opened
and
rosario
appeared
with
a
small
basket
in
his
hand
rosario
was
a
young
novice
belonging
to
the
monastery
who
in
three
months
intended
to
make
his
profession
a
sort
of
mystery
enveloped
this
youth
which
rendered
him
at
once
an
object
of
interest
and
curiosity
his
hatred
of
society
his
profound
melancholy
his
rigid
observation
of
the
duties
of
his
order
and
his
voluntary
seclusion
from
the
world
at
his
age
so
unusual
attracted
the
notice
of
the
whole
fraternity
he
seemed
fearful
of
being
recognised
and
no
one
had
ever
seen
his
face
his
head
was
continually
muffled
up
in
his
cowl
yet
such
of
his
features
as
accident
discovered
appeared
the
most
beautiful
and
noble
rosario
was
the
only
name
by
which
he
was
known
in
the
monastery
no
one
knew
from
whence
he
came
and
when
questioned
in
the
subject
he
preserved
a
profound
silence
a
stranger
whose
rich
habit
and
magnificent
equipage
declared
him
to
be
of
distinguished
rank
had
engaged
the
monks
to
receive
a
novice
and
had
deposited
the
necessary
sums
the
next
day
he
returned
with
rosario
and
from
that
time
no
more
had
been
heard
of
him
the
youth
had
carefully
avoided
the
company
of
the
monks
he
answered
their
civilities
with
sweetness
but
reserve
and
evidently
showed
that
his
inclination
led
him
to
solitude
to
this
general
rule
the
superior
was
the
only
exception
to
him
he
looked
up
with
a
respect
approaching
idolatry
he
sought
his
company
with
the
most
attentive
assiduity
and
eagerly
seized
every
means
to
ingratiate
himself
in
his
favour
in
the
abbot's
society
his
heart
seemed
to
be
at
ease
and
an
air
of
gaiety
pervaded
his
whole
manners
and
discourse
ambrosio
on
his
side
did
not
feel
less
attracted
towards
the
youth
with
him
alone
did
he
lay
aside
his
habitual
severity
when
he
spoke
to
him
he
insensibly
assumed
a
tone
milder
than
was
usual
to
him
and
no
voice
sounded
so
sweet
to
him
as
did
rosario's
he
repayed
the
youth's
attentions
by
instructing
him
in
various
sciences
the
novice
received
his
lessons
with
docility
ambrosio
was
every
day
more
charmed
with
the
vivacity
of
his
genius
the
simplicity
of
his
manners
and
the
rectitude
of
his
heart
in
short
he
loved
him
with
all
the
affection
of
a
father
he
could
not
help
sometimes
indulging
a
desire
secretly
to
see
the
face
of
his
pupil
but
his
rule
of
self-denial
extended
even
to
curiosity
and
prevented
him
from
communicating
his
wishes
to
the
youth
'pardon
my
intrusion
father'
said
rosario
while
he
placed
his
basket
upon
the
table
'i
come
to
you
a
suppliant
hearing
that
a
dear
friend
is
dangerously
ill
i
entreat
your
prayers
for
his
recovery
if
supplications
can
prevail
upon
heaven
to
spare
him
surely
yours
must
be
efficacious'
'whatever
depends
upon
me
my
son
you
know
that
you
may
command
what
is
your
friend's
name'
'vincentio
della
ronda'
''tis
sufficient
i
will
not
forget
him
in
my
prayers
and
may
our
thrice-blessed
st
francis
deign
to
listen
to
my
intercession--what
have
you
in
your
basket
rosario'
'a
few
of
those
flowers
reverend
father
which
i
have
observed
to
be
most
acceptable
to
you
will
you
permit
my
arranging
them
in
your
chamber'
'your
attentions
charm
me
my
son'
while
rosario
dispersed
the
contents
of
his
basket
in
small
vases
placed
for
that
purpose
in
various
parts
of
the
room
the
abbot
thus
continued
the
conversation
'i
saw
you
not
in
the
church
this
evening
rosario'
'yet
i
was
present
father
i
am
too
grateful
for
your
protection
to
lose
an
opportunity
of
witnessing
your
triumph'
'alas
rosario
i
have
but
little
cause
to
triumph
the
saint
spoke
by
my
mouth
to
him
belongs
all
the
merit
it
seems
then
you
were
contented
with
my
discourse'
'contented
say
you
oh
you
surpassed
yourself
never
did
i
hear
such
eloquence

save
once'
here
the
novice
heaved
an
involuntary
sigh
'when
was
that
once'
demanded
the
abbot
'when
you
preached
upon
the
sudden
indisposition
of
our
late
superior'
'i
remember
it
that
is
more
than
two
years
ago
and
were
you
present
i
knew
you
not
at
that
time
rosario'
''tis
true
father
and
would
to
god
i
had
expired
ere
i
beheld
that
day
what
sufferings
what
sorrows
should
i
have
escaped'
'sufferings
at
your
age
rosario'
'aye
father
sufferings
which
if
known
to
you
would
equally
raise
your
anger
and
compassion
sufferings
which
form
at
once
the
torment
and
pleasure
of
my
existence
yet
in
this
retreat
my
bosom
would
feel
tranquil
were
it
not
for
the
tortures
of
apprehension
oh
god
oh
god
how
cruel
is
a
life
of
fear--father
i
have
given
up
all
i
have
abandoned
the
world
and
its
delights
for
ever
nothing
now
remains
nothing
now
has
charms
for
me
but
your
friendship
but
your
affection
if
i
lose
that
father
oh
if
i
lose
that
tremble
at
the
effects
of
my
despair'
'you
apprehend

loss

has
my

justified
this
fear

better
rosario
and
think

worthy
of
your

what
are

reveal
them
to
me
and
believe
that
if
'tis
in

'ah
'tis
in
no

power

yours
yet
i
must
not

would
hate
me
for

from

with
scorn
and
ignominy'
'my

'for

no
further
i
must
not

i
dare
not
hark
the
bell

for

father
your
benediction
and
i
leave
you'
as
he
said
this
he
threw
himself
upon
his
knees
and
received
the
blessing
which
he
demanded
then
pressing
the
abbot's
hand
to
his
lips
he
started
from
the
ground
and
hastily
quitted
the
apartment
soon
after
ambrosio
descended
to
vespers
which
were
celebrated
in
a
small
chapel
belonging
to
the
abbey
filled
with
surprise
at
the
singularity
of
the
youth's
behaviour
vespers
being
over
the
monks
retired
to
their
respective
cells
the
abbot
alone
remained
in
the
chapel
to
receive
the
nuns
of
st
clare
he
had
not
been
long
seated
in
the
confessional
chair
before
the
prioress
made
her
appearance
each
of
the
nuns
was
heard
in
her
turn
while
the
others
waited
with
the
domina
in
the
adjoining
vestry
ambrosio
listened
to
the
confessions
with
attention
made
many
exhortations
enjoined
penance
proportioned
to
each
offence
and
for
some
time
every
thing
went
on
as
usual
till
at
last
one
of
the
nuns
conspicuous
from
the
nobleness
of
her
air
and
elegance
of
her
figure
carelessly
permitted
a
letter
to
fall
from
her
bosom
she
was
retiring
unconscious
of
her
loss
ambrosio
supposed
it
to
have
been
written
by
some
one
of
her
relations
and
picked
it
up
intending
to
restore
it
to
her
'stay
daughter'
said
he
'you
have
let
fall'
at
this
moment
the
paper
being
already
open
his
eye
involuntarily
read
the
first
words
he
started
back
with
surprise
the
nun
had
turned
round
on
hearing
his
voice
she
perceived
her
letter
in
his
hand
and
uttering
a
shriek
of
terror
flew
hastily
to
regain
it
'hold'
said
the
friar
in
a
tone
of
severity
'daughter
i
must
read
this
letter'
'then
i
am
lost'
she
exclaimed
clasping
her
hands
together
wildly
all
colour
instantly
faded
from
her
face
she
trembled
with
agitation
and
was
obliged
to
fold
her
arms
round
a
pillar
of
the
chapel
to
save
herself
from
sinking
upon
the
floor
in
the
meanwhile
the
abbot
read
the
following
lines
'all
is
ready
for
your
escape
my
dearest
agnes
at
twelve
tomorrow
night
i
shall
expect
to
find
you
at
the
garden
door
i
have
obtained
the
key
and
a
few
hours
will
suffice
to
place
you
in
a
secure
asylum
let
no
mistaken
scruples
induce
you
to
reject
the
certain
means
of
preserving
yourself
and
the
innocent
creature
whom
you
nourish
in
your
bosom
remember
that
you
had
promised
to
be
mine
long
ere
you
engaged
yourself
to
the
church
that
your
situation
will
soon
be
evident
to
the
prying
eyes
of
your
companions
and
that
flight
is
the
only
means
of
avoiding
the
effects
of
their
malevolent
resentment
farewell
my
agnes
my
dear
and
destined
wife
fail
not
to
be
at
the
garden
door
at
twelve'
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
ambrosio
bent
an
eye
stern
and
angry
upon
the
imprudent
nun
'this
letter
must
to
the
prioress'
said
he
and
passed
her
his
words
sounded
like
thunder
to
her
ears
she
awoke
from
her
torpidity
only
to
be
sensible
of
the
dangers
of
her
situation
she
followed
him
hastily
and
detained
him
by
his
garment
'stay
oh
stay'
she
cried
in
the
accents
of
despair
while
she
threw
herself
at
the
friar's
feet
and
bathed
them
with
her
tears
'father
compassionate
my
youth
look
with
indulgence
on
a
woman's
weakness
and
deign
to
conceal
my
frailty
the
remainder
of
my
life
shall
be
employed
in
expiating
this
single
fault
and
your
lenity
will
bring
back
a
soul
to
heaven'
'amazing
confidence
what
shall
st
clare's
convent
become

retreat
of
prostitutes
shall
i
suffer
the
church
of

to
cherish
in
its
bosom
debauchery
and
shame

lenity

make
me
your

abandoned
yourself
to

seducer's

have
defiled

your
impurity
and
still
dare
you
think
yourself
deserving
my
compassion
hence
nor
detain
me
longer

he
added
raising
his
voice
'hold

hold
hear
me
but
for
one
moment
tax
me
not
with
impurity
nor
think
that
i
have
erred
from
the
warmth
of
temperament
long
before
i
took
the
veil
raymond
was
master
of
my
heart
he
inspired
me
with
the
purest
the
most
irreproachable
passion
and
was
on
the
point
of
becoming
my
lawful
husband
an
horrible
adventure
and
the
treachery
of
a
relation
separated
us
from

believed
him
for
ever

threw
myself
into
a
convent

could
not

melancholy
pleasure

tears

in
the
gardens

in
an
unguarded
moment

the
door
of
the
vestry
opened
and
the
prioress
entered
the
chapel
followed
by
her
nuns
'cruel
cruel'
exclaimed
agnes
relinquishing
her
hold
wild
and
desperate
she
threw
herself
upon
the
ground
beating
her
bosom
and
rending
her
veil
in
all
the
delirium
of
despair
the
nuns
gazed
with
astonishment
upon
the
scene
before
them
the
friar
now
presented
the
fatal
paper
to
the
prioress
informed
her
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
found
it
and
added
that
it
was
her
business
to
decide
what
penance
the
delinquent
merited
while
she
perused
the
letter
the
domina's
countenance
grew
inflamed
with
passion
what
such
a
crime
committed
in
her
convent
and
made
known
to
ambrosio
to
the
idol
of
madrid
to
the
man
whom
she
was
most
anxious
to
impress
with
the
opinion
of
the
strictness
and
regularity
of
her
house
words
were
inadequate
to
express
her
fury
she
was
silent
and
darted
upon
the
prostrate
nun
looks
of
menace
and
malignity
'away
with
her
to
the
convent'
said
she
at
length
to
some
of
her
attendants
two
of
the
oldest
nuns
now
approaching
agnes
raised
her
forcibly
from
the
ground
and
prepared
to
conduct
her
from
the
chapel
'what'
she
exclaimed
suddenly
shaking
off
their
hold
with
distracted
gestures
'is
all
hope
then
lost
already
do
you
drag
me
to
punishment
where
are
you
raymond
oh
save
me
save
me'
then
casting
upon
the
abbot
a
frantic
look
'hear
me'
she
continued
'man
of
an
hard
heart
hear
me
proud
stern
and
cruel
you
could
have
saved
me
you
could
have
restored
me
to
happiness
and
virtue
but
would
not
you
are
the
destroyer
of
my
soul
you
are
my
murderer
and
on
you
fall
the
curse
of
my
death
and
my
unborn
infant's
insolent
in
your
yet-unshaken
virtue
you
disdained
the
prayers
of
a
penitent
but
god
will
show
mercy
though
you
show
none
and
where
is
the
merit
of
your
boasted
virtue
what
temptations
have
you
vanquished
coward
you
have
fled
from
it
not
opposed
seduction
but
the
day
of
trial
will
arrive
oh
then
when
you
yield
to
impetuous
passions
when
you
feel
that
man
is
weak
and
born
to
err
when
shuddering
you
look
back
upon
your
crimes
and
solicit
with
terror
the
mercy
of
your
god
oh
in
that
fearful
moment
think
upon
me
think
upon
your
cruelty
think
upon
agnes
and
despair
of
pardon'
as
she
uttered
these
last
words
her
strength
was
exhausted
and
she
sank
inanimate
upon
the
bosom
of
a
nun
who
stood
near
her
she
was
immediately
conveyed
from
the
chapel
and
her
companions
followed
her
ambrosio
had
not
listened
to
her
reproaches
without
emotion
a
secret
pang
at
his
heart
made
him
feel
that
he
had
treated
this
unfortunate
with
too
great
severity
he
therefore
detained
the
prioress
and
ventured
to
pronounce
some
words
in
favour
of
the
delinquent
'the
violence
of
her
despair'
said
he
'proves
that
at
least
vice
is
not
become
familiar
to
her
perhaps
by
treating
her
with
somewhat
less
rigour
than
is
generally
practised
and
mitigating
in
some
degree
the
accustomed
penance'
'mitigate
it
father'
interrupted
the
lady
prioress
'not
i
believe
me
the
laws
of
our
order
are
strict
and
severe
they
have
fallen
into
disuse
of
late
but
the
crime
of
agnes
shows
me
the
necessity
of
their
revival
i
go
to
signify
my
intention
to
the
convent
and
agnes
shall
be
the
first
to
feel
the
rigour
of
those
laws
which
shall
be
obeyed
to
the
very
letter
father
farewell'
thus
saying
she
hastened
out
of
the
chapel
'i
have
done
my
duty'
said
ambrosio
to
himself
still
did
he
not
feel
perfectly
satisfied
by
this
reflection
to
dissipate
the
unpleasant
ideas
which
this
scene
had
excited
in
him
upon
quitting
the
chapel
he
descended
into
the
abbey
garden
in
all
madrid
there
was
no
spot
more
beautiful
or
better
regulated
it
was
laid
out
with
the
most
exquisite
taste
the
choicest
flowers
adorned
it
in
the
height
of
luxuriance
and
though
artfully
arranged
seemed
only
planted
by
the
hand
of
nature
fountains
springing
from
basons
of
white
marble
cooled
the
air
with
perpetual
showers
and
the
walls
were
entirely
covered
by
jessamine
vines
and
honeysuckles
the
hour
now
added
to
the
beauty
of
the
scene
the
full
moon
ranging
through
a
blue
and
cloudless
sky
shed
upon
the
trees
a
trembling
lustre
and
the
waters
of
the
fountains
sparkled
in
the
silver
beam
a
gentle
breeze
breathed
the
fragrance
of
orange-blossoms
along
the
alleys
and
the
nightingale
poured
forth
her
melodious
murmur
from
the
shelter
of
an
artificial
wilderness
thither
the
abbot
bent
his
steps
in
the
bosom
of
this
little
grove
stood
a
rustic
grotto
formed
in
imitation
of
an
hermitage
the
walls
were
constructed
of
roots
of
trees
and
the
interstices
filled
up
with
moss
and
ivy
seats
of
turf
were
placed
on
either
side
and
a
natural
cascade
fell
from
the
rock
above
buried
in
himself
the
monk
approached
the
spot
the
universal
calm
had
communicated
itself
to
his
bosom
and
a
voluptuous
tranquillity
spread
languor
through
his
soul
he
reached
the
hermitage
and
was
entering
to
repose
himself
when
he
stopped
on
perceiving
it
to
be
already
occupied
extended
upon
one
of
the
banks
lay
a
man
in
a
melancholy
posture
his
head
was
supported
upon
his
arm
and
he
seemed
lost
in
mediation
the
monk
drew
nearer
and
recognised
rosario
he
watched
him
in
silence
and
entered
not
the
hermitage
after
some
minutes
the
youth
raised
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
mournfully
upon
the
opposite
wall
'yes'
said
he
with
a
deep
and
plaintive
sigh
'i
feel
all
the
happiness
of
thy
situation
all
the
misery
of
my
own
happy
were
i
could
i
think
like
thee
could
i
look
like
thee
with
disgust
upon
mankind
could
bury
myself
for
ever
in
some
impenetrable
solitude
and
forget
that
the
world
holds
beings
deserving
to
be
loved
oh
god
what
a
blessing
would
misanthropy
be
to
me'
'that
is
a
singular
thought
rosario'
said
the
abbot
entering
the
grotto
'you
here
reverend
father'
cried
the
novice
at
the
same
time
starting
from
his
place
in
confusion
he
drew
his
cowl
hastily
over
his
face
ambrosio
seated
himself
upon
the
bank
and
obliged
the
youth
to
place
himself
by
him
'you
must
not
indulge
this
disposition
to
melancholy'
said
he
'what
can
possibly
have
made
you
view
in
so
desirable
a
light
misanthropy
of
all
sentiments
the
most
hateful'
'the
perusal
of
these
verses
father
which
till
now
had
escaped
my
observation
the
brightness
of
the
moonbeams
permitted
my
reading
them
and
oh
how
i
envy
the
feelings
of
the
writer'
as
he
said
this
he
pointed
to
a
marble
tablet
fixed
against
the
opposite
wall
on
it
were
engraved
the
following
lines

in
an
hermitage

thou

my
lonely

with

conscience
bleeding
hath
led
me
here

my
bosom
sowrs
free-willed
i
fled
from
courtly
bowers
for

i
saw
in

towers
that
lust

pride
the
arch-fiend's
dearest
darkest
powers

i
saw
mankind
with
vice
incrusted
i
saw
that
honour's
sword
was
rusted
that
few
for
aught

folly
lusted
that
he
was
still
deceiv'd
who
trusted
in

hither
came
with
men
disgusted
my
life
to
end
in
this
lone
cave
in
garments
lowly
alike

foe

noisy
folly

more
in

than
e'er
i
felt
before
in
a
palace
and
with
thoughts
still
soaring
to
god
on
high
each
night
and
morn
with
voice
imploring
this
wish
i
sigh
'let
me
oh
lord
from
life
retire
unknown

guilty
worldly

remorseful
throb
or
loose

stranger
if
full
of
youth
and
riot
as
yet
no
grief
has
marred
thy
quiet
thou
haply
throw'st
a
scornful

at

hermit's
prayer

thou
lament

'were
it
possible'
said
the
friar
'for
man
to
be
so
totally
wrapped
up
in
himself
as
to
live
in
absolute
seclusion
from
human
nature
and
could
yet
feel
the
contented
tranquillity
which
these
lines
express
i
allow
that
the
situation
would
be
more
desirable
than
to
live
in
a
world
so
pregnant
with
every
vice
and
every
folly
but
this
never
can
be
the
case
this
inscription
was
merely
placed
here
for
the
ornament
of
the
grotto
and
the
sentiments
and
the
hermit
are
equally
imaginary
man
was
born
for
society
however
little
he
may
be
attached
to
the
world
he
never
can
wholly
forget
it
or
bear
to
be
wholly
forgotten
by
it
disgusted
at
the
guilt
or
absurdity
of
mankind
the
misanthrope
flies
from
it
he
resolves
to
become
an
hermit
and
buries
himself
in
the
cavern
of
some
gloomy
rock
while
hate
inflames
his
bosom
possibly
he
may
feel
contented
with
his
situation
but
when
his
passions
begin
to
cool
when
time
has
mellowed
his
sorrows
and
healed
those
wounds
which
he
bore
with
him
to
his
solitude
think
you
that
content
becomes
his
companion
ah
no
rosario
no
longer
sustained
by
the
violence
of
his
passions
he
feels
all
the
monotony
of
his
way
of
living
and
his
heart
becomes
the
prey
of
ennui
and
weariness
he
looks
round
and
finds
himself
alone
in
the
universe
the
love
of
society
revives
in
his
bosom
and
he
pants
to
return
to
that
world
which
he
has
abandoned
nature
loses
all
her
charms
in
his
eyes
no
one
is
near
him
to
point
out
her
beauties
or
share
in
his
admiration
of
her
excellence
and
variety
propped
upon
the
fragment
of
some
rock
he
gazes
upon
the
tumbling
waterfall
with
a
vacant
eye
he
views
without
emotion
the
glory
of
the
setting
sun
slowly
he
returns
to
his
cell
at
evening
for
no
one
there
is
anxious
for
his
arrival
he
has
no
comfort
in
his
solitary
unsavoury
meal
he
throws
himself
upon
his
couch
of
moss
despondent
and
dissatisfied
and
wakes
only
to
pass
a
day
as
joyless
as
monotonous
as
the
former'
'you
amaze
me

not
the

starting
from

bank
and
grasping

a
frantic
air

with
these
words
he
flew
hastily
from
the
grotto
ambrosio
remained
in
his
former
attitude
reflecting
on
the
youth's
unaccountable
behaviour
he
was
inclined
to
suspect
the
derangement
of
his
senses
yet
the
general
tenor
of
his
conduct
the
connexion
of
his
ideas
and
calmness
of
his
demeanour
till
the
moment
of
his
quitting
the
grotto
seemed
to
discountenance
this
conjecture

a
few
minutes
rosario
returned
he
again
seated
himself
upon
the
bank
he
reclined
his
cheek
upon
one
hand
and
with
the
other
wiped
away
the
tears
which
trickled
from
his
eyes
at
intervals
the
monk
looked
upon
him
with
compassion
and
forbore
to
interrupt
his
meditations
both
observed
for
some
time
a
profound
silence
the
nightingale
had
now
taken
her
station
upon
an
orange
tree
fronting
the
hermitage
and
poured
forth
a
strain
the
most
melancholy
and
melodious
rosario
raised
his
head
and
listened
to
her
with
attention
'it
was
thus'
said
he
with
a
deep-drawn
sigh
'it
was
thus
that
during
the
last
month
of
her
unhappy
life
my

to
sit
listening
to
the
nightingale
poor
matilda
she
sleeps
in
the
grave
and
her
broken
heart
throbs
no
more
with

'you

'you

'they

not

irresistible

fatal

which
her
heart
was
a
prey

loved
unfortunately
a
passion
for

endowed
with
every
virtue

oh
rather

the
bane

never

bestowed

her

obtaining

'father
before

julian
had
already
plighted
his
vows

loved
and
for
the
husband's
sake
she
doted
upon
the
wife
one
morning
she
found
means
to
escape
from
our
father's
house
arrayed
in
humble
weeds
she
offered
herself
as
a
domestic
to
the
consort

accepted
she
was
now
continually
in

strove
to
ingratiate
herself
into
his
favour
she
succeeded
her
attentions
attracted
julian's
notice

virtuous
are
ever
grateful

he
distinguished
matilda
above
the
rest
of
her
companions'
'and
did
not

submit
tamely

recover

'ere
they
could
find
her
she
discovered
herself
her
love
grew
too
violent
for
concealment

she
wished
not
for
julian's
person
she
ambitioned
but
a
share
of
his
heart
in
an
unguarded
moment
she
confessed
her
affection

was
the
return
doating
upon
his
wife
and
believing
that
a
look
of
pity
bestowed
upon
another
was
a
theft
from
what
he
owed
to
her
he
drove
matilda
from
his
presence
he
forbad
her
ever
again
appearing
before
him
his
severity
broke
her
heart
she
returned
to
her
father's
and
in
a
few
months
after
was
carried
to
her
grave'
'unhappy
girl
surely
her
fate
was
too
severe
and
julian
was
too
cruel'
'do
you
think
so
father'
cried
the
novice
with
vivacity
'do
you
think
that
he
was
cruel'
'doubtless
i
do
and
pity
her
most
sincerely'
'you

father
then

me'
the
friar
started
when
after
a
moment's
pause
rosario
added
with
a
faltering
voice--'for
my
sufferings
are
still
greater
my

a

pitied
the
acuteness

as
he
uttered
these
words
he
sobbed
audibly
the
friar
was

it
with
tenderness

you
consider
me
as
no

may
i
assume
that
title

never
did
parent
watch
over
a
child
more
fondly
than
i
have
watched
over
you
from
the
moment
in
which
i
first
beheld
you
i
perceived
sensations
in
my
bosom
till
then
unknown
to
me
i
found
a
delight
in
your
society
which
no
one's
else
could
afford
and
when
i
witnessed
the
extent
of
your
genius
and
information
i
rejoiced
as
does
a
father
in
the
perfections
of
his
son
then
lay
aside
your
fears
speak
to
me
with
openness
speak
to
me

say
that
you
will
confide
in
me

my
aid

my
pity
can
alleviate
your
distress'
'yours
can
yours
only
can
ah
father

willingly
would
i
unveil
to
you
my
heart
how
willingly
would
i
declare
the
secret
which
bows
me
down
with
its
weight
but
oh
i
fear
i
fear'
'what
my
son'
'that
you
should
abhor
me
for
my
weakness
that
the
reward
of
my
confidence
should
be
the
loss
of
your
esteem'
'how

upon
the
whole
of

paternal
tenderness

i
have
ever
shown
you

you

it
is
no
longer
in
my
power
to
give
up
your
society
would
be
to
deprive
myself
of
the
greatest
pleasure
of
my
life

reveal
to
me
what
afflicts
you
and
believe
me
while
i
solemnly

'hold'
interrupted
the
novice
'swear
that
whatever
be
my
secret
you
will
not
oblige
me
to
quit
the
monastery
till
my
noviciate
shall
expire'
'i

it
faithfully

i

my

to

up

continued
he
throwing
himself
at
the
friar's
feet
and
pressing
his
hand
to
his
lips
with
eagerness
while
agitation
for
a
moment
choaked
his
voice
'father'
continued
he
in
faltering
accents
'i
am
a
woman'
the
abbot
started
at
this
unexpected
avowal
prostrate
on
the
ground
lay
the
feigned
rosario
as
if
waiting
in
silence
the
decision
of
his
judge
astonishment
on
the
one
part
apprehension
on
the
other
for
some
minutes
chained
them
in
the
same
attitudes
as
had
they
been
touched
by
the
rod
of
some
magician
at
length
recovering
from
his
confusion
the
monk
quitted
the
grotto
and
sped
with
precipitation
towards
the
abbey
his
action
did
not
escape
the
suppliant
she
sprang
from
the
ground
she
hastened
to
follow
him
overtook
him
threw
herself
in
his
passage
and
embraced
his
knees
ambrosio
strove
in
vain
to
disengage
himself
from
her
grasp
'do
not
fly
me'
she
cried
'leave
me
not
abandoned
to
the
impulse
of
despair
listen
while
i
excuse
my
imprudence
while
i
acknowledge
my
sister's
story
to
be
my
own
i
am
matilda
you
are
her
beloved'
if
ambrosio's
surprise
was
great
at
her
first
avowal
upon
hearing
her
second
it
exceeded
all
bounds
amazed
embarrassed
and
irresolute
he
found
himself
incapable
of
pronouncing
a
syllable
and
remained
in
silence
gazing
upon
matilda
this
gave
her
opportunity
to
continue
her
explanation
as
follows
'think
not
ambrosio
that
i
come
to
rob
your
bride
of
your
affections
no
believe
me
religion
alone
deserves
you
and
far
is
it
from
matilda's
wish
to
draw
you
from
the
paths
of
virtue
what
i
feel
for
you
is
love
not
licentiousness
i
sigh
to
be
possessor
of
your
heart
not
lust
for
the
enjoyment
of
your
person
deign
to
listen
to
my
vindication
a
few
moments
will
convince
you
that
this
holy
retreat
is
not
polluted
by
my
presence
and
that
you
may
grant
me
your
compassion
without
trespassing
against
your
vows'--she
seated
herself
ambrosio
scarcely
conscious
of
what
he
did
followed
her
example
and
she
proceeded
in
her
discourse
'i
spring
from
a
distinguished
family
my
father
was
chief
of
the
noble
house
of
villanegas
he
died
while
i
was
still
an
infant
and
left
me
sole
heiress
of
his
immense
possessions
young
and
wealthy
i
was
sought
in
marriage
by
the
noblest
youths
of
madrid
but
no
one
succeeded
in
gaining
my
affections
i
had
been
brought
up
under
the
care
of
an
uncle
possessed
of
the
most
solid
judgment
and
extensive
erudition
he
took
pleasure
in
communicating
to
me
some
portion
of
his
knowledge
under
his
instructions
my
understanding
acquired
more
strength
and
justness
than
generally
falls
to
the
lot
of
my
sex
the
ability
of
my
preceptor
being
aided
by
natural
curiosity
i
not
only
made
a
considerable
progress
in
sciences
universally
studied
but
in
others
revealed
but
to
few
and
lying
under
censure
from
the
blindness
of
superstition
but
while
my
guardian
laboured
to
enlarge
the
sphere
of
my
knowledge
he
carefully
inculcated
every
moral
precept
he
relieved
me
from
the
shackles
of
vulgar
prejudice
he
pointed
out
the
beauty
of
religion
he
taught
me
to
look
with
adoration
upon
the
pure
and
virtuous
and
woe
is
me
i
have
obeyed
him
but
too
well
'with
such
dispositions
judge
whether
i
could
observe
with
any
other
sentiment
than
disgust
the
vice
dissipation
and
ignorance
which
disgrace
our
spanish
youth
i
rejected
every
offer
with
disdain
my
heart
remained
without
a
master
till
chance
conducted
me
to
the
cathedral
of
the
capuchins
oh
surely
on
that
day
my
guardian
angel
slumbered
neglectful
of
his
charge
then
was
it
that
i
first
beheld
you
you
supplied
the
superior's
place
absent
from
illness
you
cannot
but
remember
the
lively
enthusiasm
which
your
discourse
created
oh
how
i
drank
your
words
how
your
eloquence
seemed
to
steal
me
from
myself
i
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
fearing
to
lose
a
syllable
and
while
you
spoke
methought
a
radiant
glory
beamed
round
your
head
and
your
countenance
shone
with
the
majesty
of
a
god
i
retired
from
the
church
glowing
with
admiration
from
that
moment
you
became
the
idol
of
my
heart
the
never-changing
object
of
my
meditations
i
enquired
respecting
you
the
reports
which
were
made
me
of
your
mode
of
life
of
your
knowledge
piety
and
self-denial
riveted
the
chains
imposed
on
me
by
your
eloquence
i
was
conscious
that
there
was
no
longer
a
void
in
my
heart
that
i
had
found
the
man
whom
i
had
sought
till
then
in
vain
in
expectation
of
hearing
you
again
every
day
i
visited
your
cathedral
you
remained
secluded
within
the
abbey
walls
and
i
always
withdrew
wretched
and
disappointed
the
night
was
more
propitious
to
me
for
then
you
stood
before
me
in
my
dreams
you
vowed
to
me
eternal
friendship
you
led
me
through
the
paths
of
virtue
and
assisted
me
to
support
the
vexations
of
life
the
morning
dispelled
these
pleasing
visions
i
woke
and
found
myself
separated
from
you
by
barriers
which
appeared
insurmountable
time
seemed
only
to
increase
the
strength
of
my
passion
i
grew
melancholy
and
despondent
i
fled
from
society
and
my
health
declined
daily
at
length
no
longer
able
to
exist
in
this
state
of
torture
i
resolved
to
assume
the
disguise
in
which
you
see
me
my
artifice
was
fortunate
i
was
received
into
the
monastery
and
succeeded
in
gaining
your
esteem
'now
then
i
should
have
felt
compleatly
happy
had
not
my
quiet
been
disturbed
by
the
fear
of
detection
the
pleasure
which
i
received
from
your
society
was
embittered
by
the
idea
that
perhaps
i
should
soon
be
deprived
of
it
and
my
heart
throbbed
so
rapturously
at
obtaining
the
marks
of
your
friendship
as
to
convince
me
that
i
never
should
survive
its
loss
i
resolved
therefore
not
to
leave
the
discovery
of
my
sex
to
chance
to
confess
the
whole
to
you
and
throw
myself
entirely
on
your
mercy
and
indulgence
ah
ambrosio
can
i
have
been
deceived
can
you
be
less
generous
than
i
thought
you
i
will
not
suspect
it
you
will
not
drive
a
wretch
to
despair
i
shall
still
be
permitted
to
see
you
to
converse
with
you
to
adore
you
your
virtues
shall
be
my
example
through
life
and
when
we
expire
our
bodies
shall
rest
in
the
same
grave'
she
ceased
while
she
spoke
a
thousand
opposing
sentiments
combated
in
ambrosio's
bosom
surprise
at
the
singularity
of
this
adventure
confusion
at
her
abrupt
declaration
resentment
at
her
boldness
in
entering
the
monastery
and
consciousness
of
the
austerity
with
which
it
behoved
him
to
reply
such
were
the
sentiments
of
which
he
was
aware
but
there
were
others
also
which
did
not
obtain
his
notice
he
perceived
not
that
his
vanity
was
flattered
by
the
praises
bestowed
upon
his
eloquence
and
virtue
that
he
felt
a
secret
pleasure
in
reflecting
that
a
young
and
seemingly
lovely
woman
had
for
his
sake
abandoned
the
world
and
sacrificed
every
other
passion
to
that
which
he
had
inspired
still
less
did
he
perceive
that
his
heart
throbbed
with
desire
while
his
hand
was
pressed
gently
by
matilda's
ivory
fingers
by
degrees
he
recovered
from
his
confusion
his
ideas
became
less
bewildered
he
was
immediately
sensible
of
the
extreme
impropriety
should
matilda
be
permitted
to
remain
in
the
abbey
after
this
avowal
of
her
sex
he
assumed
an
air
of
severity
and
drew
away
his
hand
'how
lady'
said
he
'can
you
really
hope
for
my
permission
to
remain
amongst
us
even
were
i
to
grant
your
request
what
good
could
you
derive
from
it
think
you
that
i
ever
can
reply
to
an
affection
which'
'no
father
no
i
expect
not
to
inspire
you
with
a
love
like
mine
i
only
wish
for
the
liberty
to
be
near
you
to
pass
some
hours
of
the
day
in
your
society
to
obtain
your
compassion
your
friendship
and
esteem
surely
my
request
is
not
unreasonable'
'but
reflect
lady
reflect
only
for
a
moment
on
the
impropriety
of
my
harbouring
a
woman
in
the
abbey
and
that
too
a
woman
who
confesses
that
she
loves
me
it
must
not
be
the
risque
of
your
being
discovered
is
too
great
and
i
will
not
expose
myself
to
so
dangerous
a
temptation'
'temptation
say
you
forget
that
i
am
a
woman
and
it
no
longer
exists
consider
me
only
as
a
friend
as
an
unfortunate
whose
happiness
whose
life
depends
upon
your
protection
fear
not
lest
i
should
ever
call
to
your
remembrance
that
love
the
most
impetuous
the
most
unbounded
has
induced
me
to
disguise
my
sex
or
that
instigated
by
desires
offensive
to
your
vows
and
my
own
honour
i
should
endeavour
to
seduce
you
from
the
path
of
rectitude
no
ambrosio
learn
to
know
me
better
i
love
you
for
your
virtues
lose
them
and
with
them
you
lose
my
affections
i
look
upon
you
as
a
saint
prove
to
me
that
you
are
no
more
than
man
and
i
quit
you
with
disgust
is
it
then
from
me
that
you
fear
temptation
from
me
in
whom
the
world's
dazzling
pleasures
created
no
other
sentiment
than
contempt
from
me

attachment
is
grounded
on
your
exemption
from
human
frailty
oh
dismiss
such
injurious
apprehensions
think
nobler
of
me
think
nobler
of
yourself
i
am
incapable
of
seducing
you
to
error
and
surely
your
virtue
is
established
on
a
basis
too
firm
to
be
shaken
by
unwarranted
desires
ambrosio
dearest
ambrosio
drive
me
not
from
your
presence
remember
your
promise
and
authorize
my
stay'
'impossible
matilda
your

commands
me
to
refuse
your

i
tremble
for
you
not
for
myself
after
vanquishing
the
impetuous
ebullitions
of
youth
after
passing
thirty
years
in
mortification
and
penance
i
might
safely
permit
your

fear
your
inspiring

with
warmer

to
yourself
remaining
in

produce

fatal
consequences
you
will
misconstrue

will
seize

avidity
which
encourages
you
to
hope

it
would
be
culpable

open
your
eyes

feel
that
duty
obliges
my
treating
you
with
harshness
i
must
reject
your
prayer

remove
every
shadow
of
hope

may
aid
to
nourish
sentiments

pernicious

from

'tomorrow

surely
you
cannot
mean

cannot
resolve
on
driving
me
to
despair

cannot
have
the
cruelty'
'you
have
heard
my
decision

declare

you

from
hence--i
pity
you
but
can
do
no

he
pronounced
these
words
in
a
faint
and
trembling
voice
then
rising
from
his
seat
he
would
have
hastened
towards
the
monastery
uttering
a
loud
shriek
matilda
followed
and
detained
him
'stay
yet
one
moment
ambrosio
hear
me
yet
speak
one
word'
'i
dare
not

release
me
you
know
my

'but
one
word

i

'leave

your
entreaties
are
in
vain
you
must
from
hence
tomorrow'
'go
then
barbarian
but
this
resource
is
still
left
me'
as
she
said
this
she
suddenly
drew
a
poignard
she
rent
open
her
garment
and
placed
the
weapon's
point
against
her
bosom
'father
i
will
never
quit
these
walls
alive'
'hold
hold
matilda
what
would
you
do'
'you
are
determined
so
am
i
the
moment
that
you
leave
me
i
plunge
this
steel
in
my
heart'
'holy
st
francis
matilda
have
you
your
senses
do
you
know
the
consequences
of
your
action
that
suicide
is
the
greatest
of
crimes

you
destroy

you
lose

salvation

you
prepare

yourself
everlasting
torments'
'i
care
not
i
care
not'
she
replied
passionately
'either
your
hand
guides
me
to
paradise

my
own
dooms
me
to
perdition

to
me
ambrosio
tell
me
that
you
will
conceal
my
story
that
i
shall
remain
your
friend
and
your
companion
or
this
poignard
drinks
my
blood'
as
she
uttered
these
last
words
she
lifted
her
arm
and
made
a
motion
as
if
to
stab
herself
the
friar's
eyes
followed
with
dread
the
course
of
the
dagger
she
had
torn
open
her
habit
and
her
bosom
was
half
exposed
the
weapon's
point
rested
upon
her
left
breast
and
oh
that
was
such
a
breast
the
moonbeams
darting
full
upon
it
enabled
the
monk
to
observe
its
dazzling
whiteness
his
eye
dwelt
with
insatiable
avidity
upon
the
beauteous
orb
a
sensation
till
then
unknown
filled
his
heart
with
a
mixture
of
anxiety
and
delight
a
raging
fire
shot
through
every
limb
the
blood
boiled
in
his
veins
and
a
thousand
wild
wishes
bewildered
his
imagination
'hold'
he
cried
in
an
hurried
faultering
voice
'i
can
resist
no
longer
stay
then
enchantress
stay
for
my
destruction'
he
said
and
rushing
from
the
place
hastened
towards
the
monastery
he
regained
his
cell
and
threw
himself
upon
his
couch
distracted
irresolute
and
confused
he
found
it
impossible
for
some
time
to
arrange
his
ideas
the
scene
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
had
excited
such
a
variety
of
sentiments
in
his
bosom
that
he
was
incapable
of
deciding
which
was
predominant
he
was
irresolute
what
conduct
he
ought
to
hold
with
the
disturber
of
his
repose
he
was
conscious
that
prudence
religion
and
propriety
necessitated
his
obliging
her
to
quit
the
abbey
but
on
the
other
hand
such
powerful
reasons
authorized
her
stay
that
he
was
but
too
much
inclined
to
consent
to
her
remaining
he
could
not
avoid
being
flattered
by
matilda's
declaration
and
at
reflecting
that
he
had
unconsciously
vanquished
an
heart
which
had
resisted
the
attacks
of
spain's
noblest
cavaliers
the
manner
in
which
he
had
gained
her
affections
was
also
the
most
satisfactory
to
his
vanity
he
remembered
the
many
happy
hours
which
he
had
passed
in
rosario's
society
and
dreaded
that
void
in
his
heart
which
parting
with
him
would
occasion
besides
all
this
he
considered
that
as
matilda
was
wealthy
her
favour
might
be
of
essential
benefit
to
the
abbey
'and
what
do
i
risque'
said
he
to
himself
'by
authorizing
her
stay
may
i
not
safely
credit
her
assertions
will
it
not
be
easy
for
me
to
forget
her
sex
and
still
consider
her
as
my
friend
and
my
disciple
surely
her
love
is
as
pure
as
she
describes
had
it
been
the
offspring
of
mere
licentiousness
would
she
so
long
have
concealed
it
in
her
own
bosom
would
she
not
have
employed
some
means
to
procure
its
gratification
she
has
done
quite
the
contrary
she
strove
to
keep
me
in
ignorance
of
her
sex
and
nothing
but
the
fear
of
detection
and
my
instances
would
have
compelled
her
to
reveal
the
secret
she
has
observed
the
duties
of
religion
not
less
strictly
than
myself
she
has
made
no
attempts
to
rouze
my
slumbering
passions
nor
has
she
ever
conversed
with
me
till
this
night
on
the
subject
of
love
had
she
been
desirous
to
gain
my
affections
not
my
esteem
she
would
not
have
concealed
from
me
her
charms
so
carefully
at
this
very
moment
i
have
never
seen
her
face
yet
certainly
that
face
must
be
lovely
and
her
person
beautiful
to
judge
by
her

by
what
i
have
seen'
as
this
last
idea
passed
through
his
imagination
a
blush
spread
itself
over
his
cheek
alarmed
at
the
sentiments
which
he
was
indulging
he
betook
himself
to
prayer
he
started
from
his
couch
knelt
before
the
beautiful
madona
and
entreated
her
assistance
in
stifling
such
culpable
emotions
he
then
returned
to
his
bed
and
resigned
himself
to
slumber
he
awoke
heated
and
unrefreshed
during
his
sleep
his
inflamed
imagination
had
presented
him
with
none
but
the
most
voluptuous
objects
matilda
stood
before
him
in
his
dreams
and
his
eyes
again
dwelt
upon
her
naked
breast
she
repeated
her
protestations
of
eternal
love
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
loaded
him
with
kisses
he
returned
them
he
clasped
her
passionately
to
his
bosom
and

the
vision
was
dissolved
sometimes
his
dreams
presented
the
image
of
his
favourite
madona
and
he
fancied
that
he
was
kneeling
before
her
as
he
offered
up
his
vows
to
her
the
eyes
of
the
figure
seemed
to
beam
on
him
with
inexpressible
sweetness
he
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
and
found
them
warm
the
animated
form
started
from
the
canvas
embraced
him
affectionately
and
his
senses
were
unable
to
support
delight
so
exquisite
such
were
the
scenes
on
which
his
thoughts
were
employed
while
sleeping
his
unsatisfied
desires
placed
before
him
the
most
lustful
and
provoking
images
and
he
rioted
in
joys
till
then
unknown
to
him
he
started
from
his
couch
filled
with
confusion
at
the
remembrance
of
his
dreams
scarcely
was
he
less
ashamed
when
he
reflected
on
his
reasons
of
the
former
night
which
induced
him
to
authorize
matilda's
stay
the
cloud
was
now
dissipated
which
had
obscured
his
judgment
he
shuddered
when
he
beheld
his
arguments
blazoned
in
their
proper
colours
and
found
that
he
had
been
a
slave
to
flattery
to
avarice
and
self-love
if
in
one
hour's
conversation
matilda
had
produced
a
change
so
remarkable
in
his
sentiments
what
had
he
not
to
dread
from
her
remaining
in
the
abbey
become
sensible
of
his
danger
awakened
from
his
dream
of
confidence
he
resolved
to
insist
on
her
departing
without
delay
he
began
to
feel
that
he
was
not
proof
against
temptation
and
that
however
matilda
might
restrain
herself
within
the
bounds
of
modesty
he
was
unable
to
contend
with
those
passions
from
which
he
falsely
thought
himself
exempted
'agnes
agnes'
he
exclaimed
while
reflecting
on
his
embarrassments
'i
already
feel
thy
curse'
he
quitted
his
cell
determined
upon
dismissing
the
feigned
rosario
he
appeared
at
matins
but
his
thoughts
were
absent
and
he
paid
them
but
little
attention
his
heart
and
brain
were
both
of
them
filled
with
worldly
objects
and
he
prayed
without
devotion
the
service
over
he
descended
into
the
garden
he
bent
his
steps
towards
the
same
spot
where
on
the
preceding
night
he
had
made
this
embarrassing
discovery
he
doubted
not
but
that
matilda
would
seek
him
there
he
was
not
deceived
she
soon
entered
the
hermitage
and
approached
the
monk
with
a
timid
air
after
a
few
minutes
during
which
both
were
silent
she
appeared
as
if
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
the
abbot
who
during
this
time
had
been
summoning
up
all
his
resolution
hastily
interrupted
her
though
still
unconscious
how
extensive
was
its
influence
he
dreaded
the
melodious
seduction
of
her
voice
'seat
yourself
by
my
side
matilda'
said
he
assuming
a
look
of
firmness
though
carefully
avoiding
the
least
mixture
of
severity
'listen
to
me
patiently
and
believe
that
in
what
i
shall
say
i
am
not
more
influenced
by
my
own
interest
than
by
yours
believe
that
i
feel
for
you
the
warmest
friendship
the
truest
compassion
and
that
you
cannot
feel
more
grieved
than
i
do
when
i
declare
to
you
that
we
must
never
meet
again'
'ambrosio'
she
cried
in
a
voice
at
once
expressive
of
surprise
and
sorrow
'be
calm
my
friend
my
rosario
still
let
me
call
you
by
that
name
so
dear
to
me
our
separation
is
unavoidable
i
blush
to
own
how
sensibly
it
affects
me--
but
yet
it
must
be
so
i
feel
myself
incapable
of
treating
you
with
indifference
and
that
very
conviction
obliges
me
to
insist
upon
your
departure
matilda
you
must
stay
here
no
longer'
'oh
where
shall
i
now
seek
for
probity
disgusted
with
a
perfidious
world
in
what
happy
region
does
truth
conceal
herself
father
i
hoped
that
she
resided
here
i
thought
that
your
bosom
had
been
her
favourite
shrine
and
you
too
prove
false
oh
god
and
you
too
can
betray
me'
'matilda'
'yes
father
yes
'tis
with
justice
that
i
reproach
you
oh
where
are
your
promises
my
noviciate
is
not
expired
and
yet
will
you
compell
me
to
quit
the
monastery
can
you
have
the
heart
to
drive
me
from
you
and
have
i
not
received
your
solemn
oath
to
the
contrary'
'i
will
not
compell
you
to
quit
the
monastery
you
have
received
my
solemn
oath
to
the
contrary
but
yet
when
i
throw
myself
upon
your
generosity
when
i
declare
to
you
the
embarrassments
in
which
your
presence
involves
me
will
you
not
release
me
from
that
oath
reflect
upon
the
danger
of
a
discovery
upon
the
opprobrium
in
which
such
an
event
would
plunge
me
reflect
that
my
honour
and
reputation
are
at
stake
and
that
my
peace
of
mind
depends
on
your
compliance
as
yet
my
heart
is
free
i
shall
separate
from
you
with
regret
but
not
with
despair
stay
here
and
a
few
weeks
will
sacrifice
my
happiness
on
the
altar
of
your
charms
you
are
but
too
interesting
too
amiable
i
should
love
you
i
should
doat
on
you
my
bosom
would
become
the
prey
of
desires
which
honour
and
my
profession
forbid
me
to
gratify
if
i
resisted
them
the
impetuosity
of
my
wishes
unsatisfied
would
drive
me
to
madness
if
i
yielded
to
the
temptation
i
should
sacrifice
to
one
moment
of
guilty
pleasure
my
reputation
in
this
world
my
salvation
in
the
next
to
you
then
i
fly
for
defence
against
myself
preserve
me
from
losing
the
reward
of
thirty
years
of
sufferings
preserve
me
from
becoming
the
victim
of
remorse
your
heart
has
already
felt
the
anguish
of
hopeless
love
oh
then
if
you
really
value
me
spare
mine
that
anguish
give
me
back
my
promise
fly
from
these
walls
go
and
you
bear
with
you
my
warmest
prayers
for
your
happiness
my
friendship
my
esteem
and
admiration
stay
and
you
become
to
me
the
source
of
danger
of
sufferings
of
despair
answer
me
matilda
what
is
your
resolve'--she
was
silent--'will
you
not
speak
matilda
will
you
not
name
your
choice'
'cruel
cruel'
she
exclaimed
wringing
her
hands
in
agony
'you
know
too
well
that
you
offer
me
no
choice
you
know
too
well
that
i
can
have
no
will
but
yours'
'i
was
not
then
deceived
matilda's
generosity
equals
my
expectations'
'yes
i
will
prove
the
truth
of
my
affection
by
submitting
to
a
decree
which
cuts
me
to
the
very
heart
take
back
your
promise
i
will
quit
the
monastery
this
very
day
i
have
a
relation
abbess
of
a
covent
in
estramadura
to
her
will
i
bend
my
steps
and
shut
myself
from
the
world
for
ever
yet
tell
me
father
shall
i
bear
your
good
wishes
with
me
to
my
solitude
will
you
sometimes
abstract
your
attention
from
heavenly
objects
to
bestow
a
thought
upon
me'
'ah
matilda
i
fear
that
i
shall
think
on
you
but
too
often
for
my
repose'
'then
i
have
nothing
more
to
wish
for
save
that
we
may
meet
in
heaven
farewell
my
friend
my
ambrosio--
and
yet
methinks
i
would
fain
bear
with
me
some
token
of
your
regard'
'what
shall
i
give
you'
'something--any
thing--one
of
those
flowers
will
be
sufficient'
here
she
pointed
to
a
bush
of
roses
planted
at
the
door
of
the
grotto
'i
will
hide
it
in
my
bosom
and
when
i
am
dead
the
nuns
shall
find
it
withered
upon
my
heart'
the
friar
was
unable
to
reply
with
slow
steps
and
a
soul
heavy
with
affliction
he
quitted
the
hermitage
he
approached
the
bush
and
stooped
to
pluck
one
of
the
roses
suddenly
he
uttered
a
piercing
cry
started
back
hastily
and
let
the
flower
which
he
already
held
fall
from
his
hand
matilda
heard
the
shriek
and
flew
anxiously
towards
him
'what
is
the
matter'
she
cried
'answer
me
for
god's
sake
what
has
happened'
'i
have
received
my
death'
he
replied
in
a
faint
voice
'concealed
among
the
roses

a
serpent'
here
the
pain
of
his
wound
became
so
exquisite
that
nature
was
unable
to
bear
it
his
senses
abandoned
him
and
he
sank
inanimate
into
matilda's
arms
her
distress
was
beyond
the
power
of
description
she
rent
her
hair
beat
her
bosom
and
not
daring
to
quit
ambrosio
endeavoured
by
loud
cries
to
summon
the
monks
to
her
assistance
she
at
length
succeeded
alarmed
by
her
shrieks
several
of
the
brothers
hastened
to
the
spot
and
the
superior
was
conveyed
back
to
the
abbey
he
was
immediately
put
to
bed
and
the
monk
who
officiated
as
surgeon
to
the
fraternity
prepared
to
examine
the
wound
by
this
time
ambrosio's
hand
had
swelled
to
an
extraordinary
size
the
remedies
which
had
been
administered
to
him
'tis
true
restored
him
to
life
but
not
to
his
senses
he
raved
in
all
the
horrors
of
delirium
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
four
of
the
strongest
monks
were
scarcely
able
to
hold
him
in
his
bed
father
pablos
such
was
the
surgeon's
name
hastened
to
examine
the
wounded
hand
the
monks
surrounded
the
bed
anxiously
waiting
for
the
decision
among
these
the
feigned
rosario
appeared
not
the
most
insensible
to
the
friar's
calamity
he
gazed
upon
the
sufferer
with
inexpressible
anguish
and
the
groans
which
every
moment
escaped
from
his
bosom
sufficiently
betrayed
the
violence
of
his
affliction
father
pablos
probed
the
wound
as
he
drew
out
his
lancet
its
point
was
tinged
with
a
greenish
hue
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
and
quitted
the
bedside
''tis
as
i
feared'
said
he
'there
is
no
hope'
'no
hope'
exclaimed
the
monks
with
one
voice
'say
you
no
hope'
'from
the
sudden
effects
i
suspected
that
the
abbot
was
stung
by
a
cientipedoro
the
venom
which
you
see
upon
my
lancet
confirms
my
idea
he
cannot
live
three
days'
'and
can
no
possible
remedy
be
found'
enquired
rosario
'without
extracting
the
poison
he
cannot
recover
and
how
to
extract
it
is
to
me
still
a
secret
all
that
i
can
do
is
to
apply
such
herbs
to
the
wound
as
will
relieve
the
anguish
the
patient
will
be
restored
to
his
senses
but
the
venom
will
corrupt
the
whole
mass
of
his
blood
and
in
three
days
he
will
exist
no
longer'
excessive
was
the
universal
grief
at
hearing
this
decision
pablos
as
he
had
promised
dressed
the
wound
and
then
retired
followed
by
his
companions
rosario
alone
remained
in
the
cell
the
abbot
at
his
urgent
entreaty
having
been
committed
to
his
care
ambrosio's
strength
worn
out
by
the
violence
of
his
exertions
he
had
by
this
time
fallen
into
a
profound
sleep
so
totally
was
he
overcome
by
weariness
that
he
scarcely
gave
any
signs
of
life
he
was
still
in
this
situation
when
the
monks
returned
to
enquire
whether
any
change
had
taken
place
pablos
loosened
the
bandage
which
concealed
the
wound
more
from
a
principle
of
curiosity
than
from
indulging
the
hope
of
discovering
any
favourable
symptoms
what
was
his
astonishment
at
finding
that
the
inflammation
had
totally
subsided
he
probed
the
hand
his
lancet
came
out
pure
and
unsullied
no
traces
of
the
venom
were
perceptible
and
had
not
the
orifice
still
been
visible
pablos
might
have
doubted
that
there
had
ever
been
a
wound
he
communicated
this
intelligence
to
his
brethren
their
delight
was
only
equalled
by
their
surprize
from
the
latter
sentiment
however
they
were
soon
released
by
explaining
the
circumstance
according
to
their
own
ideas
they
were
perfectly
convinced
that
their
superior
was
a
saint
and
thought
that
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
for
st
francis
to
have
operated
a
miracle
in
his
favour
this
opinion
was
adopted
unanimously
they
declared
it
so
loudly
and
vociferated--'a
miracle
a
miracle'--with
such
fervour
that
they
soon
interrupted
ambrosio's
slumbers
the
monks
immediately
crowded
round
his
bed
and
expressed
their
satisfaction
at
his
wonderful
recovery
he
was
perfectly
in
his
senses
and
free
from
every
complaint
except
feeling
weak
and
languid
pablos
gave
him
a
strengthening
medicine
and
advised
his
keeping
his
bed
for
the
two
succeeding
days
he
then
retired
having
desired
his
patient
not
to
exhaust
himself
by
conversation
but
rather
to
endeavour
at
taking
some
repose
the
other
monks
followed
his
example
and
the
abbot
and
rosario
were
left
without
observers
for
some
minutes
ambrosio
regarded
his
attendant
with
a
look
of
mingled
pleasure
and
apprehension
she
was
seated
upon
the
side
of
the
bed
her
head
bending
down
and
as
usual
enveloped
in
the
cowl
of
her
habit
'and
you
are
still
here
matilda'
said
the
friar
at
length
'are
you
not
satisfied
with
having
so
nearly
effected
my
destruction
that
nothing
but
a
miracle
could
have
saved
me
from
the
grave
ah
surely
heaven
sent
that
serpent
to
punish'
matilda
interrupted
him
by
putting
her
hand
before
his
lips
with
an
air
of
gaiety
'hush
father
hush
you
must
not
talk'
'he
who
imposed
that
order
knew
not
how
interesting
are
the
subjects
on
which
i
wish
to
speak'
'but
i
know
it
and
yet
issue
the
same
positive
command
i
am
appointed
your
nurse
and
you
must
not
disobey
my
orders'
'you
are
in
spirits
matilda'
'well
may
i
be
so
i
have
just
received
a
pleasure
unexampled
through
my
whole
life'
'what
was
that
pleasure'
'what
i
must
conceal
from
all
but
most
from
you'
'but
most
from
me
nay
then
i
entreat
you
matilda'
'hush
father
hush
you
must
not
talk
but
as
you
do
not
seem
inclined
to
sleep
shall
i
endeavour
to
amuse
you
with
my
harp'
'how
i
knew
not
that
you
understood
music'
'oh
i
am
a
sorry
performer
yet
as
silence
is
prescribed
you
for
eight
and
forty
hours
i
may
possibly
entertain
you
when
wearied
of
your
own
reflections
i
go
to
fetch
my
harp'
she
soon
returned
with
it
'now
father
what
shall
i
sing
will
you
hear
the
ballad
which
treats
of
the
gallant
durandarte
who
died
in
the
famous
battle
of
roncevalles'
'what
you
please
matilda'
'oh
call
me
not
matilda
call
me
rosario
call
me
your
friend
those
are
the
names
which
i
love
to
hear
from
your
lips
now
listen'
she
then
tuned
her
harp
and
afterwards
preluded
for
some
moments
with
such
exquisite
taste
as
to
prove
her
a
perfect
mistress
of
the
instrument
the
air
which
she
played
was
soft
and
plaintive
ambrosio
while
he
listened
felt
his
uneasiness
subside
and
a
pleasing
melancholy
spread
itself
into
his
bosom
suddenly
matilda
changed
the
strain
with
an
hand
bold
and
rapid
she
struck
a
few
loud
martial
chords
and
then
chaunted
the
following
ballad
to
an
air
at
once
simple
and
melodious
durandarte
and
belerma
sad
and
fearful
is
the
story
of
the
roncevalles
fight
on
those
fatal
plains
of
glory
perished
many
a
gallant
knight
there
fell
durandarte
never
verse
a
nobler
chieftain
named
he
before
his
lips
for
ever
closed
in
silence
thus
exclaimed
'oh
belerma
oh
my
dear-one
for
my
pain
and
pleasure
born
seven
long
years
i
served
thee
fair-one
seven
long
years
my
fee
was
scorn
'and
when
now
thy
heart
replying
to
my
wishes
burns
like
mine
cruel
fate
my
bliss
denying
bids
me
every
hope
resign
'ah
though
young
i
fall
believe
me
death
would
never
claim
a
sigh
'tis
to
lose
thee
'tis
to
leave
thee
makes
me
think
it
hard
to
die
'oh
my
cousin
montesinos
by
that
friendship
firm
and
dear
which
from
youth
has
lived
between
us
now
my
last
petition
hear
'when
my
soul
these
limbs
forsaking
eager
seeks
a
purer

from
my
breast
the
cold
heart
taking
give
it
to
belerma's
care
say
i
of
my
lands
possessor
named
her
with
my
dying
breath
say
my
lips
i
op'd
to
bless
her
ere
they
closed
for
aye
in
death
'twice
a
week
too
how
sincerely
i
adored
her
cousin
say
twice
a
week
for
one
who
dearly
loved
her
cousin
bid
her
pray
'montesinos
now
the
hour
marked
by
fate
is
near
at
hand
lo
my
arm
has
lost
its
power
lo
i
drop
my
trusty
brand
'eyes
which
forth
beheld
me
going
homewards
ne'er
shall
see
me
hie
cousin
stop
those
tears
o'er-flowing
let
me
on
thy
bosom
die
'thy
kind
hand
my
eyelids
closing
yet

i
implore
pray
thou
for
my
soul's
reposing
when
my
heart
shall
throb
no
more
'so
shall
jesus
still
attending
gracious
to
a
christian's
vow
pleased
accept
my
ghost
ascending
and
a
seat
in
heaven
allow'
thus
spoke
gallant
durandarte
soon
his
brave
heart
broke
in
twain
greatly
joyed
the
moorish
party
that
the
gallant
knight
was
slain
bitter
weeping
montesinos
took
from
him
his
helm
and
glaive
bitter
weeping
montesinos
dug
his
gallant
cousin's
grave
to
perform
his
promise
made
he
cut
the
heart
from
out
the
breast
that
belerma
wretched
lady
might
receive
the
last
bequest
sad
was
montesinos'
heart
he
felt
distress
his
bosom
rend
'oh
my
cousin
durandarte
woe
is
me
to
view
thy
end
'sweet
in
manners
fair
in
favour
mild
in
temper
fierce
in
fight
warrior
nobler
gentler
braver
never
shall
behold
the
light
'cousin
lo
my
tears
bedew
thee
how
shall
i
thy
loss
survive
durandarte
he
who
slew
thee
wherefore
left
he
me
alive'
while
she
sung
ambrosio
listened
with
delight
never
had
he
heard
a
voice
more
harmonious
and
he
wondered
how
such
heavenly
sounds
could
be
produced
by
any
but
angels
but
though
he
indulged
the
sense
of
hearing
a
single
look
convinced
him
that
he
must
not
trust
to
that
of
sight
the
songstress
sat
at
a
little
distance
from
his
bed
the
attitude
in
which
she
bent
over
her
harp
was
easy
and
graceful
her
cowl
had
fallen
backwarder
than
usual
two
coral
lips
were
visible
ripe
fresh
and
melting
and
a
chin
in
whose
dimples
seemed
to
lurk
a
thousand
cupids
her
habit's
long
sleeve
would
have
swept
along
the
chords
of
the
instrument
to
prevent
this
inconvenience
she
had
drawn
it
above
her
elbow
and
by
this
means
an
arm
was
discovered
formed
in
the
most
perfect
symmetry
the
delicacy
of
whose
skin
might
have
contended
with
snow
in
whiteness
ambrosio
dared
to
look
on
her
but
once
that
glance
sufficed
to
convince
him
how
dangerous
was
the
presence
of
this
seducing
object
he
closed
his
eyes
but
strove
in
vain
to
banish
her
from
his
thoughts
there
she
still
moved
before
him
adorned
with
all
those
charms
which
his
heated
imagination
could
supply
every
beauty
which
he
had
seen
appeared
embellished
and
those
still
concealed
fancy
represented
to
him
in
glowing
colours
still
however
his
vows
and
the
necessity
of
keeping
to
them
were
present
to
his
memory
he
struggled
with
desire
and
shuddered
when
he
beheld
how
deep
was
the
precipice
before
him
matilda
ceased
to
sing
dreading
the
influence
of
her
charms
ambrosio
remained
with
his
eyes
closed
and
offered
up
his
prayers
to
st
francis
to
assist
him
in
this
dangerous
trial
matilda
believed
that
he
was
sleeping
she
rose
from
her
seat
approached
the
bed
softly
and
for
some
minutes
gazed
upon
him
attentively
'he
sleeps'
said
she
at
length
in
a
low
voice
but
whose
accents
the
abbot
distinguished
perfectly
'now
then
i
may
gaze
upon
him
without
offence
i
may
mix
my
breath
with
his
i
may
doat
upon
his
features
and
he
cannot
suspect
me
of
impurity
and
deceit--he
fears
my
seducing
him
to
the
violation
of
his
vows
oh
the
unjust
were
it
my
wish
to
excite
desire
should
i
conceal
my
features
from
him
so
carefully
those
features
of
which
i
daily
hear
him'
she
stopped
and
was
lost
in
her
reflections
'it
was
but
yesterday'
she
continued
'but
a
few
short
hours
have
past
since
i
was
dear
to
him
he
esteemed
me
and
my
heart
was
satisfied
now
oh
now
how
cruelly
is
my
situation
changed
he
looks
on
me
with
suspicion
he
bids
me
leave
him
leave
him
for
ever
oh
you
my
saint
my
idol
you
holding
the
next
place
to
god
in
my
breast
yet
two
days
and
my
heart
will
be
unveiled
to
you--could
you
know
my
feelings
when
i
beheld
your
agony
could
you
know
how
much
your
sufferings
have
endeared
you
to
me
but
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
be
convinced
that
my
passion
is
pure
and
disinterested
then
you
will
pity
me
and
feel
the
whole
weight
of
these
sorrows'
as
she
said
this
her
voice
was
choaked
by
weeping
while
she
bent
over
ambrosio
a
tear
fell
upon
his
cheek
'ah
i
have
disturbed
him'
cried
matilda
and
retreated
hastily
her
alarm
was
ungrounded
none
sleep
so
profoundly
as
those
who
are
determined
not
to
wake
the
friar
was
in
this
predicament
he
still
seemed
buried
in
a
repose
which
every
succeeding
minute
rendered
him
less
capable
of
enjoying
the
burning
tear
had
communicated
its
warmth
to
his
heart
'what
affection
what
purity'
said
he
internally
'ah
since
my
bosom
is
thus
sensible
of
pity
what
would
it
be
if
agitated
by
love'
matilda
again
quitted
her
seat
and
retired
to
some
distance
from
the
bed
ambrosio
ventured
to
open
his
eyes
and
to
cast
them
upon
her
fearfully
her
face
was
turned
from
him
she
rested
her
head
in
a
melancholy
posture
upon
her
harp
and
gazed
on
the
picture
which
hung
opposite
to
the
bed
'happy
happy
image'
thus
did
she
address
the
beautiful
madona
''tis
to
you
that
he
offers
his
prayers
'tis
on
you
that
he
gazes
with
admiration
i
thought
you
would
have
lightened
my
sorrows
you
have
only
served
to
increase
their
weight
you
have
made
me
feel
that
had
i
known
him
ere
his
vows
were
pronounced
ambrosio
and
happiness
might
have
been
mine
with
what
pleasure
he
views
this
picture
with
what
fervour
he
addresses
his
prayers
to
the
insensible
image
ah
may
not
his
sentiments
be
inspired
by
some
kind
and
secret
genius
friend
to
my
affection
may
it
not
be
man's
natural
instinct
which
informs
him
be
silent
idle
hopes
let
me
not
encourage
an
idea
which
takes
from
the
brilliance
of
ambrosio's
virtue
'tis
religion
not
beauty
which
attracts
his
admiration
'tis
not
to
the
woman
but
the
divinity
that
he
kneels
would
he
but
address
to
me
the
least
tender
expression
which
he
pours
forth
to
this
madona
would
he
but
say
that
were
he
not
already
affianced
to
the
church
he
would
not
have
despised
matilda
oh
let
me
nourish
that
fond
idea
perhaps
he
may
yet
acknowledge
that
he
feels
for
me
more
than
pity
and
that
affection
like
mine
might
well
have
deserved
a
return
perhaps
he
may
own
thus
much
when
i
lye
on
my
deathbed
he
then
need
not
fear
to
infringe
his
vows
and
the
confession
of
his
regard
will
soften
the
pangs
of
dying
would
i
were
sure
of
this
oh
how
earnestly
should
i
sigh
for
the
moment
of
dissolution'
of
this
discourse
the
abbot
lost
not
a
syllable
and
the
tone
in
which
she
pronounced
these
last
words
pierced
to
his
heart
involuntarily
he
raised
himself
from
his
pillow
'matilda'
he
said
in
a
troubled
voice
'oh
my
matilda'
she
started
at
the
sound
and
turned
towards
him
hastily
the
suddenness
of
her
movement
made
her
cowl
fall
back
from
her
head
her
features
became
visible
to
the
monk's
enquiring
eye
what
was
his
amazement
at
beholding
the
exact
resemblance
of
his
admired
madona
the
same
exquisite
proportion
of
features
the
same
profusion
of
golden
hair
the
same
rosy
lips
heavenly
eyes
and
majesty
of
countenance
adorned
matilda
uttering
an
exclamation
of
surprize
ambrosio
sank
back
upon
his
pillow
and
doubted
whether
the
object
before
him
was
mortal
or
divine
matilda
seemed
penetrated
with
confusion
she
remained
motionless
in
her
place
and
supported
herself
upon
her
instrument
her
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
earth
and
her
fair
cheeks
overspread
with
blushes
on
recovering
herself
her
first
action
was
to
conceal
her
features
she
then
in
an
unsteady
and
troubled
voice
ventured
to
address
these
words
to
the
friar
'accident
has
made
you
master
of
a
secret
which
i
never
would
have
revealed
but
on
the
bed
of
death
yes
ambrosio
in
matilda
de
villanegas
you
see
the
original
of
your
beloved
madona
soon
after
i
conceived
my
unfortunate
passion
i
formed
the
project
of
conveying
to
you
my
picture
crowds
of
admirers
had
persuaded
me
that
i
possessed
some
beauty
and
i
was
anxious
to
know
what
effect
it
would
produce
upon
you
i
caused
my
portrait
to
be
drawn
by
martin
galuppi
a
celebrated
venetian
at
that
time
resident
in
madrid
the
resemblance
was
striking
i
sent
it
to
the
capuchin
abbey
as
if
for
sale
and
the
jew
from
whom
you
bought
it
was
one
of
my
emissaries
you
purchased
it
judge
of
my
rapture
when
informed
that
you
had
gazed
upon
it
with
delight
or
rather
with
adoration
that
you
had
suspended
it
in
your
cell
and
that
you
addressed
your
supplications
to
no
other
saint
will
this
discovery
make
me
still
more
regarded
as
an
object
of
suspicion
rather
should
it
convince
you
how
pure
is
my
affection
and
engage
you
to
suffer
me
in
your
society
and
esteem
i
heard
you
daily
extol
the
praises
of
my
portrait
i
was
an
eyewitness
of
the
transports
which
its
beauty
excited
in
you
yet
i
forbore
to
use
against
your
virtue
those
arms
with
which
yourself
had
furnished
me
i
concealed
those
features
from
your
sight
which
you
loved
unconsciously
i
strove
not
to
excite
desire
by
displaying
my
charms
or
to
make
myself
mistress
of
your
heart
through
the
medium
of
your
senses
to
attract
your
notice
by
studiously
attending
to
religious
duties
to
endear
myself
to
you
by
convincing
you
that
my
mind
was
virtuous
and
my
attachment
sincere
such
was
my
only
aim
i
succeeded
i
became
your
companion
and
your
friend
i
concealed
my
sex
from
your
knowledge
and
had
you
not
pressed
me
to
reveal
my
secret
had
i
not
been
tormented
by
the
fear
of
a
discovery
never
had
you
known
me
for
any
other
than
rosario
and
still
are
you
resolved
to
drive
me
from
you
the
few
hours
of
life
which
yet
remain
for
me
may
i
not
pass
them
in
your
presence
oh
speak
ambrosio
and
tell
me
that
i
may
stay'
this
speech
gave
the
abbot
an
opportunity
of
recollecting
himself
he
was
conscious
that
in
the
present
disposition
of
his
mind
avoiding
her
society
was
his
only
refuge
from
the
power
of
this
enchanting
woman
'you
declaration
has
so
much
astonished
me'
said
he
'that
i
am
at
present
incapable
of
answering
you
do
not
insist
upon
a
reply
matilda
leave
me
to
myself
i
have
need
to
be
alone'
'i
obey
you--but
before
i
go
promise
not
to
insist
upon
my
quitting
the
abbey
immediately'
'matilda
reflect
upon
your
situation
reflect
upon
the
consequences
of
your
stay
our
separation
is
indispensable
and
we
must
part'
'but
not
to-day
father
oh
in
pity
not
today'
'you
press
me
too
hard
but
i
cannot
resist
that
tone
of
supplication
since
you
insist
upon
it
i
yield
to
your
prayer
i
consent
to
your
remaining
here
a
sufficient
time
to
prepare
in
some
measure
the
brethren
for
your
departure
stay
yet
two
days
but
on
the
third'

he
sighed
involuntarily--'remember
that
on
the
third
we
must
part
for
ever'
she
caught
his
hand
eagerly
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
'on
the
third'
she
exclaimed
with
an
air
of
wild
solemnity
'you
are
right
father
you
are
right
on
the
third
we
must
part
for
ever'
there
was
a
dreadful
expression
in
her
eye
as
she
uttered
these
words
which
penetrated
the
friar's
soul
with
horror
again
she
kissed
his
hand
and
then
fled
with
rapidity
from
the
chamber
anxious
to
authorise
the
presence
of
his
dangerous
guest
yet
conscious
that
her
stay
was
infringing
the
laws
of
his
order
ambrosio's
bosom
became
the
theatre
of
a
thousand
contending
passions
at
length
his
attachment
to
the
feigned
rosario
aided
by
the
natural
warmth
of
his
temperament
seemed
likely
to
obtain
the
victory
the
success
was
assured
when
that
presumption
which
formed
the
groundwork
of
his
character
came
to
matilda's
assistance
the
monk
reflected
that
to
vanquish
temptation
was
an
infinitely
greater
merit
than
to
avoid
it
he
thought
that
he
ought
rather
to
rejoice
in
the
opportunity
given
him
of
proving
the
firmness
of
his
virtue
st
anthony
had
withstood
all
seductions
to
lust
then
why
should
not
he
besides
st
anthony
was
tempted
by
the
devil
who
put
every
art
into
practice
to
excite
his
passions
whereas
ambrosio's
danger
proceeded
from
a
mere
mortal
woman
fearful
and
modest
whose
apprehensions
of
his
yielding
were
not
less
violent
than
his
own
'yes'
said
he
'the
unfortunate
shall
stay
i
have
nothing
to
fear
from
her
presence
even
should
my
own
prove
too
weak
to
resist
the
temptation
i
am
secured
from
danger
by
the
innocence
of
matilda'
ambrosio
was
yet
to
learn
that
to
an
heart
unacquainted
with
her
vice
is
ever
most
dangerous
when
lurking
behind
the
mask
of
virtue
he
found
himself
so
perfectly
recovered
that
when
father
pablos
visited
him
again
at
night
he
entreated
permission
to
quit
his
chamber
on
the
day
following
his
request
was
granted
matilda
appeared
no
more
that
evening
except
in
company
with
the
monks
when
they
came
in
a
body
to
enquire
after
the
abbot's
health
she
seemed
fearful
of
conversing
with
him
in
private
and
stayed
but
a
few
minutes
in
his
room
the
friar
slept
well
but
the
dreams
of
the
former
night
were
repeated
and
his
sensations
of
voluptuousness
were
yet
more
keen
and
exquisite
the
same
lust-exciting
visions
floated
before
his
eyes
matilda
in
all
the
pomp
of
beauty
warm
tender
and
luxurious
clasped
him
to
her
bosom
and
lavished
upon
him
the
most
ardent
caresses
he
returned
them
as
eagerly
and
already
was
on
the
point
of
satisfying
his
desires
when
the
faithless
form
disappeared
and
left
him
to
all
the
horrors
of
shame
and
disappointment
the
morning
dawned
fatigued
harassed
and
exhausted
by
his
provoking
dreams
he
was
not
disposed
to
quit
his
bed
he
excused
himself
from
appearing
at
matins
it
was
the
first
morning
in
his
life
that
he
had
ever
missed
them
he
rose
late
during
the
whole
of
the
day
he
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
matilda
without
witnesses
his
cell
was
thronged
by
the
monks
anxious
to
express
their
concern
at
his
illness
and
he
was
still
occupied
in
receiving
their
compliments
on
his
recovery
when
the
bell
summoned
them
to
the
refectory
after
dinner
the
monks
separated
and
dispersed
themselves
in
various
parts
of
the
garden
where
the
shade
of
trees
or
retirement
of
some
grotto
presented
the
most
agreeable
means
of
enjoying
the
siesta
the
abbot
bent
his
steps
towards
the
hermitage
a
glance
of
his
eye
invited
matilda
to
accompany
him
she
obeyed
and
followed
him
thither
in
silence
they
entered
the
grotto
and
seated
themselves
both
seemed
unwilling
to
begin
the
conversation
and
to
labour
under
the
influence
of
mutual
embarrassment
at
length
the
abbot
spoke
he
conversed
only
on
indifferent
topics
and
matilda
answered
him
in
the
same
tone
she
seemed
anxious
to
make
him
forget
that
the
person
who
sat
by
him
was
any
other
than
rosario
neither
of
them
dared
or
indeed
wished
to
make
an
allusion
to
the
subject
which
was
most
at
the
hearts
of
both
matilda's
efforts
to
appear
gay
were
evidently
forced
her
spirits
were
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
anxiety
and
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
low
and
feeble
she
seemed
desirous
of
finishing
a
conversation
which
embarrassed
her
and
complaining
that
she
was
unwell
she
requested
ambrosio's
permission
to
return
to
the
abbey
he
accompanied
her
to
the
door
of
her
cell
and
when
arrived
there
he
stopped
her
to
declare
his
consent
to
her
continuing
the
partner
of
his
solitude
so
long
as
should
be
agreeable
to
herself
she
discovered
no
marks
of
pleasure
at
receiving
this
intelligence
though
on
the
preceding
day
she
had
been
so
anxious
to
obtain
the
permission
'alas
father'
she
said
waving
her
head
mournfully
'your
kindness
comes
too
late
my
doom
is
fixed
we
must
separate
for
ever
yet
believe
that
i
am
grateful
for
your
generosity
for
your
compassion
of
an
unfortunate
who
is
but
too
little
deserving
of
it'
she
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
her
cowl
was
only
half
drawn
over
her
face
ambrosio
observed
that
she
was
pale
and
her
eyes
sunk
and
heavy
'good
god'
he
cried
'you
are
very
ill
matilda
i
shall
send
father
pablos
to
you
instantly'
'no
do
not
i
am
ill
'tis
true
but
he
cannot
cure
my
malady
farewell
father
remember
me
in
your
prayers
tomorrow
while
i
shall
remember
you
in
heaven'
she
entered
her
cell
and
closed
the
door
the
abbot
dispatched
to
her
the
physician
without
losing
a
moment
and
waited
his
report
impatiently
but
father
pablos
soon
returned
and
declared
that
his
errand
had
been
fruitless
rosario
refused
to
admit
him
and
had
positively
rejected
his
offers
of
assistance
the
uneasiness
which
this
account
gave
ambrosio
was
not
trifling
yet
he
determined
that
matilda
should
have
her
own
way
for
that
night
but
that
if
her
situation
did
not
mend
by
the
morning
he
would
insist
upon
her
taking
the
advice
of
father
pablos
he
did
not
find
himself
inclined
to
sleep
he
opened
his
casement
and
gazed
upon
the
moonbeams
as
they
played
upon
the
small
stream
whose
waters
bathed
the
walls
of
the
monastery
the
coolness
of
the
night
breeze
and
tranquillity
of
the
hour
inspired
the
friar's
mind
with
sadness
he
thought
upon
matilda's
beauty
and
affection
upon
the
pleasures
which
he
might
have
shared
with
her
had
he
not
been
restrained
by
monastic
fetters
he
reflected
that
unsustained
by
hope
her
love
for
him
could
not
long
exist
that
doubtless
she
would
succeed
in
extinguishing
her
passion
and
seek
for
happiness
in
the
arms
of
one
more
fortunate
he
shuddered
at
the
void
which
her
absence
would
leave
in
his
bosom
he
looked
with
disgust
on
the
monotony
of
a
convent
and
breathed
a
sigh
towards
that
world
from
which
he
was
for
ever
separated
such
were
the
reflections
which
a
loud
knocking
at
his
door
interrupted
the
bell
of
the
church
had
already
struck
two
the
abbot
hastened
to
enquire
the
cause
of
this
disturbance
he
opened
the
door
of
his
cell
and
a
lay-brother
entered
whose
looks
declared
his
hurry
and
confusion
'hasten
reverend
father'
said
he
'hasten
to
the
young
rosario
he
earnestly
requests
to
see
you
he
lies
at
the
point
of
death'
'gracious
god
where
is
father
pablos
why
is
he
not
with
him
oh
i
fear
i
fear'
'father
pablos
has
seen
him
but
his
art
can
do
nothing
he
says
that
he
suspects
the
youth
to
be
poisoned'
'poisoned
oh
the
unfortunate
it
is
then
as
i
suspected
but
let
me
not
lose
a
moment
perhaps
it
may
yet
be
time
to
save
her'
he
said
and
flew
towards
the
cell
of
the
novice
several
monks
were
already
in
the
chamber
father
pablos
was
one
of
them
and
held
a
medicine
in
his
hand
which
he
was
endeavouring
to
persuade
rosario
to
swallow
the
others
were
employed
in
admiring
the
patient's
divine
countenance
which
they
now
saw
for
the
first
time
she
looked
lovelier
than
ever
she
was
no
longer
pale
or
languid
a
bright
glow
had
spread
itself
over
her
cheeks
her
eyes
sparkled
with
a
serene
delight
and
her
countenance
was
expressive
of
confidence
and
resignation
'oh
torment
me
no
more'
was
she
saying
to
pablos
when
the
terrified
abbot
rushed
hastily
into
the
cell
'my
disease
is
far
beyond
the
reach
of
your
skill
and
i
wish
not
to
be
cured
of
it'--then
perceiving
ambrosio--
'ah
'tis
he'
she
cried
'i
see
him
once
again
before
we
part
for
ever
leave
me
my
brethren
much
have
i
to
tell
this
holy
man
in
private'
the
monks
retired
immediately
and
matilda
and
the
abbot
remained
together
'what
have
you
done
imprudent
woman'
exclaimed
the
latter
as
soon
as
they
were
left
alone
'tell
me
are
my
suspicions
just
am
i
indeed
to
lose
you
has
your
own
hand
been
the
instrument
of
your
destruction'
she
smiled
and
grasped
his
hand
'in
what
have
i
been
imprudent
father
i
have
sacrificed
a
pebble
and
saved
a
diamond
my
death
preserves
a
life
valuable
to
the
world
and
more
dear
to
me
than
my
own
yes
father
i
am
poisoned
but
know
that
the
poison
once
circulated
in
your
veins'
'matilda'
'what
i
tell
you
i
resolved
never
to
discover
to
you
but
on
the
bed
of
death
that
moment
is
now
arrived
you
cannot
have
forgotten
the
day
already
when
your
life
was
endangered
by
the
bite
of
a
cientipedoro
the
physician
gave
you
over
declaring
himself
ignorant
how
to
extract
the
venom
i
knew
but
of
one
means
and
hesitated
not
a
moment
to
employ
it
i
was
left
alone
with
you
you
slept
i
loosened
the
bandage
from
your
hand
i
kissed
the
wound
and
drew
out
the
poison
with
my
lips
the
effect
has
been
more
sudden
than
i
expected
i
feel
death
at
my
heart
yet
an
hour
and
i
shall
be
in
a
better
world'
'almighty
god'
exclaimed
the
abbot
and
sank
almost
lifeless
upon
the
bed
after
a
few
minutes
he
again
raised
himself
up
suddenly
and
gazed
upon
matilda
with
all
the
wildness
of
despair
'and
you
have
sacrificed
yourself
for
me
you
die
and
die
to
preserve
ambrosio
and
is
there
indeed
no
remedy
matilda
and
is
there
indeed
no
hope
speak
to
me
oh
speak
to
me
tell
me
that
you
have
still
the
means
of
life'
'be
comforted
my
only
friend
yes
i
have
still
the
means
of
life
in
my
power
but
'tis
a
means
which
i
dare
not
employ
it
is
dangerous
it
is
dreadful
life
would
be
purchased
at
too
dear
a
rate

unless
it
were
permitted
me
to
live
for
you'
'then
live
for
me
matilda
for
me
and
gratitude'--
he
caught
her
hand
and
pressed
it
rapturously
to
his
lips--'remember
our
late
conversations
i
now
consent
to
every
thing
remember
in
what
lively
colours
you
described
the
union
of
souls
be
it
ours
to
realize
those
ideas
let
us
forget
the
distinctions
of
sex
despise
the
world's
prejudices
and
only
consider
each
other
as
brother
and
friend
live
then
matilda
oh
live
for
me'
'ambrosio
it
must
not
be
when
i
thought
thus
i
deceived
both
you
and
myself
either
i
must
die
at
present
or
expire
by
the
lingering
torments
of
unsatisfied
desire
oh
since
we
last
conversed
together
a
dreadful
veil
has
been
rent
from
before
my
eyes
i
love
you
no
longer
with
the
devotion
which
is
paid
to
a
saint
i
prize
you
no
more
for
the
virtues
of
your
soul
i
lust
for
the
enjoyment
of
your
person
the
woman
reigns
in
my
bosom
and
i
am
become
a
prey
to
the
wildest
of
passions
away
with
friendship
'tis
a
cold
unfeeling
word
my
bosom
burns
with
love
with
unutterable
love
and
love
must
be
its
return
tremble
then
ambrosio
tremble
to
succeed
in
your
prayers
if
i
live
your
truth
your
reputation
your
reward
of
a
life
past
in
sufferings
all
that
you
value
is
irretrievably
lost
i
shall
no
longer
be
able
to
combat
my
passions
shall
seize
every
opportunity
to
excite
your
desires
and
labour
to
effect
your
dishonour
and
my
own
no
no
ambrosio
i
must
not
live
i
am
convinced
with
every
moment
that
i
have
but
one
alternative
i
feel
with
every
heart-throb
that
i
must
enjoy
you
or
die'
'amazement--matilda
can
it
be
you
who
speak
to
me'
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
quit
his
seat
she
uttered
a
loud
shriek
and
raising
herself
half
out
of
the
bed
threw
her
arms
round
the
friar
to
detain
him
'oh
do
not
leave
me
listen
to
my
errors
with
compassion
in
a
few
hours
i
shall
be
no
more
yet
a
little
and
i
am
free
from
this
disgraceful
passion'
'wretched
woman
what
can
i
say
to
you
i
cannot

i
must
not

but
live
matilda
oh
live'
'you
do
not
reflect
on
what
you
ask
what
live
to
plunge
myself
in
infamy
to
become
the
agent
of
hell
to
work
the
destruction
both
of
you
and
of
myself
feel
this
heart
father'
she
took
his
hand
confused
embarrassed
and
fascinated
he
withdrew
it
not
and
felt
her
heart
throb
under
it
'feel
this
heart
father
it
is
yet
the
seat
of
honour
truth
and
chastity
if
it
beats
tomorrow
it
must
fall
a
prey
to
the
blackest
crimes
oh
let
me
then
die
today
let
me
die
while
i
yet
deserve
the
tears
of
the
virtuous
thus
will
expire'--she
reclined
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
her
golden
hair
poured
itself
over
his
chest--
'folded
in
your
arms
i
shall
sink
to
sleep
your
hand
shall
close
my
eyes
for
ever
and
your
lips
receive
my
dying
breath
and
will
you
not
sometimes
think
of
me
will
you
not
sometimes
shed
a
tear
upon
my
tomb
oh
yes
yes
yes
that
kiss
is
my
assurance'
the
hour
was
night
all
was
silence
around
the
faint
beams
of
a
solitary
lamp
darted
upon
matilda's
figure
and
shed
through
the
chamber
a
dim
mysterious
light
no
prying
eye
or
curious
ear
was
near
the
lovers
nothing
was
heard
but
matilda's
melodious
accents
ambrosio
was
in
the
full
vigour
of
manhood
he
saw
before
him
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
the
preserver
of
his
life
the
adorer
of
his
person
and
whom
affection
for
him
had
reduced
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
he
sat
upon
her
bed
his
hand
rested
upon
her
bosom
her
head
reclined
voluptuously
upon
his
breast
who
then
can
wonder
if
he
yielded
to
the
temptation
drunk
with
desire
he
pressed
his
lips
to
those
which
sought
them
his
kisses
vied
with
matilda's
in
warmth
and
passion
he
clasped
her
rapturously
in
his
arms
he
forgot
his
vows
his
sanctity
and
his
fame
he
remembered
nothing
but
the
pleasure
and
opportunity
'ambrosio
oh
my
ambrosio'
sighed
matilda
'thine
ever
thine'
murmured
the
friar
and
sank
upon
her
bosom
----these
are
the
villains
whom
all
the
travellers
do
fear
so
much
--------some
of
them
are
gentlemen

as
the
fury
of
ungoverned
youth
thrust
from
the
company
of
awful
men
two
gentlemen
of
verona
the
marquis
and
lorenzo
proceeded
to
the
hotel
in
silence
the
former
employed
himself
in
calling
every
circumstance
to
his
mind
which
related
might
give
lorenzo's
the
most
favourable
idea
of
his
connexion
with
agnes
the
latter
justly
alarmed
for
the
honour
of
his
family
felt
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
the
marquis
the
adventure
which
he
had
just
witnessed
forbad
his
treating
him
as
a
friend
and
antonia's
interests
being
entrusted
to
his
mediation
he
saw
the
impolicy
of
treating
him
as
a
foe
he
concluded
from
these
reflections
that
profound
silence
would
be
the
wisest
plan
and
waited
with
impatience
for
don
raymond's
explanation
they
arrived
at
the
hotel
de
las
cisternas
the
marquis
immediately
conducted
him
to
his
apartment
and
began
to
express
his
satisfaction
at
finding
him
at
madrid
lorenzo
interrupted
him
'excuse
me
my
lord'
said
he
with
a
distant
air
'if
i
reply
somewhat
coldly
to
your
expressions
of
regard
a
sister's
honour
is
involved
in
this
affair
till
that
is
established
and
the
purport
of
your
correspondence
with
agnes
cleared
up
i
cannot
consider
you
as
my
friend
i
am
anxious
to
hear
the
meaning
of
your
conduct
and
hope
that
you
will
not
delay
the
promised
explanation'
'first
give
me
your
word
that
you
will
listen
with
patience
and
indulgence'
'i
love
my
sister
too
well
to
judge
her
harshly
and
till
this
moment
i
possessed
no
friend
so
dear
to
me
as
yourself
i
will
also
confess
that
your
having
it
in
your
power
to
oblige
me
in
a
business
which
i
have
much
at
heart
makes
me
very
anxious
to
find
you
still
deserving
my
esteem'
'lorenzo
you
transport
me
no
greater
pleasure
can
be
given
me
than
an
opportunity
of
serving
the
brother
of
agnes'
'convince
me
that
i
can
accept
your
favours
without
dishonour
and
there
is
no
man
in
the
world
to
whom
i
am
more
willing
to
be
obliged'
'probably
you
have
already
heard
your
sister
mention
the
name
of
alphonso
d'alvarada'
'never
though
i
feel
for
agnes
an
affection
truly
fraternal
circumstances
have
prevented
us
from
being
much
together
while
yet
a
child
she
was
consigned
to
the
care
of
her
aunt
who
had
married
a
german
nobleman
at
his
castle
she
remained
till
two
years
since
when
she
returned
to
spain
determined
upon
secluding
herself
from
the
world'
'good
god
lorenzo
you
knew
of
her
intention
and
yet
strove
not
to
make
her
change
it'
'marquis
you
wrong
me
the
intelligence
which
i
received
at
naples
shocked
me
extremely
and
i
hastened
my
return
to
madrid
for
the
express
purpose
of
preventing
the
sacrifice
the
moment
that
i
arrived
i
flew
to
the
convent
of
st
clare
in
which
agnes
had
chosen
to
perform
her
noviciate
i
requested
to
see
my
sister
conceive
my
surprise
when
she
sent
me
a
refusal
she
declared
positively
that
apprehending
my
influence
over
her
mind
she
would
not
trust
herself
in
my
society
till
the
day
before
that
on
which
she
was
to
receive
the
veil
i
supplicated
the
nuns
i
insisted
upon
seeing
agnes
and
hesitated
not
to
avow
my
suspicions
that
her
being
kept
from
me
was
against
her
own
inclinations
to
free
herself
from
the
imputation
of
violence
the
prioress
brought
me
a
few
lines
written
in
my
sister's
well-known
hand
repeating
the
message
already
delivered
all
future
attempts
to
obtain
a
moment's
conversation
with
her
were
as
fruitless
as
the
first
she
was
inflexible
and
i
was
not
permitted
to
see
her
till
the
day
preceding
that
on
which
she
entered
the
cloister
never
to
quit
it
more
this
interview
took
place
in
the
presence
of
our
principal
relations
it
was
for
the
first
time
since
her
childhood
that
i
saw
her
and
the
scene
was
most
affecting
she
threw
herself
upon
my
bosom
kissed
me
and
wept
bitterly
by
every
possible
argument
by
tears
by
prayers
by
kneeling
i
strove
to
make
her
abandon
her
intention
i
represented
to
her
all
the
hardships
of
a
religious
life
i
painted
to
her
imagination
all
the
pleasures
which
she
was
going
to
quit
and
besought
her
to
disclose
to
me
what
occasioned
her
disgust
to
the
world
at
this
last
question
she
turned
pale
and
her
tears
flowed
yet
faster
she
entreated
me
not
to
press
her
on
that
subject
that
it
sufficed
me
to
know
that
her
resolution
was
taken
and
that
a
convent
was
the
only
place
where
she
could
now
hope
for
tranquillity
she
persevered
in
her
design
and
made
her
profession
i
visited
her
frequently
at
the
grate
and
every
moment
that
i
passed
with
her
made
me
feel
more
affliction
at
her
loss
i
was
shortly
after
obliged
to
quit
madrid
i
returned
but
yesterday
evening
and
since
then
have
not
had
time
to
call
at
st
clare's
convent'
'then
till
i
mentioned
it
you
never
heard
the
name
of
alphonso
d'alvarada'
'pardon
me
my
aunt
wrote
me
word
that
an
adventurer
so
called
had
found
means
to
get
introduced
into
the
castle
of
lindenberg
that
he
had
insinuated
himself
into
my
sister's
good
graces
and
that
she
had
even
consented
to
elope
with
him
however
before
the
plan
could
be
executed
the
cavalier
discovered
that
the
estates
which
he
believed
agnes
to
possess
in
hispaniola
in
reality
belonged
to
me
this
intelligence
made
him
change
his
intention
he
disappeared
on
the
day
that
the
elopement
was
to
have
taken
place
and
agnes
in
despair
at
his
perfidy
and
meanness
had
resolved
upon
seclusion
in
a
convent
she
added
that
as
this
adventurer
had
given
himself
out
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
she
wished
to
know
whether
i
had
any
knowledge
of
him
i
replied
in
the
negative
i
had
then
very
little
idea
that
alphonso
d'alvarada
and
the
marquis
de
las
cisternas
were
one
and
the
same
person
the
description
given
me
of
the
first
by
no
means
tallied
with
what
i
knew
of
the
latter'
'in
this
i
easily
recognize
donna
rodolpha's
perfidious
character
every
word
of
this
account
is
stamped
with
marks
of
her
malice
of
her
falsehood
of
her
talents
for
misrepresenting
those
whom
she
wishes
to
injure
forgive
me
medina
for
speaking
so
freely
of
your
relation
the
mischief
which
she
has
done
me
authorises
my
resentment
and
when
you
have
heard
my
story
you
will
be
convinced
that
my
expressions
have
not
been
too
severe'
he
then
began
his
narrative
in
the
following
manner
history
of
don
raymond
marquis
de
las
cisternas
long
experience
my
dear
lorenzo
has
convinced
me
how
generous
is
your
nature
i
waited
not
for
your
declaration
of
ignorance
respecting
your
sister's
adventures
to
suppose
that
they
had
been
purposely
concealed
from
you
had
they
reached
your
knowledge
from
what
misfortunes
should
both
agnes
and
myself
have
escaped
fate
had
ordained
it
otherwise
you
were
on
your
travels
when
i
first
became
acquainted
with
your
sister
and
as
our
enemies
took
care
to
conceal
from
her
your
direction
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
implore
by
letter
your
protection
and
advice
on
leaving
salamanca
at
which
university
as
i
have
since
heard
you
remained
a
year
after
i
quitted
it
i
immediately
set
out
upon
my
travels
my
father
supplied
me
liberally
with
money
but
he
insisted
upon
my
concealing
my
rank
and
presenting
myself
as
no
more
than
a
private
gentleman
this
command
was
issued
by
the
counsels
of
his
friend
the
duke
of
villa
hermosa
a
nobleman
for
whose
abilities
and
knowledge
of
the
world
i
have
ever
entertained
the
most
profound
veneration
'believe
me'
said
he
'my
dear
raymond
you
will
hereafter
feel
the
benefits
of
this
temporary
degradation
'tis
true
that
as
the
conde
de
las
cisternas
you
would
have
been
received
with
open
arms
and
your
youthful
vanity
might
have
felt
gratified
by
the
attentions
showered
upon
you
from
all
sides
at
present
much
will
depend
upon
yourself
you
have
excellent
recommendations
but
it
must
be
your
own
business
to
make
them
of
use
to
you
you
must
lay
yourself
out
to
please
you
must
labour
to
gain
the
approbation
of
those
to
whom
you
are
presented
they
who
would
have
courted
the
friendship
of
the
conde
de
las
cisternas
will
have
no
interest
in
finding
out
the
merits
or
bearing
patiently
with
the
faults
of
alphonso
d'alvarada
consequently
when
you
find
yourself
really
liked
you
may
safely
ascribe
it
to
your
good
qualities
not
your
rank
and
the
distinction
shown
you
will
be
infinitely
more
flattering
besides
your
exalted
birth
would
not
permit
your
mixing
with
the
lower
classes
of
society
which
will
now
be
in
your
power
and
from
which
in
my
opinion
you
will
derive
considerable
benefit
do
not
confine
yourself
to
the
illustrious
of
those
countries
through
which
you
pass
examine
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
multitude
enter
into
the
cottages
and
by
observing
how
the
vassals
of
foreigners
are
treated
learn
to
diminish
the
burthens
and
augment
the
comforts
of
your
own
according
to
my
ideas
of
those
advantages
which
a
youth
destined
to
the
possession
of
power
and
wealth
may
reap
from
travel
he
should
not
consider
as
the
least
essential
the
opportunity
of
mixing
with
the
classes
below
him
and
becoming
an
eyewitness
of
the
sufferings
of
the
people'
forgive
me
lorenzo
if
i
seem
tedious
in
my
narration
the
close
connexion
which
now
exists
between
us
makes
me
anxious
that
you
should
know
every
particular
respecting
me
and
in
my
fear
of
omitting
the
least
circumstance
which
may
induce
you
to
think
favourably
of
your
sister
and
myself
i
may
possibly
relate
many
which
you
may
think
uninteresting
i
followed
the
duke's
advice
i
was
soon
convinced
of
its
wisdom
i
quitted
spain
calling
myself
by
the
assumed
title
of
don
alphonso
d'alvarada
and
attended
by
a
single
domestic
of
approved
fidelity
paris
was
my
first
station
for
some
time
i
was
enchanted
with
it
as
indeed
must
be
every
man
who
is
young
rich
and
fond
of
pleasure
yet
among
all
its
gaieties
i
felt
that
something
was
wanting
to
my
heart
i
grew
sick
of
dissipation
i
discovered
that
the
people
among
whom
i
lived
and
whose
exterior
was
so
polished
and
seducing
were
at
bottom
frivolous
unfeeling
and
insincere
i
turned
from
the
inhabitants
of
paris
with
disgust
and
quitted
that
theatre
of
luxury
without
heaving
one
sigh
of
regret
i
now
bent
my
course
towards
germany
intending
to
visit
most
of
the
principal
courts
prior
to
this
expedition
i
meant
to
make
some
little
stay
at
strasbourg
on
quitting
my
chaise
at
luneville
to
take
some
refreshment
i
observed
a
splendid
equipage
attended
by
four
domestics
in
rich
liveries
waiting
at
the
door
of
the
silver
lion
soon
after
as
i
looked
out
of
the
window
i
saw
a
lady
of
noble
presence
followed
by
two
female
attendants
step
into
the
carriage
which
drove
off
immediately
i
enquired
of
the
host
who
the
lady
was
that
had
just
departed
'a
german
baroness
monsieur
of
great
rank
and
fortune
she
has
been
upon
a
visit
to
the
duchess
of
longueville
as
her
servants
informed
me
she
is
going
to
strasbourg
where
she
will
find
her
husband
and
then
both
return
to
their
castle
in
germany'
i
resumed
my
journey
intending
to
reach
strasbourg
that
night
my
hopes
however
were
frustrated
by
the
breaking
down
of
my
chaise
the
accident
happened
in
the
middle
of
a
thick
forest
and
i
was
not
a
little
embarrassed
as
to
the
means
of
proceeding
it
was
the
depth
of
winter
the
night
was
already
closing
round
us
and
strasbourg
which
was
the
nearest
town
was
still
distant
from
us
several
leagues
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
only
alternative
to
passing
the
night
in
the
forest
was
to
take
my
servant's
horse
and
ride
on
to
strasbourg
an
undertaking
at
that
season
very
far
from
agreeable
however
seeing
no
other
resource
i
was
obliged
to
make
up
my
mind
to
it
accordingly
i
communicated
my
design
to
the
postillion
telling
him
that
i
would
send
people
to
assist
him
as
soon
as
i
reached
strasbourg
i
had
not
much
confidence
in
his
honesty
but
stephano
being
well-armed
and
the
driver
to
all
appearance
considerably
advanced
in
years
i
believed
i
ran
no
danger
of
losing
my
baggage
luckily
as
i
then
thought
an
opportunity
presented
itself
of
passing
the
night
more
agreeably
than
i
expected
on
mentioning
my
design
of
proceeding
by
myself
to
strasbourg
the
postillion
shook
his
head
in
disapprobation
'it
is
a
long
way'
said
he
'you
will
find
it
a
difficult
matter
to
arrive
there
without
a
guide
besides
monsieur
seems
unaccustomed
to
the
season's
severity
and
'tis
possible
that
unable
to
sustain
the
excessive
cold'
'what
use
is
there
to
present
me
with
all
these
objections'
said
i
impatiently
interrupting
him
'i
have
no
other
resource
i
run
still
greater
risque
of
perishing
with
cold
by
passing
the
night
in
the
forest'
'passing
the
night
in
the
forest'
he
replied
'oh
by
st
denis
we
are
not
in
quite
so
bad
a
plight
as
that
comes
to
yet
if
i
am
not
mistaken
we
are
scarcely
five
minutes
walk
from
the
cottage
of
my
old
friend
baptiste
he
is
a
wood-cutter
and
a
very
honest
fellow
i
doubt
not
but
he
will
shelter
you
for
the
night
with
pleasure
in
the
meantime
i
can
take
the
saddle-horse
ride
to
strasbourg
and
be
back
with
proper
people
to
mend
your
carriage
by
break
of
day'
'and
in
the
name
of
god'
said
i
'how
could
you
leave
me
so
long
in
suspense
why
did
you
not
tell
me
of
this
cottage
sooner
what
excessive
stupidity'
'i
thought
that
perhaps
monsieur
would
not
deign
to
accept'
'absurd
come
come
say
no
more
but
conduct
us
without
delay
to
the
wood-man's
cottage'
he
obeyed
and
we
moved
onwards
the
horses
contrived
with
some
difficulty
to
drag
the
shattered
vehicle
after
us
my
servant
was
become
almost
speechless
and
i
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
the
cold
myself
before
we
reached
the
wished-for
cottage
it
was
a
small
but
neat
building
as
we
drew
near
it
i
rejoiced
at
observing
through
the
window
the
blaze
of
a
comfortable
fire
our
conductor
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
some
time
before
any
one
answered
the
people
within
seemed
in
doubt
whether
we
should
be
admitted
'come
come
friend
baptiste'
cried
the
driver
with
impatience
'what
are
you
about
are
you
asleep
or
will
you
refuse
a
night's
lodging
to
a
gentleman
whose
chaise
has
just
broken
down
in
the
forest'
'ah
is
it
you
honest
claude'
replied
a
man's
voice
from
within
'wait
a
moment
and
the
door
shall
be
opened'
soon
after
the
bolts
were
drawn
back
the
door
was
unclosed
and
a
man
presented
himself
to
us
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
he
gave
the
guide
an
hearty
reception
and
then
addressed
himself
to
me
'walk
in
monsieur
walk
in
and
welcome
excuse
me
for
not
admitting
you
at
first
but
there
are
so
many
rogues
about
this
place
that
saving
your
presence
i
suspected
you
to
be
one'
thus
saying
he
ushered
me
into
the
room
where
i
had
observed
the
fire
i
was
immediately
placed
in
an
easy
chair
which
stood
close
to
the
hearth
a
female
whom
i
supposed
to
be
the
wife
of
my
host
rose
from
her
seat
upon
my
entrance
and
received
me
with
a
slight
and
distant
reverence
she
made
no
answer
to
my
compliment
but
immediately
re-seating
herself
continued
the
work
on
which
she
had
been
employed
her
husband's
manners
were
as
friendly
as
hers
were
harsh
and
repulsive
'i
wish
i
could
lodge
you
more
conveniently
monsieur'
said
he
'but
we
cannot
boast
of
much
spare
room
in
this
hovel
however
a
chamber
for
yourself
and
another
for
your
servant
i
think
we
can
make
shift
to
supply
you
must
content
yourself
with
sorry
fare
but
to
what
we
have
believe
me
you
are
heartily
welcome'
----then
turning
to
his
wife--'why
how
you
sit
there
marguerite
with
as
much
tranquillity
as
if
you
had
nothing
better
to
do
stir
about
dame
stir
about
get
some
supper
look
out
some
sheets
here
here
throw
some
logs
upon
the
fire
for
the
gentleman
seems
perished
with
cold'
the
wife
threw
her
work
hastily
upon
the
table
and
proceeded
to
execute
his
commands
with
every
mark
of
unwillingness
her
countenance
had
displeased
me
on
the
first
moment
of
my
examining
it
yet
upon
the
whole
her
features
were
handsome
unquestionably
but
her
skin
was
sallow
and
her
person
thin
and
meagre
a
louring
gloom
over-spread
her
countenance
and
it
bore
such
visible
marks
of
rancour
and
ill-will
as
could
not
escape
being
noticed
by
the
most
inattentive
observer
her
every
look
and
action
expressed
discontent
and
impatience
and
the
answers
which
she
gave
baptiste
when
he
reproached
her
good-humouredly
for
her
dissatisfied
air
were
tart
short
and
cutting
in
tine
i
conceived
at
first
sight
equal
disgust
for
her
and
prepossession
in
favour
of
her
husband
whose
appearance
was
calculated
to
inspire
esteem
and
confidence
his
countenance
was
open
sincere
and
friendly
his
manners
had
all
the
peasant's
honesty
unaccompanied
by
his
rudeness
his
cheeks
were
broad
full
and
ruddy
and
in
the
solidity
of
his
person
he
seemed
to
offer
an
ample
apology
for
the
leanness
of
his
wife's
from
the
wrinkles
on
his
brow
i
judged
him
to
be
turned
of
sixty
but
he
bore
his
years
well
and
seemed
still
hearty
and
strong
the
wife
could
not
be
more
than
thirty
but
in
spirits
and
vivacity
she
was
infinitely
older
than
the
husband
however
in
spite
of
her
unwillingness
marguerite
began
to
prepare
the
supper
while
the
wood-man
conversed
gaily
on
different
subjects
the
postillion
who
had
been
furnished
with
a
bottle
of
spirits
was
now
ready
to
set
out
for
strasbourg
and
enquired
whether
i
had
any
further
commands
'for
strasbourg'
interrupted
baptiste
'you
are
not
going
thither
tonight'
'i
beg
your
pardon
if
i
do
not
fetch
workmen
to
mend
the
chaise
how
is
monsieur
to
proceed
tomorrow'
'that
is
true
as
you
say
i
had
forgotten
the
chaise
well
but
claude
you
may
at
least
eat
your
supper
here
that
can
make
you
lose
very
little
time
and
monsieur
looks
too
kind-hearted
to
send
you
out
with
an
empty
stomach
on
such
a
bitter
cold
night
as
this
is'
to
this
i
readily
assented
telling
the
postillion
that
my
reaching
strasbourg
the
next
day
an
hour
or
two
later
would
be
perfectly
immaterial
he
thanked
me
and
then
leaving
the
cottage
with
stephano
put
up
his
horses
in
the
wood-man's
stable
baptiste
followed
them
to
the
door
and
looked
out
with
anxiety
''tis
a
sharp
biting
wind'
said
he
'i
wonder
what
detains
my
boys
so
long
monsieur
i
shall
show
you
two
of
the
finest
lads
that
ever
stept
in
shoe
of
leather
the
eldest
is
three
and
twenty
the
second
a
year
younger
their
equals
for
sense
courage
and
activity
are
not
to
be
found
within
fifty
miles
of
strasbourg
would
they
were
back
again
i
begin
to
feel
uneasy
about
them'
marguerite
was
at
this
time
employed
in
laying
the
cloth
'and
are
you
equally
anxious
for
the
return
of
your
sons'
said
i
to
her
'not
i'
she
replied
peevishly
'they
are
no
children
of
mine'
'come
come
marguerite'
said
the
husband
'do
not
be
out
of
humour
with
the
gentleman
for
asking
a
simple
question
had
you
not
looked
so
cross
he
would
never
have
thought
you
old
enough
to
have
a
son
of
three
and
twenty
but
you
see
how
many
years
ill-temper
adds
to
you--excuse
my
wife's
rudeness
monsieur
a
little
thing
puts
her
out
and
she
is
somewhat
displeased
at
your
not
thinking
her
to
be
under
thirty
that
is
the
truth
is
it
not
marguerite
you
know
monsieur
that
age
is
always
a
ticklish
subject
with
a
woman
come
come
marguerite
clear
up
a
little
if
you
have
not
sons
as
old
you
will
some
twenty
years
hence
and
i
hope
that
we
shall
live
to
see
them
just
such
lads
as
jacques
and
robert'
marguerite
clasped
her
hands
together
passionately
'god
forbid'
said
she
'god
forbid
if
i
thought
it
i
would
strangle
them
with
my
own
hands'
she
quitted
the
room
hastily
and
went
up
stairs
i
could
not
help
expressing
to
the
wood-man
how
much
i
pitied
him
for
being
chained
for
life
to
a
partner
of
such
ill-humour
'ah
lord
monsieur
every
one
has
his
share
of
grievances
and
marguerite
has
fallen
to
mine
besides
after
all
she
is
only
cross
and
not
malicious
the
worst
is
that
her
affection
for
two
children
by
a
former
husband
makes
her
play
the
step-mother
with
my
two
sons
she
cannot
bear
the
sight
of
them
and
by
her
good-will
they
would
never
set
a
foot
within
my
door
but
on
this
point
i
always
stand
firm
and
never
will
consent
to
abandon
the
poor
lads
to
the
world's
mercy
as
she
has
often
solicited
me
to
do
in
every
thing
else
i
let
her
have
her
own
way
and
truly
she
manages
a
family
rarely
that
i
must
say
for
her'
we
were
conversing
in
this
manner
when
our
discourse
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
halloo
which
rang
through
the
forest
'my
sons
i
hope'
exclaimed
the
wood-man
and
ran
to
open
the
door
the
halloo
was
repeated
we
now
distinguished
the
trampling
of
horses
and
soon
after
a
carriage
attended
by
several
cavaliers
stopped
at
the
cottage
door
one
of
the
horsemen
enquired
how
far
they
were
still
from
strasbourg
as
he
addressed
himself
to
me
i
answered
in
the
number
of
miles
which
claude
had
told
me
upon
which
a
volley
of
curses
was
vented
against
the
drivers
for
having
lost
their
way
the
persons
in
the
coach
were
now
informed
of
the
distance
of
strasbourg
and
also
that
the
horses
were
so
fatigued
as
to
be
incapable
of
proceeding
further
a
lady
who
appeared
to
be
the
principal
expressed
much
chagrin
at
this
intelligence
but
as
there
was
no
remedy
one
of
the
attendants
asked
the
wood-man
whether
he
could
furnish
them
with
lodging
for
the
night
he
seemed
much
embarrassed
and
replied
in
the
negative
adding
that
a
spanish
gentleman
and
his
servant
were
already
in
possession
of
the
only
spare
apartments
in
his
house
on
hearing
this
the
gallantry
of
my
nation
would
not
permit
me
to
retain
those
accommodations
of
which
a
female
was
in
want
i
instantly
signified
to
the
wood-man
that
i
transferred
my
right
to
the
lady
he
made
some
objections
but
i
overruled
them
and
hastening
to
the
carriage
opened
the
door
and
assisted
the
lady
to
descend
i
immediately
recognized
her
for
the
same
person
whom
i
had
seen
at
the
inn
at
luneville
i
took
an
opportunity
of
asking
one
of
her
attendants
what
was
her
name
'the
baroness
lindenberg'
was
the
answer
i
could
not
but
remark
how
different
a
reception
our
host
had
given
these
newcomers
and
myself
his
reluctance
to
admit
them
was
visibly
expressed
on
his
countenance
and
he
prevailed
on
himself
with
difficulty
to
tell
the
lady
that
she
was
welcome
i
conducted
her
into
the
house
and
placed
her
in
the
armed-chair
which
i
had
just
quitted
she
thanked
me
very
graciously
and
made
a
thousand
apologies
for
putting
me
to
an
inconvenience
suddenly
the
wood-man's
countenance
cleared
up
'at
last
i
have
arranged
it'
said
he
interrupting
her
excuses
'i
can
lodge
you
and
your
suite
madam
and
you
will
not
be
under
the
necessity
of
making
this
gentleman
suffer
for
his
politeness
we
have
two
spare
chambers
one
for
the
lady
the
other
monsieur
for
you
my
wife
shall
give
up
hers
to
the
two
waiting-women
as
for
the
men-servants
they
must
content
themselves
with
passing
the
night
in
a
large
barn
which
stands
at
a
few
yards
distance
from
the
house
there
they
shall
have
a
blazing
fire
and
as
good
a
supper
as
we
can
make
shift
to
give
them'
after
several
expressions
of
gratitude
on
the
lady's
part
and
opposition
on
mine
to
marguerite's
giving
up
her
bed
this
arrangement
was
agreed
to
as
the
room
was
small
the
baroness
immediately
dismissed
her
male
domestics
baptiste
was
on
the
point
of
conducting
them
to
the
barn
which
he
had
mentioned
when
two
young
men
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
'hell
and
furies'
exclaimed
the
first
starting
back
'robert
the
house
is
filled
with
strangers'
'ha
there
are
my
sons'
cried
our
host
'why
jacques
robert
whither
are
you
running
boys
there
is
room
enough
still
for
you'
upon
this
assurance
the
youths
returned
the
father
presented
them
to
the
baroness
and
myself
after
which
he
withdrew
with
our
domestics
while
at
the
request
of
the
two
waiting-women
marguerite
conducted
them
to
the
room
designed
for
their
mistress
the
two
new-comers
were
tall
stout
well-made
young
men
hard-featured
and
very
much
sun-burnt
they
paid
their
compliments
to
us
in
few
words
and
acknowledged
claude
who
now
entered
the
room
as
an
old
acquaintance
they
then
threw
aside
their
cloaks
in
which
they
were
wrapped
up
took
off
a
leathern
belt
to
which
a
large
cutlass
was
suspended
and
each
drawing
a
brace
of
pistols
from
his
girdle
laid
them
upon
a
shelf
'you
travel
well-armed'
said
i
'true
monsieur'
replied
robert
'we
left
strasbourg
late
this
evening
and
'tis
necessary
to
take
precautions
at
passing
through
this
forest
after
dark
it
does
not
bear
a
good
repute
i
promise
you'
'how'
said
the
baroness
'are
there
robbers
hereabout'
'so
it
is
said
madame
for
my
own
part
i
have
travelled
through
the
wood
at
all
hours
and
never
met
with
one
of
them'
here
marguerite
returned
her
stepsons
drew
her
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
whispered
her
for
some
minutes
by
the
looks
which
they
cast
towards
us
at
intervals
i
conjectured
them
to
be
enquiring
our
business
in
the
cottage
in
the
meanwhile
the
baroness
expressed
her
apprehensions
that
her
husband
would
be
suffering
much
anxiety
upon
her
account
she
had
intended
to
send
on
one
of
her
servants
to
inform
the
baron
of
her
delay
but
the
account
which
the
young
men
gave
of
the
forest
rendered
this
plan
impracticable
claude
relieved
her
from
her
embarrassment
he
informed
her
that
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
reaching
strasbourg
that
night
and
that
would
she
trust
him
with
a
letter
she
might
depend
upon
its
being
safely
delivered
'and
how
comes
it'
said
i
'that
you
are
under
no
apprehension
of
meeting
these
robbers'
'alas
monsieur
a
poor
man
with
a
large
family
must
not
lose
certain
profit
because
'tis
attended
with
a
little
danger
and
perhaps
my
lord
the
baron
may
give
me
a
trifle
for
my
pains
besides
i
have
nothing
to
lose
except
my
life
and
that
will
not
be
worth
the
robbers
taking'
i
thought
his
arguments
bad
and
advised
his
waiting
till
the
morning
but
as
the
baroness
did
not
second
me
i
was
obliged
to
give
up
the
point
the
baroness
lindenberg
as
i
found
afterwards
had
long
been
accustomed
to
sacrifice
the
interests
of
others
to
her
own
and
her
wish
to
send
claude
to
strasbourg
blinded
her
to
the
danger
of
the
undertaking
accordingly
it
was
resolved
that
he
should
set
out
without
delay
the
baroness
wrote
her
letter
to
her
husband
and
i
sent
a
few
lines
to
my
banker
apprising
him
that
i
should
not
be
at
strasbourg
till
the
next
day
claude
took
our
letters
and
left
the
cottage
the
lady
declared
herself
much
fatigued
by
her
journey
besides
having
come
from
some
distance
the
drivers
had
contrived
to
lose
their
way
in
the
forest
she
now
addressed
herself
to
marguerite
desiring
to
be
shown
to
her
chamber
and
permitted
to
take
half
an
hour's
repose
one
of
the
waiting-women
was
immediately
summoned
she
appeared
with
a
light
and
the
baroness
followed
her
up
stairs
the
cloth
was
spreading
in
the
chamber
where
i
was
and
marguerite
soon
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
was
in
her
way
her
hints
were
too
broad
to
be
easily
mistaken
i
therefore
desired
one
of
the
young
men
to
conduct
me
to
the
chamber
where
i
was
to
sleep
and
where
i
could
remain
till
supper
was
ready
'which
chamber
is
it
mother'
said
robert
'the
one
with
green
hangings'
she
replied
'i
have
just
been
at
the
trouble
of
getting
it
ready
and
have
put
fresh
sheets
upon
the
bed
if
the
gentleman
chooses
to
lollop
and
lounge
upon
it
he
may
make
it
again
himself
for
me'
'you
are
out
of
humour
mother
but
that
is
no
novelty
have
the
goodness
to
follow
me
monsieur'
he
opened
the
door
and
advanced
towards
a
narrow
staircase
'you
have
got
no
light'
said
marguerite
'is
it
your
own
neck
or
the
gentleman's
that
you
have
a
mind
to
break'
she
crossed
by
me
and
put
a
candle
into
robert's
hand
having
received
which
he
began
to
ascend
the
staircase
jacques
was
employed
in
laying
the
cloth
and
his
back
was
turned
towards
me
marguerite
seized
the
moment
when
we
were
unobserved
she
caught
my
hand
and
pressed
it
strongly
'look
at
the
sheets'
said
she
as
she
passed
me
and
immediately
resumed
her
former
occupation
startled
by
the
abruptness
of
her
action
i
remained
as
if
petrified
robert's
voice
desiring
me
to
follow
him
recalled
me
to
myself
i
ascended
the
staircase
my
conductor
ushered
me
into
a
chamber
where
an
excellent
wood-fire
was
blazing
upon
the
hearth
he
placed
the
light
upon
the
table
enquired
whether
i
had
any
further
commands
and
on
my
replying
in
the
negative
he
left
me
to
myself
you
may
be
certain
that
the
moment
when
i
found
myself
alone
was
that
on
which
i
complied
with
marguerite's
injunction
i
took
the
candle
hastily
approached
the
bed
and
turned
down
the
coverture
what
was
my
astonishment
my
horror
at
finding
the
sheets
crimsoned
with
blood
at
that
moment
a
thousand
confused
ideas
passed
before
my
imagination
the
robbers
who
infested
the
wood
marguerite's
exclamation
respecting
her
children
the
arms
and
appearance
of
the
two
young
men
and
the
various
anecdotes
which
i
had
heard
related
respecting
the
secret
correspondence
which
frequently
exists
between
banditti
and
postillions
all
these
circumstances
flashed
upon
my
mind
and
inspired
me
with
doubt
and
apprehension
i
ruminated
on
the
most
probable
means
of
ascertaining
the
truth
of
my
conjectures
suddenly
i
was
aware
of
someone
below
pacing
hastily
backwards
and
forwards
every
thing
now
appeared
to
me
an
object
of
suspicion
with
precaution
i
drew
near
the
window
which
as
the
room
had
been
long
shut
up
was
left
open
in
spite
of
the
cold
i
ventured
to
look
out
the
beams
of
the
moon
permitted
me
to
distinguish
a
man
whom
i
had
no
difficulty
to
recognize
for
my
host
i
watched
his
movements
he
walked
swiftly
then
stopped
and
seemed
to
listen
he
stamped
upon
the
ground
and
beat
his
stomach
with
his
arms
as
if
to
guard
himself
from
the
inclemency
of
the
season
at
the
least
noise
if
a
voice
was
heard
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
if
a
bat
flitted
past
him
or
the
wind
rattled
amidst
the
leafless
boughs
he
started
and
looked
round
with
anxiety
'plague
take
him'
said
he
at
length
with
impatience
'what
can
he
be
about'
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
but
as
he
was
just
below
my
window
i
had
no
difficulty
to
distinguish
his
words
i
now
heard
the
steps
of
one
approaching
baptiste
went
towards
the
sound
he
joined
a
man
whom
his
low
stature
and
the
horn
suspended
from
his
neck
declared
to
be
no
other
than
my
faithful
claude
whom
i
had
supposed
to
be
already
on
his
way
to
strasbourg
expecting
their
discourse
to
throw
some
light
upon
my
situation
i
hastened
to
put
myself
in
a
condition
to
hear
it
with
safety
for
this
purpose
i
extinguished
the
candle
which
stood
upon
a
table
near
the
bed
the
flame
of
the
fire
was
not
strong
enough
to
betray
me
and
i
immediately
resumed
my
place
at
the
window
the
objects
of
my
curiosity
had
stationed
themselves
directly
under
it
i
suppose
that
during
my
momentary
absence
the
wood-man
had
been
blaming
claude
for
tardiness
since
when
i
returned
to
the
window
the
latter
was
endeavouring
to
excuse
his
fault
'however'
added
he
'my
diligence
at
present
shall
make
up
for
my
past
delay'
'on
that
condition'
answered
baptiste
'i
shall
readily
forgive
you
but
in
truth
as
you
share
equally
with
us
in
our
prizes
your
own
interest
will
make
you
use
all
possible
diligence
'twould
be
a
shame
to
let
such
a
noble
booty
escape
us
you
say
that
this
spaniard
is
rich'
'his
servant
boasted
at
the
inn
that
the
effects
in
his
chaise
were
worth
above
two
thousand
pistoles'
oh
how
i
cursed
stephano's
imprudent
vanity
'and
i
have
been
told'
continued
the
postillion
'that
this
baroness
carries
about
her
a
casket
of
jewels
of
immense
value'
'may
be
so
but
i
had
rather
she
had
stayed
away
the
spaniard
was
a
secure
prey
the
boys
and
myself
could
easily
have
mastered
him
and
his
servant
and
then
the
two
thousand
pistoles
would
have
been
shared
between
us
four
now
we
must
let
in
the
band
for
a
share
and
perhaps
the
whole
covey
may
escape
us
should
our
friends
have
betaken
themselves
to
their
different
posts
before
you
reach
the
cavern
all
will
be
lost
the
lady's
attendants
are
too
numerous
for
us
to
overpower
them
unless
our
associates
arrive
in
time
we
must
needs
let
these
travellers
set
out
tomorrow
without
damage
or
hurt'
''tis
plaguy
unlucky
that
my
comrades
who
drove
the
coach
should
be
those
unacquainted
with
our
confederacy
but
never
fear
friend
baptiste
an
hour
will
bring
me
to
the
cavern
it
is
now
but
ten
o'clock
and
by
twelve
you
may
expect
the
arrival
of
the
band
by
the
bye
take
care
of
your
wife
you
know
how
strong
is
her
repugnance
to
our
mode
of
life
and
she
may
find
means
to
give
information
to
the
lady's
servants
of
our
design'
'oh
i
am
secure
of
her
silence
she
is
too
much
afraid
of
me
and
fond
of
her
children
to
dare
to
betray
my
secret
besides
jacques
and
robert
keep
a
strict
eye
over
her
and
she
is
not
permitted
to
set
a
foot
out
of
the
cottage
the
servants
are
safely
lodged
in
the
barn
i
shall
endeavour
to
keep
all
quiet
till
the
arrival
of
our
friends
were
i
assured
of
your
finding
them
the
strangers
should
be
dispatched
this
instant
but
as
it
is
possible
for
you
to
miss
the
banditti
i
am
fearful
of
being
summoned
to
produce
them
by
their
domestics
in
the
morning'
'and
suppose
either
of
the
travellers
should
discover
your
design'
'then
we
must
poignard
those
in
our
power
and
take
our
chance
about
mastering
the
rest
however
to
avoid
running
such
a
risque
hasten
to
the
cavern
the
banditti
never
leave
it
before
eleven
and
if
you
use
diligence
you
may
reach
it
in
time
to
stop
them'
'tell
robert
that
i
have
taken
his
horse
my
own
has
broken
his
bridle
and
escaped
into
the
wood
what
is
the
watch-word'
'the
reward
of
courage'
''tis
sufficient
i
hasten
to
the
cavern'
'and
i
to
rejoin
my
guests
lest
my
absence
should
create
suspicion
farewell
and
be
diligent'
these
worthy
associates
now
separated
the
one
bent
his
course
towards
the
stable
while
the
other
returned
to
the
house
you
may
judge
what
must
have
been
my
feelings
during
this
conversation
of
which
i
lost
not
a
single
syllable
i
dared
not
trust
myself
to
my
reflections
nor
did
any
means
present
itself
to
escape
the
dangers
which
threatened
me
resistance
i
knew
to
be
vain
i
was
unarmed
and
a
single
man
against
three
however
i
resolved
at
least
to
sell
my
life
as
dearly
as
i
could
dreading
lest
baptiste
should
perceive
my
absence
and
suspect
me
to
have
overheard
the
message
with
which
claude
was
dispatched
i
hastily
relighted
my
candle
and
quitted
the
chamber
on
descending
i
found
the
table
spread
for
six
persons
the
baroness
sat
by
the
fireside
marguerite
was
employed
in
dressing
a
sallad
and
her
step-sons
were
whispering
together
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
baptiste
having
the
round
of
the
garden
to
make
ere
he
could
reach
the
cottage
door
was
not
yet
arrived
i
seated
myself
quietly
opposite
to
the
baroness
a
glance
upon
marguerite
told
her
that
her
hint
had
not
been
thrown
away
upon
me
how
different
did
she
now
appear
to
me
what
before
seemed
gloom
and
sullenness
i
now
found
to
be
disgust
at
her
associates
and
compassion
for
my
danger
i
looked
up
to
her
as
to
my
only
resource
yet
knowing
her
to
be
watched
by
her
husband
with
a
suspicious
eye
i
could
place
but
little
reliance
on
the
exertions
of
her
good-will
in
spite
of
all
my
endeavours
to
conceal
it
my
agitation
was
but
too
visibly
expressed
upon
my
countenance
i
was
pale
and
both
my
words
and
actions
were
disordered
and
embarrassed
the
young
men
observed
this
and
enquired
the
cause
i
attributed
it
to
excess
of
fatigue
and
the
violent
effect
produced
on
me
by
the
severity
of
the
season
whether
they
believed
me
or
not
i
will
not
pretend
to
say
they
at
least
ceased
to
embarrass
me
with
their
questions
i
strove
to
divert
my
attention
from
the
perils
which
surrounded
me
by
conversing
on
different
subjects
with
the
baroness
i
talked
of
germany
declaring
my
intention
of
visiting
it
immediately
god
knows
that
i
little
thought
at
that
moment
of
ever
seeing
it
she
replied
to
me
with
great
ease
and
politeness
professed
that
the
pleasure
of
making
my
acquaintance
amply
compensated
for
the
delay
in
her
journey
and
gave
me
a
pressing
invitation
to
make
some
stay
at
the
castle
of
lindenberg
as
she
spoke
thus
the
youths
exchanged
a
malicious
smile
which
declared
that
she
would
be
fortunate
if
she
ever
reached
that
castle
herself
this
action
did
not
escape
me
but
i
concealed
the
emotion
which
it
excited
in
my
breast
i
continued
to
converse
with
the
lady
but
my
discourse
was
so
frequently
incoherent
that
as
she
has
since
informed
me
she
began
to
doubt
whether
i
was
in
my
right
senses
the
fact
was
that
while
my
conversation
turned
upon
one
subject
my
thoughts
were
entirely
occupied
by
another
i
meditated
upon
the
means
of
quitting
the
cottage
finding
my
way
to
the
barn
and
giving
the
domestics
information
of
our
host's
designs
i
was
soon
convinced
how
impracticable
was
the
attempt
jacques
and
robert
watched
my
every
movement
with
an
attentive
eye
and
i
was
obliged
to
abandon
the
idea
all
my
hopes
now
rested
upon
claude's
not
finding
the
banditti
in
that
case
according
to
what
i
had
overheard
we
should
be
permitted
to
depart
unhurt
i
shuddered
involuntarily
as
baptiste
entered
the
room
he
made
many
apologies
for
his
long
absence
but
'he
had
been
detained
by
affairs
impossible
to
be
delayed'
he
then
entreated
permission
for
his
family
to
sup
at
the
same
table
with
us
without
which
respect
would
not
authorize
his
taking
such
a
liberty
oh
how
in
my
heart
i
cursed
the
hypocrite
how
i
loathed
his
presence
who
was
on
the
point
of
depriving
me
of
an
existence
at
that
time
infinitely
dear
i
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
life
i
had
youth
wealth
rank
and
education
and
the
fairest
prospects
presented
themselves
before
me
i
saw
those
prospects
on
the
point
of
closing
in
the
most
horrible
manner
yet
was
i
obliged
to
dissimulate
and
to
receive
with
a
semblance
of
gratitude
the
false
civilities
of
him
who
held
the
dagger
to
my
bosom
the
permission
which
our
host
demanded
was
easily
obtained
we
seated
ourselves
at
the
table
the
baroness
and
myself
occupied
one
side
the
sons
were
opposite
to
us
with
their
backs
to
the
door
baptiste
took
his
seat
by
the
baroness
at
the
upper
end
and
the
place
next
to
him
was
left
for
his
wife
she
soon
entered
the
room
and
placed
before
us
a
plain
but
comfortable
peasant's
repast
our
host
thought
it
necessary
to
apologize
for
the
poorness
of
the
supper
'he
had
not
been
apprized
of
our
coming
he
could
only
offer
us
such
fare
as
had
been
intended
for
his
own
family'
'but'
added
he
'should
any
accident
detain
my
noble
guests
longer
than
they
at
present
intend
i
hope
to
give
them
a
better
treatment'
the
villain
i
well
knew
the
accident
to
which
he
alluded
i
shuddered
at
the
treatment
which
he
taught
us
to
expect
my
companion
in
danger
seemed
entirely
to
have
got
rid
of
her
chagrin
at
being
delayed
she
laughed
and
conversed
with
the
family
with
infinite
gaiety
i
strove
but
in
vain
to
follow
her
example
my
spirits
were
evidently
forced
and
the
constraint
which
i
put
upon
myself
escaped
not
baptiste's
observation
'come
come
monsieur
cheer
up'
said
he
'you
seem
not
quite
recovered
from
your
fatigue
to
raise
your
spirits
what
say
you
to
a
glass
of
excellent
old
wine
which
was
left
me
by
my
father
god
rest
his
soul
he
is
in
a
better
world
i
seldom
produce
this
wine
but
as
i
am
not
honoured
with
such
guests
every
day
this
is
an
occasion
which
deserves
a
bottle'
he
then
gave
his
wife
a
key
and
instructed
her
where
to
find
the
wine
of
which
he
spoke
she
seemed
by
no
means
pleased
with
the
commission
she
took
the
key
with
an
embarrassed
air
and
hesitated
to
quit
the
table
'did
you
hear
me'
said
baptiste
in
an
angry
tone
marguerite
darted
upon
him
a
look
of
mingled
anger
and
fear
and
left
the
chamber
his
eyes
followed
her
suspiciously
till
she
had
closed
the
door
she
soon
returned
with
a
bottle
sealed
with
yellow
wax
she
placed
it
upon
the
table
and
gave
the
key
back
to
her
husband
i
suspected
that
this
liquor
was
not
presented
to
us
without
design
and
i
watched
marguerite's
movements
with
inquietude
she
was
employed
in
rinsing
some
small
horn
goblets
as
she
placed
them
before
baptiste
she
saw
that
my
eye
was
fixed
upon
her
and
at
the
moment
when
she
thought
herself
unobserved
by
the
banditti
she
motioned
to
me
with
her
head
not
to
taste
the
liquor
she
then
resumed
her
place
in
the
mean
while
our
host
had
drawn
the
cork
and
filling
two
of
the
goblets
offered
them
to
the
lady
and
myself
she
at
first
made
some
objections
but
the
instances
of
baptiste
were
so
urgent
that
she
was
obliged
to
comply
fearing
to
excite
suspicion
i
hesitated
not
to
take
the
goblet
presented
to
me
by
its
smell
and
colour
i
guessed
it
to
be
champagne
but
some
grains
of
powder
floating
upon
the
top
convinced
me
that
it
was
not
unadulterated
however
i
dared
not
to
express
my
repugnance
to
drinking
it
i
lifted
it
to
my
lips
and
seemed
to
be
swallowing
it
suddenly
starting
from
my
chair
i
made
the
best
of
my
way
towards
a
vase
of
water
at
some
distance
in
which
marguerite
had
been
rinsing
the
goblets
i
pretended
to
spit
out
the
wine
with
disgust
and
took
an
opportunity
unperceived
of
emptying
the
liquor
into
the
vase
the
banditti
seemed
alarmed
at
my
action
jacques
half
rose
from
his
chair
put
his
hand
into
his
bosom
and
i
discovered
the
haft
of
a
dagger
i
returned
to
my
seat
with
tranquillity
and
affected
not
to
have
observed
their
confusion
'you
have
not
suited
my
taste
honest
friend'
said
i
addressing
myself
to
baptiste
'i
never
can
drink
champagne
without
its
producing
a
violent
illness
i
swallowed
a
few
mouthfuls
ere
i
was
aware
of
its
quality
and
fear
that
i
shall
suffer
for
my
imprudence'
baptiste
and
jacques
exchanged
looks
of
distrust
'perhaps'
said
robert
'the
smell
may
be
disagreeable
to
you'
he
quitted
his
chair
and
removed
the
goblet
i
observed
that
he
examined
whether
it
was
nearly
empty
'he
must
have
drank
sufficient'
said
he
to
his
brother
in
a
low
voice
while
he
reseated
himself
marguerite
looked
apprehensive
that
i
had
tasted
the
liquor
a
glance
from
my
eye
reassured
her
i
waited
with
anxiety
for
the
effects
which
the
beverage
would
produce
upon
the
lady
i
doubted
not
but
the
grains
which
i
had
observed
were
poisonous
and
lamented
that
it
had
been
impossible
for
me
to
warn
her
of
the
danger
but
a
few
minutes
had
elapsed
before
i
perceived
her
eyes
grow
heavy
her
head
sank
upon
her
shoulder
and
she
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
i
affected
not
to
attend
to
this
circumstance
and
continued
my
conversation
with
baptiste
with
all
the
outward
gaiety
in
my
power
to
assume
but
he
no
longer
answered
me
without
constraint
he
eyed
me
with
distrust
and
astonishment
and
i
saw
that
the
banditti
were
frequently
whispering
among
themselves
my
situation
became
every
moment
more
painful
i
sustained
the
character
of
confidence
with
a
worse
grace
than
ever
equally
afraid
of
the
arrival
of
their
accomplices
and
of
their
suspecting
my
knowledge
of
their
designs
i
knew
not
how
to
dissipate
the
distrust
which
the
banditti
evidently
entertained
for
me
in
this
new
dilemma
the
friendly
marguerite
again
assisted
me
she
passed
behind
the
chairs
of
her
stepsons
stopped
for
a
moment
opposite
to
me
closed
her
eyes
and
reclined
her
head
upon
her
shoulder
this
hint
immediately
dispelled
my
incertitude
it
told
me
that
i
ought
to
imitate
the
baroness
and
pretend
that
the
liquor
had
taken
its
full
effect
upon
me
i
did
so
and
in
a
few
minutes
seemed
perfectly
overcome
with
slumber
'so'
cried
baptiste
as
i
fell
back
in
my
chair
'at
last
he
sleeps
i
began
to
think
that
he
had
scented
our
design
and
that
we
should
have
been
forced
to
dispatch
him
at
all
events'
'and
why
not
dispatch
him
at
all
events'
enquired
the
ferocious
jacques
'why
leave
him
the
possibility
of
betraying
our
secret
marguerite
give
me
one
of
my
pistols
a
single
touch
of
the
trigger
will
finish
him
at
once'
'and
supposing'
rejoined
the
father
'supposing
that
our
friends
should
not
arrive
tonight
a
pretty
figure
we
should
make
when
the
servants
enquire
for
him
in
the
morning
no
no
jacques
we
must
wait
for
our
associates
if
they
join
us
we
are
strong
enough
to
dispatch
the
domestics
as
well
as
their
masters
and
the
booty
is
our
own
if
claude
does
not
find
the
troop
we
must
take
patience
and
suffer
the
prey
to
slip
through
our
fingers
ah
boys
boys
had
you
arrived
but
five
minutes
sooner
the
spaniard
would
have
been
done
for
and
two
thousand
pistoles
our
own
but
you
are
always
out
of
the
way
when
you
are
most
wanted
you
are
the
most
unlucky
rogues'
'well
well
father'
answered
jacques
'had
you
been
of
my
mind
all
would
have
been
over
by
this
time
you
robert
claude
and
myself
why
the
strangers
were
but
double
the
number
and
i
warrant
you
we
might
have
mastered
them
however
claude
is
gone
'tis
too
late
to
think
of
it
now
we
must
wait
patiently
for
the
arrival
of
the
gang
and
if
the
travellers
escape
us
tonight
we
must
take
care
to
waylay
them
tomorrow'
'true
true'
said
baptiste
'marguerite
have
you
given
the
sleeping-draught
to
the
waiting-women'
she
replied
in
the
affirmative
'all
then
is
safe
come
come
boys
whatever
falls
out
we
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
this
adventure
we
run
no
danger
may
gain
much
and
can
lose
nothing'
at
this
moment
i
heard
a
trampling
of
horses
oh
how
dreadful
was
the
sound
to
my
ears
a
cold
sweat
flowed
down
my
forehead
and
i
felt
all
the
terrors
of
impending
death
i
was
by
no
means
reassured
by
hearing
the
compassionate
marguerite
exclaim
in
the
accents
of
despair
'almighty
god
they
are
lost'
luckily
the
wood-man
and
his
sons
were
too
much
occupied
by
the
arrival
of
their
associates
to
attend
to
me
or
the
violence
of
my
agitation
would
have
convinced
them
that
my
sleep
was
feigned
'open
open'
exclaimed
several
voices
on
the
outside
of
the
cottage
'yes
yes'
cried
baptiste
joyfully
'they
are
our
friends
sure
enough
now
then
our
booty
is
certain
away
lads
away
lead
them
to
the
barn
you
know
what
is
to
be
done
there'
robert
hastened
to
open
the
door
of
the
cottage
'but
first'
said
jacques
taking
up
his
arms
'first
let
me
dispatch
these
sleepers'
'no
no
no'
replied
his
father
'go
you
to
the
barn
where
your
presence
is
wanted
leave
me
to
take
care
of
these
and
the
women
above'
jacques
obeyed
and
followed
his
brother
they
seemed
to
converse
with
the
new-comers
for
a
few
minutes
after
which
i
heard
the
robbers
dismount
and
as
i
conjectured
bend
their
course
towards
the
barn
'so
that
is
wisely
done'
muttered
baptiste
'they
have
quitted
their
horses
that
they
may
fall
upon
the
strangers
by
surprise
good
good
and
now
to
business'
i
heard
him
approach
a
small
cupboard
which
was
fixed
up
in
a
distant
part
of
the
room
and
unlock
it
at
this
moment
i
felt
myself
shaken
gently
'now
now'
whispered
marguerite
i
opened
my
eyes
baptiste
stood
with
his
back
towards
me
no
one
else
was
in
the
room
save
marguerite
and
the
sleeping
lady
the
villain
had
taken
a
dagger
from
the
cupboard
and
seemed
examining
whether
it
was
sufficiently
sharp
i
had
neglected
to
furnish
myself
with
arms
but
i
perceived
this
to
be
my
only
chance
of
escaping
and
resolved
not
to
lose
the
opportunity
i
sprang
from
my
seat
darted
suddenly
upon
baptiste
and
clasping
my
hands
round
his
throat
pressed
it
so
forcibly
as
to
prevent
his
uttering
a
single
cry
you
may
remember
that
i
was
remarkable
at
salamanca
for
the
power
of
my
arm
it
now
rendered
me
an
essential
service
surprised
terrified
and
breathless
the
villain
was
by
no
means
an
equal
antagonist
i
threw
him
upon
the
ground
i
grasped
him
still
tighter
and
while
i
fixed
him
without
motion
upon
the
floor
marguerite
wresting
the
dagger
from
his
hand
plunged
it
repeatedly
in
his
heart
till
he
expired
no
sooner
was
this
horrible
but
necessary
act
perpetrated
than
marguerite
called
on
me
to
follow
her
'flight
is
our
only
refuge'
said
she
'quick
quick
away'
i
hesitated
not
to
obey
her
but
unwilling
to
leave
the
baroness
a
victim
to
the
vengeance
of
the
robbers
i
raised
her
in
my
arms
still
sleeping
and
hastened
after
marguerite
the
horses
of
the
banditti
were
fastened
near
the
door
my
conductress
sprang
upon
one
of
them
i
followed
her
example
placed
the
baroness
before
me
and
spurred
on
my
horse
our
only
hope
was
to
reach
strasbourg
which
was
much
nearer
than
the
perfidious
claude
had
assured
me
marguerite
was
well
acquainted
with
the
road
and
galloped
on
before
me
we
were
obliged
to
pass
by
the
barn
where
the
robbers
were
slaughtering
our
domestics
the
door
was
open
we
distinguished
the
shrieks
of
the
dying
and
imprecations
of
the
murderers
what
i
felt
at
that
moment
language
is
unable
to
describe
jacques
heard
the
trampling
of
our
horses
as
we
rushed
by
the
barn
he
flew
to
the
door
with
a
burning
torch
in
his
hand
and
easily
recognised
the
fugitives
'betrayed
betrayed'
he
shouted
to
his
companions
instantly
they
left
their
bloody
work
and
hastened
to
regain
their
horses
we
heard
no
more
i
buried
my
spurs
in
the
sides
of
my
courser
and
marguerite
goaded
on
hers
with
the
poignard
which
had
already
rendered
us
such
good
service
we
flew
like
lightning
and
gained
the
open
plains
already
was
strasbourg's
steeple
in
sight
when
we
heard
the
robbers
pursuing
us
marguerite
looked
back
and
distinguished
our
followers
descending
a
small
hill
at
no
great
distance
it
was
in
vain
that
we
urged
on
our
horses
the
noise
approached
nearer
with
every
moment
'we
are
lost'
she
exclaimed
'the
villains
gain
upon
us'
'on
on'
replied
i
'i
hear
the
trampling
of
horses
coming
from
the
town'
we
redoubled
our
exertions
and
were
soon
aware
of
a
numerous
band
of
cavaliers
who
came
towards
us
at
full
speed
they
were
on
the
point
of
passing
us
'stay
stay'
shrieked
marguerite
'save
us
for
god's
sake
save
us'
the
foremost
who
seemed
to
act
as
guide
immediately
reined
in
his
steed
''tis
she
'tis
she'
exclaimed
he
springing
upon
the
ground
'stop
my
lord
stop
they
are
safe
'tis
my
mother'
at
the
same
moment
marguerite
threw
herself
from
her
horse
clasped
him
in
her
arms
and
covered
him
with
kisses
the
other
cavaliers
stopped
at
the
exclamation
'the
baroness
lindenberg'
cried
another
of
the
strangers
eagerly
'where
is
she
is
she
not
with
you'
he
stopped
on
beholding
her
lying
senseless
in
my
arms
hastily
he
caught
her
from
me
the
profound
sleep
in
which
she
was
plunged
made
him
at
first
tremble
for
her
life
but
the
beating
of
her
heart
soon
reassured
him
'god
be
thanked'
said
he
'she
has
escaped
unhurt'
i
interrupted
his
joy
by
pointing
out
the
brigands
who
continued
to
approach
no
sooner
had
i
mentioned
them
than
the
greatest
part
of
the
company
which
appeared
to
be
chiefly
composed
of
soldiers
hastened
forward
to
meet
them
the
villains
stayed
not
to
receive
their
attack
perceiving
their
danger
they
turned
the
heads
of
their
horses
and
fled
into
the
wood
whither
they
were
followed
by
our
preservers
in
the
mean
while
the
stranger
whom
i
guessed
to
be
the
baron
lindenberg
after
thanking
me
for
my
care
of
his
lady
proposed
our
returning
with
all
speed
to
the
town
the
baroness
on
whom
the
effects
of
the
opiate
had
not
ceased
to
operate
was
placed
before
him
marguerite
and
her
son
remounted
their
horses
the
baron's
domestics
followed
and
we
soon
arrived
at
the
inn
where
he
had
taken
his
apartments
this
was
at
the
austrian
eagle
where
my
banker
whom
before
my
quitting
paris
i
had
apprised
of
my
intention
to
visit
strasbourg
had
prepared
lodgings
for
me
i
rejoiced
at
this
circumstance
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
cultivating
the
baron's
acquaintance
which
i
foresaw
would
be
of
use
to
me
in
germany
immediately
upon
our
arrival
the
lady
was
conveyed
to
bed
a
physician
was
sent
for
who
prescribed
a
medicine
likely
to
counteract
the
effects
of
the
sleepy
potion
and
after
it
had
been
poured
down
her
throat
she
was
committed
to
the
care
of
the
hostess
the
baron
then
addressed
himself
to
me
and
entreated
me
to
recount
the
particulars
of
this
adventure
i
complied
with
his
request
instantaneously
for
in
pain
respecting
stephano's
fate
whom
i
had
been
compelled
to
abandon
to
the
cruelty
of
the
banditti
i
found
it
impossible
for
me
to
repose
till
i
had
some
news
of
him
i
received
but
too
soon
the
intelligence
that
my
trusty
servant
had
perished
the
soldiers
who
had
pursued
the
brigands
returned
while
i
was
employed
in
relating
my
adventure
to
the
baron
by
their
account
i
found
that
the
robbers
had
been
overtaken
guilt
and
true
courage
are
incompatible
they
had
thrown
themselves
at
the
feet
of
their
pursuers
had
surrendered
themselves
without
striking
a
blow
had
discovered
their
secret
retreat
made
known
their
signals
by
which
the
rest
of
the
gang
might
be
seized
and
in
short
had
betrayed
ever
mark
of
cowardice
and
baseness
by
this
means
the
whole
of
the
band
consisting
of
near
sixty
persons
had
been
made
prisoners
bound
and
conducted
to
strasbourg
some
of
the
soldiers
hastened
to
the
cottage
one
of
the
banditti
serving
them
as
guide
their
first
visit
was
to
the
fatal
barn
where
they
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
two
of
the
baron's
servants
still
alive
though
desperately
wounded
the
rest
had
expired
beneath
the
swords
of
the
robbers
and
of
these
my
unhappy
stephano
was
one
alarmed
at
our
escape
the
robbers
in
their
haste
to
overtake
us
had
neglected
to
visit
the
cottage
in
consequence
the
soldiers
found
the
two
waiting-women
unhurt
and
buried
in
the
same
death-like
slumber
which
had
overpowered
their
mistress
there
was
nobody
else
found
in
the
cottage
except
a
child
not
above
four
years
old
which
the
soldiers
brought
away
with
them
we
were
busying
ourselves
with
conjectures
respecting
the
birth
of
this
little
unfortunate
when
marguerite
rushed
into
the
room
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
she
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
officer
who
was
making
us
this
report
and
blessed
him
a
thousand
times
for
the
preservation
of
her
child
when
the
first
burst
of
maternal
tenderness
was
over
i
besought
her
to
declare
by
what
means
she
had
been
united
to
a
man
whose
principles
seemed
so
totally
discordant
with
her
own
she
bent
her
eyes
downwards
and
wiped
a
few
tears
from
her
cheek
'gentlemen'
said
she
after
a
silence
of
some
minutes
'i
would
request
a
favour
of
you
you
have
a
right
to
know
on
whom
you
confer
an
obligation
i
will
not
therefore
stifle
a
confession
which
covers
me
with
shame
but
permit
me
to
comprise
it
in
as
few
words
as
possible
'i
was
born
in
strasbourg
of
respectable
parents
their
names
i
must
at
present
conceal
my
father
still
lives
and
deserves
not
to
be
involved
in
my
infamy
if
you
grant
my
request
you
shall
be
informed
of
my
family
name
a
villain
made
himself
master
of
my
affections
and
to
follow
him
i
quitted
my
father's
house
yet
though
my
passions
overpowered
my
virtue
i
sank
not
into
that
degeneracy
of
vice
but
too
commonly
the
lot
of
women
who
make
the
first
false
step
i
loved
my
seducer
dearly
loved
him
i
was
true
to
his
bed
this
baby
and
the
youth
who
warned
you
my
lord
baron
of
your
lady's
danger
are
the
pledges
of
our
affection
even
at
this
moment
i
lament
his
loss
though
'tis
to
him
that
i
owe
all
the
miseries
of
my
existence
'he
was
of
noble
birth
but
he
had
squandered
away
his
paternal
inheritance
his
relations
considered
him
as
a
disgrace
to
their
name
and
utterly
discarded
him
his
excesses
drew
upon
him
the
indignation
of
the
police
he
was
obliged
to
fly
from
strasbourg
and
saw
no
other
resource
from
beggary
than
an
union
with
the
banditti
who
infested
the
neighbouring
forest
and
whose
troop
was
chiefly
composed
of
young
men
of
family
in
the
same
predicament
with
himself
i
was
determined
not
to
forsake
him
i
followed
him
to
the
cavern
of
the
brigands
and
shared
with
him
the
misery
inseparable
from
a
life
of
pillage
but
though
i
was
aware
that
our
existence
was
supported
by
plunder
i
knew
not
all
the
horrible
circumstances
attached
to
my
lover's
profession
these
he
concealed
from
me
with
the
utmost
care
he
was
conscious
that
my
sentiments
were
not
sufficiently
depraved
to
look
without
horror
upon
assassination
he
supposed
and
with
justice
that
i
should
fly
with
detestation
from
the
embraces
of
a
murderer
eight
years
of
possession
had
not
abated
his
love
for
me
and
he
cautiously
removed
from
my
knowledge
every
circumstance
which
might
lead
me
to
suspect
the
crimes
in
which
he
but
too
often
participated
he
succeeded
perfectly
it
was
not
till
after
my
seducer's
death
that
i
discovered
his
hands
to
have
been
stained
with
the
blood
of
innocence
'one
fatal
night
he
was
brought
back
to
the
cavern
covered
with
wounds
he
received
them
in
attacking
an
english
traveller
whom
his
companions
immediately
sacrificed
to
their
resentment
he
had
only
time
to
entreat
my
pardon
for
all
the
sorrows
which
he
had
caused
me
he
pressed
my
hand
to
his
lips
and
expired
my
grief
was
inexpressible
as
soon
as
its
violence
abated
i
resolved
to
return
to
strasbourg
to
throw
myself
with
my
two
children
at
my
father's
feet
and
implore
his
forgiveness
though
i
little
hoped
to
obtain
it
what
was
my
consternation
when
informed
that
no
one
entrusted
with
the
secret
of
their
retreat
was
ever
permitted
to
quit
the
troop
of
the
banditti
that
i
must
give
up
all
hopes
of
ever
rejoining
society
and
consent
instantly
to
accepting
one
of
their
band
for
my
husband
my
prayers
and
remonstrances
were
vain
they
cast
lots
to
decide
to
whose
possession
i
should
fall
i
became
the
property
of
the
infamous
baptiste
a
robber
who
had
once
been
a
monk
pronounced
over
us
a
burlesque
rather
than
a
religious
ceremony
i
and
my
children
were
delivered
into
the
hands
of
my
new
husband
and
he
conveyed
us
immediately
to
his
home
'he
assured
me
that
he
had
long
entertained
for
me
the
most
ardent
regard
but
that
friendship
for
my
deceased
lover
had
obliged
him
to
stifle
his
desires
he
endeavoured
to
reconcile
me
to
my
fate
and
for
some
time
treated
me
with
respect
and
gentleness
at
length
finding
that
my
aversion
rather
increased
than
diminished
he
obtained
those
favours
by
violence
which
i
persisted
to
refuse
him
no
resource
remained
for
me
but
to
bear
my
sorrows
with
patience
i
was
conscious
that
i
deserved
them
but
too
well
flight
was
forbidden
my
children
were
in
the
power
of
baptiste
and
he
had
sworn
that
if
i
attempted
to
escape
their
lives
should
pay
for
it
i
had
had
too
many
opportunities
of
witnessing
the
barbarity
of
his
nature
to
doubt
his
fulfilling
his
oath
to
the
very
letter
sad
experience
had
convinced
me
of
the
horrors
of
my
situation
my
first
lover
had
carefully
concealed
them
from
me
baptiste
rather
rejoiced
in
opening
my
eyes
to
the
cruelties
of
his
profession
and
strove
to
familiarise
me
with
blood
and
slaughter
'my
nature
was
licentious
and
warm
but
not
cruel
my
conduct
had
been
imprudent
but
my
heart
was
not
unprincipled
judge
then
what
i
must
have
felt
at
being
a
continual
witness
of
crimes
the
most
horrible
and
revolting
judge
how
i
must
have
grieved
at
being
united
to
a
man
who
received
the
unsuspecting
guest
with
an
air
of
openness
and
hospitality
at
the
very
moment
that
he
meditated
his
destruction
chagrin
and
discontent
preyed
upon
my
constitution
the
few
charms
bestowed
on
me
by
nature
withered
away
and
the
dejection
of
my
countenance
denoted
the
sufferings
of
my
heart
i
was
tempted
a
thousand
times
to
put
an
end
to
my
existence
but
the
remembrance
of
my
children
held
my
hand
i
trembled
to
leave
my
dear
boys
in
my
tyrant's
power
and
trembled
yet
more
for
their
virtue
than
their
lives
the
second
was
still
too
young
to
benefit
by
my
instructions
but
in
the
heart
of
my
eldest
i
laboured
unceasingly
to
plant
those
principles
which
might
enable
him
to
avoid
the
crimes
of
his
parents
he
listened
to
me
with
docility
or
rather
with
eagerness
even
at
his
early
age
he
showed
that
he
was
not
calculated
for
the
society
of
villains
and
the
only
comfort
which
i
enjoyed
among
my
sorrows
was
to
witness
the
dawning
virtues
of
my
theodore
'such
was
my
situation
when
the
perfidy
of
don
alphonso's
postillion
conducted
him
to
the
cottage
his
youth
air
and
manners
interested
me
most
forcibly
in
his
behalf
the
absence
of
my
husband's
sons
gave
me
an
opportunity
which
i
had
long
wished
to
find
and
i
resolved
to
risque
every
thing
to
preserve
the
stranger
the
vigilance
of
baptiste
prevented
me
from
warning
don
alphonso
of
his
danger
i
knew
that
my
betraying
the
secret
would
be
immediately
punished
with
death
and
however
embittered
was
my
life
by
calamities
i
wanted
courage
to
sacrifice
it
for
the
sake
of
preserving
that
of
another
person
my
only
hope
rested
upon
procuring
succour
from
strasbourg
at
this
i
resolved
to
try
and
should
an
opportunity
offer
of
warning
don
alphonso
of
his
danger
unobserved
i
was
determined
to
seize
it
with
avidity
by
baptiste's
orders
i
went
upstairs
to
make
the
stranger's
bed
i
spread
upon
it
sheets
in
which
a
traveller
had
been
murdered
but
a
few
nights
before
and
which
still
were
stained
with
blood
i
hoped
that
these
marks
would
not
escape
the
vigilance
of
our
guest
and
that
he
would
collect
from
them
the
designs
of
my
perfidious
husband
neither
was
this
the
only
step
which
i
took
to
preserve
the
stranger
theodore
was
confined
to
his
bed
by
illness
i
stole
into
his
room
unobserved
by
my
tyrant
communicated
to
him
my
project
and
he
entered
into
it
with
eagerness
he
rose
in
spite
of
his
malady
and
dressed
himself
with
all
speed
i
fastened
one
of
the
sheets
round
his
arms
and
lowered
him
from
the
window
he
flew
to
the
stable
took
claude's
horse
and
hastened
to
strasbourg
had
he
been
accosted
by
the
banditti
he
was
to
have
declared
himself
sent
upon
a
message
by
baptiste
but
fortunately
he
reached
the
town
without
meeting
any
obstacle
immediately
upon
his
arrival
at
strasbourg
he
entreated
assistance
from
the
magistrature
his
story
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
at
length
came
to
the
knowledge
of
my
lord
the
baron
anxious
for
the
safety
of
his
lady
whom
he
knew
would
be
upon
the
road
that
evening
it
struck
him
that
she
might
have
fallen
into
the
power
of
the
robbers
he
accompanied
theodore
who
guided
the
soldiers
towards
the
cottage
and
arrived
just
in
time
to
save
us
from
falling
once
more
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies'
here
i
interrupted
marguerite
to
enquire
why
the
sleepy
potion
had
been
presented
to
me
she
said
that
baptiste
supposed
me
to
have
arms
about
me
and
wished
to
incapacitate
me
from
making
resistance
it
was
a
precaution
which
he
always
took
since
as
the
travellers
had
no
hopes
of
escaping
despair
would
have
incited
them
to
sell
their
lives
dearly
the
baron
then
desired
marguerite
to
inform
him
what
were
her
present
plans
i
joined
him
in
declaring
my
readiness
to
show
my
gratitude
to
her
for
the
preservation
of
my
life
'disgusted
with
a
world'
she
replied
'in
which
i
have
met
with
nothing
but
misfortunes
my
only
wish
is
to
retire
into
a
convent
but
first
i
must
provide
for
my
children
i
find
that
my
mother
is
no
more
probably
driven
to
an
untimely
grave
by
my
desertion
my
father
is
still
living
he
is
not
an
hard
man
perhaps
gentlemen
in
spite
of
my
ingratitude
and
imprudence
your
intercessions
may
induce
him
to
forgive
me
and
to
take
charge
of
his
unfortunate
grand-sons
if
you
obtain
this
boon
for
me
you
will
repay
my
services
a
thousand-fold'
both
the
baron
and
myself
assured
marguerite
that
we
would
spare
no
pains
to
obtain
her
pardon
and
that
even
should
her
father
be
inflexible
she
need
be
under
no
apprehensions
respecting
the
fate
of
her
children
i
engaged
myself
to
provide
for
theodore
and
the
baron
promised
to
take
the
youngest
under
his
protection
the
grateful
mother
thanked
us
with
tears
for
what
she
called
generosity
but
which
in
fact
was
no
more
than
a
proper
sense
of
our
obligations
to
her
she
then
left
the
room
to
put
her
little
boy
to
bed
whom
fatigue
and
sleep
had
compleatly
overpowered
the
baroness
on
recovering
and
being
informed
from
what
dangers
i
had
rescued
her
set
no
bounds
to
the
expressions
of
her
gratitude
she
was
joined
so
warmly
by
her
husband
in
pressing
me
to
accompany
them
to
their
castle
in
bavaria
that
i
found
it
impossible
to
resist
their
entreaties
during
a
week
which
we
passed
at
strasbourg
the
interests
of
marguerite
were
not
forgotten
in
our
application
to
her
father
we
succeeded
as
amply
as
we
could
wish
the
good
old
man
had
lost
his
wife
he
had
no
children
but
this
unfortunate
daughter
of
whom
he
had
received
no
news
for
almost
fourteen
years
he
was
surrounded
by
distant
relations
who
waited
with
impatience
for
his
decease
in
order
to
get
possession
of
his
money
when
therefore
marguerite
appeared
again
so
unexpectedly
he
considered
her
as
a
gift
from
heaven
he
received
her
and
her
children
with
open
arms
and
insisted
upon
their
establishing
themselves
in
his
house
without
delay
the
disappointed
cousins
were
obliged
to
give
place
the
old
man
would
not
hear
of
his
daughter's
retiring
into
a
convent
he
said
that
she
was
too
necessary
to
his
happiness
and
she
was
easily
persuaded
to
relinquish
her
design
but
no
persuasions
could
induce
theodore
to
give
up
the
plan
which
i
had
at
first
marked
out
for
him
he
had
attached
himself
to
me
most
sincerely
during
my
stay
at
strasbourg
and
when
i
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
it
he
besought
me
with
tears
to
take
him
into
my
service
he
set
forth
all
his
little
talents
in
the
most
favourable
colours
and
tried
to
convince
me
that
i
should
find
him
of
infinite
use
to
me
upon
the
road
i
was
unwilling
to
charge
myself
with
a
lad
but
scarcely
turned
of
thirteen
whom
i
knew
could
only
be
a
burthen
to
me
however
i
could
not
resist
the
entreaties
of
this
affectionate
youth
who
in
fact
possessed
a
thousand
estimable
qualities
with
some
difficulty
he
persuaded
his
relations
to
let
him
follow
me
and
that
permission
once
obtained
he
was
dubbed
with
the
title
of
my
page
having
passed
a
week
at
strasbourg
theodore
and
myself
set
out
for
bavaria
in
company
with
the
baron
and
his
lady
these
latter
as
well
as
myself
had
forced
marguerite
to
accept
several
presents
of
value
both
for
herself
and
her
youngest
son
on
leaving
her
i
promised
his
mother
faithfully
that
i
would
restore
theodore
to
her
within
the
year
i
have
related
this
adventure
at
length
lorenzo
that
you
might
understand
the
means
by
which
'the
adventurer
alphonso
d'alvarada

macbeth
continuation
of
the
history
of
don
raymond
my
journey
was
uncommonly
agreeable
i
found
the
baron
a
man
of
some
sense
but
little
knowledge
of
the
world
he
had
past
a
great
part
of
his
life
without
stirring
beyond
the
precincts
of
his
own
domains
and
consequently
his
manners
were
far
from
being
the
most
polished
but
he
was
hearty
good-humoured
and
friendly
his
attention
to
me
was
all
that
i
could
wish
and
i
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
his
behaviour
his
ruling
passion
was
hunting
which
he
had
brought
himself
to
consider
as
a
serious
occupation
and
when
talking
over
some
remarkable
chace
he
treated
the
subject
with
as
much
gravity
as
it
had
been
a
battle
on
which
the
fate
of
two
kingdoms
was
depending
i
happened
to
be
a
tolerable
sportsman
soon
after
my
arrival
at
lindenberg
i
gave
some
proofs
of
my
dexterity
the
baron
immediately
marked
me
down
for
a
man
of
genius
and
vowed
to
me
an
eternal
friendship
that
friendship
was
become
to
me
by
no
means
indifferent
at
the
castle
of
lindenberg
i
beheld
for
the
first
time
your
sister
the
lovely
agnes
for
me
whose
heart
was
unoccupied
and
who
grieved
at
the
void
to
see
her
and
to
love
her
were
the
same
i
found
in
agnes
all
that
was
requisite
to
secure
my
affection
she
was
then
scarcely
sixteen
her
person
light
and
elegant
was
already
formed
she
possessed
several
talents
in
perfection
particularly
those
of
music
and
drawing
her
character
was
gay
open
and
good-humoured
and
the
graceful
simplicity
of
her
dress
and
manners
formed
an
advantageous
contrast
to
the
art
and
studied
coquetry
of
the
parisian
dames
whom
i
had
just
quitted
from
the
moment
that
i
beheld
her
i
felt
the
most
lively
interest
in
her
fate
i
made
many
enquiries
respecting
her
of
the
baroness
'she
is
my
niece'
replied
that
lady
'you
are
still
ignorant
don
alphonso
that
i
am
your
countrywoman
i
am
sister
to
the
duke
of
medina
celi
agnes
is
the
daughter
of
my
second
brother
don
gaston
she
has
been
destined
to
the
convent
from
her
cradle
and
will
soon
make
her
profession
at
madrid'
here
lorenzo
interrupted
the
marquis
by
an
exclamation
of
surprise
'intended
for
the
convent
from
her
cradle'
said
he
'by
heaven
this
is
the
first
word
that
i
ever
heard
of
such
a
design'
'i
believe
it
my
dear
lorenzo'
answered
don
raymond
'but
you
must
listen
to
me
with
patience
you
will
not
be
less
surprised
when
i
relate
some
particulars
of
your
family
still
unknown
to
you
and
which
i
have
learnt
from
the
mouth
of
agnes
herself'
he
then
resumed
his
narrative
as
follows
you
cannot
but
be
aware
that
your
parents
were
unfortunately
slaves
to
the
grossest
superstition
when
this
foible
was
called
into
play
their
every
other
sentiment
their
every
other
passion
yielded
to
its
irresistible
strength
while
she
was
big
with
agnes
your
mother
was
seized
by
a
dangerous
illness
and
given
over
by
her
physicians
in
this
situation
donna
inesilla
vowed
that
if
she
recovered
from
her
malady
the
child
then
living
in
her
bosom
if
a
girl
should
be
dedicated
to
st
clare
if
a
boy
to
st
benedict
her
prayers
were
heard
she
got
rid
of
her
complaint
agnes
entered
the
world
alive
and
was
immediately
destined
to
the
service
of
st
clare
don
gaston
readily
chimed
in
with
his
lady's
wishes
but
knowing
the
sentiments
of
the
duke
his
brother
respecting
a
monastic
life
it
was
determined
that
your
sister's
destination
should
be
carefully
concealed
from
him
the
better
to
guard
the
secret
it
was
resolved
that
agnes
should
accompany
her
aunt
donna
rodolpha
into
germany
whither
that
lady
was
on
the
point
of
following
her
new-married
husband
baron
lindenberg
on
her
arrival
at
that
estate
the
young
agnes
was
put
into
a
convent
situated
but
a
few
miles
from
the
castle
the
nuns
to
whom
her
education
was
confided
performed
their
charge
with
exactitude
they
made
her
a
perfect
mistress
of
many
talents
and
strove
to
infuse
into
her
mind
a
taste
for
the
retirement
and
tranquil
pleasures
of
a
convent
but
a
secret
instinct
made
the
young
recluse
sensible
that
she
was
not
born
for
solitude
in
all
the
freedom
of
youth
and
gaiety
she
scrupled
not
to
treat
as
ridiculous
many
ceremonies
which
the
nuns
regarded
with
awe
and
she
was
never
more
happy
than
when
her
lively
imagination
inspired
her
with
some
scheme
to
plague
the
stiff
lady
abbess
or
the
ugly
ill-tempered
old
porteress
she
looked
with
disgust
upon
the
prospect
before
her
however
no
alternative
was
offered
to
her
and
she
submitted
to
the
decree
of
her
parents
though
not
without
secret
repining
that
repugnance
she
had
not
art
enough
to
conceal
long
don
gaston
was
informed
of
it
alarmed
lorenzo
lest
your
affection
for
her
should
oppose
itself
to
his
projects
and
lest
you
should
positively
object
to
your
sister's
misery
he
resolved
to
keep
the
whole
affair
from
your
knowledge
as
well
as
the
duke's
till
the
sacrifice
should
be
consummated
the
season
of
her
taking
the
veil
was
fixed
for
the
time
when
you
should
be
upon
your
travels
in
the
meanwhile
no
hint
was
dropped
of
donna
inesilla's
fatal
vow
your
sister
was
never
permitted
to
know
your
direction
all
your
letters
were
read
before
she
received
them
and
those
parts
effaced
which
were
likely
to
nourish
her
inclination
for
the
world
her
answers
were
dictated
either
by
her
aunt
or
by
dame
cunegonda
her
governess
these
particulars
i
learnt
partly
from
agnes
partly
from
the
baroness
herself
i
immediately
determined
upon
rescuing
this
lovely
girl
from
a
fate
so
contrary
to
her
inclinations
and
ill-suited
to
her
merit
i
endeavoured
to
ingratiate
myself
into
her
favour
i
boasted
of
my
friendship
and
intimacy
with
you
she
listened
to
me
with
avidity
she
seemed
to
devour
my
words
while
i
spoke
in
your
praise
and
her
eyes
thanked
me
for
my
affection
to
her
brother
my
constant
and
unremitted
attention
at
length
gained
me
her
heart
and
with
difficulty
i
obliged
her
to
confess
that
she
loved
me
when
however
i
proposed
her
quitting
the
castle
of
lindenberg
she
rejected
the
idea
in
positive
terms
'be
generous
alphonso'
she
said
'you
possess
my
heart
but
use
not
the
gift
ignobly
employ
not
your
ascendancy
over
me
in
persuading
me
to
take
a
step
at
which
i
should
hereafter
have
to
blush
i
am
young
and
deserted
my
brother
my
only
friend
is
separated
from
me
and
my
other
relations
act
with
me
as
my
enemies
take
pity
on
my
unprotected
situation
instead
of
seducing
me
to
an
action
which
would
cover
me
with
shame
strive
rather
to
gain
the
affections
of
those
who
govern
me
the
baron
esteems
you
my
aunt
to
others
ever
harsh
proud
and
contemptuous
remembers
that
you
rescued
her
from
the
hands
of
murderers
and
wears
with
you
alone
the
appearance
of
kindness
and
benignity
try
then
your
influence
over
my
guardians
if
they
consent
to
our
union
my
hand
is
yours
from
your
account
of
my
brother
i
cannot
doubt
your
obtaining
his
approbation
and
when
they
find
the
impossibility
of
executing
their
design
i
trust
that
my
parents
will
excuse
my
disobedience
and
expiate
by
some
other
sacrifice
my
mother's
fatal
vow'
from
the
first
moment
that
i
beheld
agnes
i
had
endeavoured
to
conciliate
the
favour
of
her
relations
authorised
by
the
confession
of
her
regard
i
redoubled
my
exertions
my
principal
battery
was
directed
against
the
baroness
it
was
easy
to
discover
that
her
word
was
law
in
the
castle
her
husband
paid
her
the
most
absolute
submission
and
considered
her
as
a
superior
being
she
was
about
forty
in
her
youth
she
had
been
a
beauty
but
her
charms
had
been
upon
that
large
scale
which
can
but
ill
sustain
the
shock
of
years
however
she
still
possessed
some
remains
of
them
her
understanding
was
strong
and
excellent
when
not
obscured
by
prejudice
which
unluckily
was
but
seldom
the
case
her
passions
were
violent
she
spared
no
pains
to
gratify
them
and
pursued
with
unremitting
vengeance
those
who
opposed
themselves
to
her
wishes
the
warmest
of
friends
the
most
inveterate
of
enemies
such
was
the
baroness
lindenberg
i
laboured
incessantly
to
please
her
unluckily
i
succeeded
but
too
well
she
seemed
gratified
by
my
attention
and
treated
me
with
a
distinction
accorded
by
her
to
no
one
else
one
of
my
daily
occupations
was
reading
to
her
for
several
hours
those
hours
i
should
much
rather
have
past
with
agnes
but
as
i
was
conscious
that
complaisance
for
her
aunt
would
advance
our
union
i
submitted
with
a
good
grace
to
the
penance
imposed
upon
me
donna
rodolpha's
library
was
principally
composed
of
old
spanish
romances
these
were
her
favourite
studies
and
once
a
day
one
of
these
unmerciful
volumes
was
put
regularly
into
my
hands
i
read
the
wearisome
adventures
of
'perceforest'
'tirante
the
white'
'palmerin
of
england'
and
'the
knight
of
the
sun'
till
the
book
was
on
the
point
of
falling
from
my
hands
through
ennui
however
the
increasing
pleasure
which
the
baroness
seemed
to
take
in
my
society
encouraged
me
to
persevere
and
latterly
she
showed
for
me
a
partiality
so
marked
that
agnes
advised
me
to
seize
the
first
opportunity
of
declaring
our
mutual
passion
to
her
aunt
one
evening
i
was
alone
with
donna
rodolpha
in
her
own
apartment
as
our
readings
generally
treated
of
love
agnes
was
never
permitted
to
assist
at
them
i
was
just
congratulating
myself
on
having
finished
'the
loves
of
tristan
and
the
queen
iseult----'
'ah
the
unfortunates'
cried
the
baroness
'how
say
you
segnor
do
you
think
it
possible
for
man
to
feel
an
attachment
so
disinterested
and
sincere'
'i
cannot
doubt
it'
replied
i
'my
own
heart
furnishes
me
with
the
certainty
ah
donna
rodolpha
might
i
but
hope
for
your
approbation
of
my
love
might
i
but
confess
the
name
of
my
mistress
without
incurring
your
resentment'
she
interrupted
me
'suppose
i
were
to
spare
you
that
confession
suppose
i
were
to
acknowledge
that
the
object
of
your
desires
is
not
unknown
to
me
suppose
i
were
to
say
that
she
returns
your
affection
and
laments
not
less
sincerely
than
yourself
the
unhappy
vows
which
separate
her
from
you'
'ah
donna
rodolpha'
i
exclaimed
throwing
myself
upon
my
knees
before
her
and
pressing
her
hand
to
my
lips
'you
have
discovered
my
secret
what
is
your
decision
must
i
despair
or
may
i
reckon
upon
your
favour'
she
withdrew
not
the
hand
which
i
held
but
she
turned
from
me
and
covered
her
face
with
the
other
'how
can
i
refuse
it
you'
she
replied
'ah
don
alphonso
i
have
long
perceived
to
whom
your
attentions
were
directed
but
till
now
i
perceived
not
the
impression
which
they
made
upon
my
heart
at
length
i
can
no
longer
hide
my
weakness
either
from
myself
or
from
you
i
yield
to
the
violence
of
my
passion
and
own
that
i
adore
you
for
three
long
months
i
stifled
my
desires
but
grown
stronger
by
resistance
i
submit
to
their
impetuosity
pride
fear
and
honour
respect
for
myself
and
my
engagements
to
the
baron
all
are
vanquished
i
sacrifice
them
to
my
love
for
you
and
it
still
seems
to
me
that
i
pay
too
mean
a
price
for
your
possession'
she
paused
for
an
answer--judge
my
lorenzo
what
must
have
been
my
confusion
at
this
discovery
i
at
once
saw
all
the
magnitude
of
this
obstacle
which
i
had
raised
myself
to
my
happiness
the
baroness
had
placed
those
attentions
to
her
own
account
which
i
had
merely
paid
her
for
the
sake
of
agnes
and
the
strength
of
her
expressions
the
looks
which
accompanied
them
and
my
knowledge
of
her
revengeful
disposition
made
me
tremble
for
myself
and
my
beloved
i
was
silent
for
some
minutes
i
knew
not
how
to
reply
to
her
declaration
i
could
only
resolve
to
clear
up
the
mistake
without
delay
and
for
the
present
to
conceal
from
her
knowledge
the
name
of
my
mistress
no
sooner
had
she
avowed
her
passion
than
the
transports
which
before
were
evident
in
my
features
gave
place
to
consternation
and
constraint
i
dropped
her
hand
and
rose
from
my
knees
the
change
in
my
countenance
did
not
escape
her
observation
'what
means
this
silence'
said
she
in
a
trembling
voice
'where
is
that
joy
which
you
led
me
to
expect'
'forgive
me
segnora'
i
answered
'if
what
necessity
forces
from
me
should
seem
harsh
and
ungrateful
to
encourage
you
in
an
error
which
however
it
may
flatter
myself
must
prove
to
you
the
source
of
disappointment
would
make
me
appear
criminal
in
every
eye
honour
obliges
me
to
inform
you
that
you
have
mistaken
for
the
solicitude
of
love
what
was
only
the
attention
of
friendship
the
latter
sentiment
is
that
which
i
wished
to
excite
in
your
bosom
to
entertain
a
warmer
respect
for
you
forbids
me
and
gratitude
for
the
baron's
generous
treatment
perhaps
these
reasons
would
not
be
sufficient
to
shield
me
from
your
attractions
were
it
not
that
my
affections
are
already
bestowed
upon
another
you
have
charms
segnora
which
might
captivate
the
most
insensible
no
heart
unoccupied
could
resist
them
happy
is
it
for
me
that
mine
is
no
longer
in
my
possession
or
i
should
have
to
reproach
myself
for
ever
with
having
violated
the
laws
of
hospitality
recollect
yourself
noble
lady
recollect
what
is
owed
by
you
to
honour
by
me
to
the
baron
and
replace
by
esteem
and
friendship
those
sentiments
which
i
never
can
return'
the
baroness
turned
pale
at
this
unexpected
and
positive
declaration
she
doubted
whether
she
slept
or
woke
at
length
recovering
from
her
surprise
consternation
gave
place
to
rage
and
the
blood
rushed
back
into
her
cheeks
with
violence
'villain'
she
cried
'monster
of
deceit
thus
is
the
avowal
of
my
love
received
is
it
thus
that
but
no
no
it
cannot
it
shall
not
be
alphonso
behold
me
at
your
feet
be
witness
of
my
despair
look
with
pity
on
a
woman
who
loves
you
with
sincere
affection
she
who
possesses
your
heart
how
has
she
merited
such
a
treasure
what
sacrifice
has
she
made
to
you
what
raises
her
above
rodolpha'
i
endeavoured
to
lift
her
from
her
knees
'for
god's
sake
segnora
restrain
these
transports
they
disgrace
yourself
and
me
your
exclamations
may
be
heard
and
your
secret
divulged
to
your
attendants
i
see
that
my
presence
only
irritates
you
permit
me
to
retire'
i
prepared
to
quit
the
apartment
the
baroness
caught
me
suddenly
by
the
arm
'and
who
is
this
happy
rival'
said
she
in
a
menacing
tone
'i
will
know
her
name
and
when
i
know
it

she
is
someone
in
my
power
you
entreated
my
favour
my
protection
let
me
but
find
her
let
me
but
know
who
dares
to
rob
me
of
your
heart
and
she
shall
suffer
every
torment
which
jealousy
and
disappointment
can
inflict
who
is
she
answer
me
this
moment
hope
not
to
conceal
her
from
my
vengeance
spies
shall
be
set
over
you
every
step
every
look
shall
be
watched
your
eyes
will
discover
my
rival
i
shall
know
her
and
when
she
is
found
tremble
alphonso
for
her
and
for
yourself'
as
she
uttered
these
last
words
her
fury
mounted
to
such
a
pitch
as
to
stop
her
powers
of
respiration
she
panted
groaned
and
at
length
fainted
away
as
she
was
falling
i
caught
her
in
my
arms
and
placed
her
upon
a
sopha
then
hastening
to
the
door
i
summoned
her
women
to
her
assistance
i
committed
her
to
their
care
and
seized
the
opportunity
of
escaping
agitated
and
confused
beyond
expression
i
bent
my
steps
towards
the
garden
the
benignity
with
which
the
baroness
had
listened
to
me
at
first
raised
my
hopes
to
the
highest
pitch
i
imagined
her
to
have
perceived
my
attachment
for
her
niece
and
to
approve
of
it
extreme
was
my
disappointment
at
understanding
the
true
purport
of
her
discourse
i
knew
not
what
course
to
take
the
superstition
of
the
parents
of
agnes
aided
by
her
aunt's
unfortunate
passion
seemed
to
oppose
such
obstacles
to
our
union
as
were
almost
insurmountable
as
i
past
by
a
low
parlour
whose
windows
looked
into
the
garden
through
the
door
which
stood
half
open
i
observed
agnes
seated
at
a
table
she
was
occupied
in
drawing
and
several
unfinished
sketches
were
scattered
round
her
i
entered
still
undetermined
whether
i
should
acquaint
her
with
the
declaration
of
the
baroness
'oh
is
it
only
you'
said
she
raising
her
head
'you
are
no
stranger
and
i
shall
continue
my
occupation
without
ceremony
take
a
chair
and
seat
yourself
by
me'
i
obeyed
and
placed
myself
near
the
table
unconscious
what
i
was
doing
and
totally
occupied
by
the
scene
which
had
just
passed
i
took
up
some
of
the
drawings
and
cast
my
eye
over
them
one
of
the
subjects
struck
me
from
its
singularity
it
represented
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
of
lindenberg
a
door
conducting
to
a
narrow
staircase
stood
half
open
in
the
foreground
appeared
a
groupe
of
figures
placed
in
the
most
grotesque
attitudes
terror
was
expressed
upon
every
countenance
here
was
one
upon
his
knees
with
his
eyes
cast
up
to
heaven
and
praying
most
devoutly
there
another
was
creeping
away
upon
all
fours
some
hid
their
faces
in
their
cloaks
or
the
laps
of
their
companions
some
had
concealed
themselves
beneath
a
table
on
which
the
remnants
of
a
feast
were
visible
while
others
with
gaping
mouths
and
eyes
wide-stretched
pointed
to
a
figure
supposed
to
have
created
this
disturbance
it
represented
a
female
of
more
than
human
stature
clothed
in
the
habit
of
some
religious
order
her
face
was
veiled
on
her
arm
hung
a
chaplet
of
beads
her
dress
was
in
several
places
stained
with
the
blood
which
trickled
from
a
wound
upon
her
bosom
in
one
hand
she
held
a
lamp
in
the
other
a
large
knife
and
she
seemed
advancing
towards
the
iron
gates
of
the
hall
'what
does
this
mean
agnes'
said
i
'is
this
some
invention
of
your
own'
she
cast
her
eye
upon
the
drawing
'oh
no'
she
replied
''tis
the
invention
of
much
wiser
heads
than
mine
but
can
you
possibly
have
lived
at
lindenberg
for
three
whole
months
without
hearing
of
the
bleeding
nun'
'you
are
the
first
who
ever
mentioned
the
name
to
me
pray
who
may
the
lady
be'
'that
is
more
than
i
can
pretend
to
tell
you
all
my
knowledge
of
her
history
comes
from
an
old
tradition
in
this
family
which
has
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
and
is
firmly
credited
throughout
the
baron's
domains
nay
the
baron
believes
it
himself
and
as
for
my
aunt
who
has
a
natural
turn
for
the
marvellous
she
would
sooner
doubt
the
veracity
of
the
bible
than
of
the
bleeding
nun
shall
i
tell
you
this
history'
i
answered
that
she
would
oblige
me
much
by
relating
it
she
resumed
her
drawing
and
then
proceeded
as
follows
in
a
tone
of
burlesqued
gravity
'it
is
surprising
that
in
all
the
chronicles
of
past
times
this
remarkable
personage
is
never
once
mentioned
fain
would
i
recount
to
you
her
life
but
unluckily
till
after
her
death
she
was
never
known
to
have
existed
then
first
did
she
think
it
necessary
to
make
some
noise
in
the
world
and
with
that
intention
she
made
bold
to
seize
upon
the
castle
of
lindenberg
having
a
good
taste
she
took
up
her
abode
in
the
best
room
of
the
house
and
once
established
there
she
began
to
amuse
herself
by
knocking
about
the
tables
and
chairs
in
the
middle
of
the
night
perhaps
she
was
a
bad
sleeper
but
this
i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
according
to
the
tradition
this
entertainment
commenced
about
a
century
ago
it
was
accompanied
with
shrieking
howling
groaning
swearing
and
many
other
agreeable
noises
of
the
same
kind
but
though
one
particular
room
was
more
especially
honoured
with
her
visits
she
did
not
entirely
confine
herself
to
it
she
occasionally
ventured
into
the
old
galleries
paced
up
and
down
the
spacious
halls
or
sometimes
stopping
at
the
doors
of
the
chambers
she
wept
and
wailed
there
to
the
universal
terror
of
the
inhabitants
in
these
nocturnal
excursions
she
was
seen
by
different
people
who
all
describe
her
appearance
as
you
behold
it
here
traced
by
the
hand
of
her
unworthy
historian'
the
singularity
of
this
account
insensibly
engaged
my
attention
'did
she
never
speak
to
those
who
met
her'
said
i
'not
she
the
specimens
indeed
which
she
gave
nightly
of
her
talents
for
conversation
were
by
no
means
inviting
sometimes
the
castle
rung
with
oaths
and
execrations
a
moment
after
she
repeated
her
paternoster
now
she
howled
out
the
most
horrible
blasphemies
and
then
chaunted
de
profundis
as
orderly
as
if
still
in
the
choir
in
short
she
seemed
a
mighty
capricious
being
but
whether
she
prayed
or
cursed
whether
she
was
impious
or
devout
she
always
contrived
to
terrify
her
auditors
out
of
their
senses
the
castle
became
scarcely
habitable
and
its
lord
was
so
frightened
by
these
midnight
revels
that
one
fine
morning
he
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
this
success
seemed
to
please
the
nun
mightily
for
now
she
made
more
noise
than
ever
but
the
next
baron
proved
too
cunning
for
her
he
made
his
appearance
with
a
celebrated
exorciser
in
his
hand
who
feared
not
to
shut
himself
up
for
a
night
in
the
haunted
chamber
there
it
seems
that
he
had
an
hard
battle
with
the
ghost
before
she
would
promise
to
be
quiet
she
was
obstinate
but
he
was
more
so
and
at
length
she
consented
to
let
the
inhabitants
of
the
castle
take
a
good
night's
rest
for
some
time
after
no
news
was
heard
of
her
but
at
the
end
of
five
years
the
exorciser
died
and
then
the
nun
ventured
to
peep
abroad
again
however
she
was
now
grown
much
more
tractable
and
well-behaved
she
walked
about
in
silence
and
never
made
her
appearance
above
once
in
five
years
this
custom
if
you
will
believe
the
baron
she
still
continues
he
is
fully
persuaded
that
on
the
fifth
of
may
of
every
fifth
year
as
soon
as
the
clock
strikes
one
the
door
of
the
haunted
chamber
opens
observe
that
this
room
has
been
shut
up
for
near
a
century
then
out
walks
the
ghostly
nun
with
her
lamp
and
dagger
she
descends
the
staircase
of
the
eastern
tower
and
crosses
the
great
hall
on
that
night
the
porter
always
leaves
the
gates
of
the
castle
open
out
of
respect
to
the
apparition
not
that
this
is
thought
by
any
means
necessary
since
she
could
easily
whip
through
the
keyhole
if
she
chose
it
but
merely
out
of
politeness
and
to
prevent
her
from
making
her
exit
in
a
way
so
derogatory
to
the
dignity
of
her
ghost-ship'
'and
whither
does
she
go
on
quitting
the
castle'
'to
heaven
i
hope
but
if
she
does
the
place
certainly
is
not
to
her
taste
for
she
always
returns
after
an
hour's
absence
the
lady
then
retires
to
her
chamber
and
is
quiet
for
another
five
years'
'and
you
believe
this
agnes'
'how
can
you
ask
such
a
question
no
no
alphonso
i
have
too
much
reason
to
lament
superstition's
influence
to
be
its
victim
myself
however
i
must
not
avow
my
incredulity
to
the
baroness
she
entertains
not
a
doubt
of
the
truth
of
this
history
as
to
dame
cunegonda
my
governess
she
protests
that
fifteen
years
ago
she
saw
the
spectre
with
her
own
eyes
she
related
to
me
one
evening
how
she
and
several
other
domestics
had
been
terrified
while
at
supper
by
the
appearance
of
the
bleeding
nun
as
the
ghost
is
called
in
the
castle
'tis
from
her
account
that
i
drew
this
sketch
and
you
may
be
certain
that
cunegonda
was
not
omitted
there
she
is
i
shall
never
forget
what
a
passion
she
was
in
and
how
ugly
she
looked
while
she
scolded
me
for
having
made
her
picture
so
like
herself'
here
she
pointed
to
a
burlesque
figure
of
an
old
woman
in
an
attitude
of
terror
in
spite
of
the
melancholy
which
oppressed
me
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
playful
imagination
of
agnes
she
had
perfectly
preserved
dame
cunegonda's
resemblance
but
had
so
much
exaggerated
every
fault
and
rendered
every
feature
so
irresistibly
laughable
that
i
could
easily
conceive
the
duenna's
anger
'the
figure
is
admirable
my
dear
agnes
i
knew
not
that
you
possessed
such
talents
for
the
ridiculous'
'stay
a
moment'
she
replied
'i
will
show
you
a
figure
still
more
ridiculous
than
dame
cunegonda's
if
it
pleases
you
you
may
dispose
of
it
as
seems
best
to
yourself'
she
rose
and
went
to
a
cabinet
at
some
little
distance
unlocking
a
drawer
she
took
out
a
small
case
which
she
opened
and
presented
to
me
'do
you
know
the
resemblance'
said
she
smiling
it
was
her
own
transported
at
the
gift
i
pressed
the
portrait
to
my
lips
with
passion
i
threw
myself
at
her
feet
and
declared
my
gratitude
in
the
warmest
and
most
affectionate
terms
she
listened
to
me
with
complaisance
and
assured
me
that
she
shared
my
sentiments
when
suddenly
she
uttered
a
loud
shriek
disengaged
the
hand
which
i
held
and
flew
from
the
room
by
a
door
which
opened
to
the
garden
amazed
at
this
abrupt
departure
i
rose
hastily
from
my
knees
i
beheld
with
confusion
the
baroness
standing
near
me
glowing
with
jealousy
and
almost
choaked
with
rage
on
recovering
from
her
swoon
she
had
tortured
her
imagination
to
discover
her
concealed
rival
no
one
appeared
to
deserve
her
suspicions
more
than
agnes
she
immediately
hastened
to
find
her
niece
tax
her
with
encouraging
my
addresses
and
assure
herself
whether
her
conjectures
were
well-grounded
unfortunately
she
had
already
seen
enough
to
need
no
other
confirmation
she
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
room
at
the
precise
moment
when
agnes
gave
me
her
portrait
she
heard
me
profess
an
everlasting
attachment
to
her
rival
and
saw
me
kneeling
at
her
feet
she
advanced
to
separate
us
we
were
too
much
occupied
by
each
other
to
perceive
her
approach
and
were
not
aware
of
it
till
agnes
beheld
her
standing
by
my
side
rage
on
the
part
of
donna
rodolpha
embarrassment
on
mine
for
some
time
kept
us
both
silent
the
lady
recovered
herself
first
'my
suspicions
then
were
just'
said
she
'the
coquetry
of
my
niece
has
triumphed
and
'tis
to
her
that
i
am
sacrificed
in
one
respect
however
i
am
fortunate
i
shall
not
be
the
only
one
who
laments
a
disappointed
passion
you
too
shall
know
what
it
is
to
love
without
hope
i
daily
expect
orders
for
restoring
agnes
to
her
parents
immediately
upon
her
arrival
in
spain
she
will
take
the
veil
and
place
an
insuperable
barrier
to
your
union
you
may
spare
your
supplications'
she
continued
perceiving
me
on
the
point
of
speaking
'my
resolution
is
fixed
and
immoveable
your
mistress
shall
remain
a
close
prisoner
in
her
chamber
till
she
exchanges
this
castle
for
the
cloister
solitude
will
perhaps
recall
her
to
a
sense
of
her
duty
but
to
prevent
your
opposing
that
wished
event
i
must
inform
you
don
alphonso
that
your
presence
here
is
no
longer
agreeable
either
to
the
baron
or
myself
it
was
not
to
talk
nonsense
to
my
niece
that
your
relations
sent
you
to
germany
your
business
was
to
travel
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
impede
any
longer
so
excellent
a
design
farewell
segnor
remember
that
tomorrow
morning
we
meet
for
the
last
time'
having
said
this
she
darted
upon
me
a
look
of
pride
contempt
and
malice
and
quitted
the
apartment
i
also
retired
to
mine
and
consumed
the
night
in
planning
the
means
of
rescuing
agnes
from
the
power
of
her
tyrannical
aunt
after
the
positive
declaration
of
its
mistress
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
make
a
longer
stay
at
the
castle
of
lindenberg
accordingly
i
the
next
day
announced
my
immediate
departure
the
baron
declared
that
it
gave
him
sincere
pain
and
he
expressed
himself
in
my
favour
so
warmly
that
i
endeavoured
to
win
him
over
to
my
interest
scarcely
had
i
mentioned
the
name
of
agnes
when
he
stopped
me
short
and
said
that
it
was
totally
out
of
his
power
to
interfere
in
the
business
i
saw
that
it
was
in
vain
to
argue
the
baroness
governed
her
husband
with
despotic
sway
and
i
easily
perceived
that
she
had
prejudiced
him
against
the
match
agnes
did
not
appear
i
entreated
permission
to
take
leave
of
her
but
my
prayer
was
rejected
i
was
obliged
to
depart
without
seeing
her
at
quitting
him
the
baron
shook
my
hand
affectionately
and
assured
me
that
as
soon
as
his
niece
was
gone
i
might
consider
his
house
as
my
own
'farewell
don
alphonso'
said
the
baroness
and
stretched
out
her
hand
to
me
i
took
it
and
offered
to
carry
it
to
my
lips
she
prevented
me
her
husband
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
out
of
hearing
'take
care
of
yourself'
she
continued
'my
love
is
become
hatred
and
my
wounded
pride
shall
not
be
unatoned
go
where
you
will
my
vengeance
shall
follow
you'
she
accompanied
these
words
with
a
look
sufficient
to
make
me
tremble
i
answered
not
but
hastened
to
quit
the
castle
as
my
chaise
drove
out
of
the
court
i
looked
up
to
the
windows
of
your
sister's
chamber
nobody
was
to
be
seen
there
i
threw
myself
back
despondent
in
my
carriage
i
was
attended
by
no
other
servants
than
a
frenchman
whom
i
had
hired
at
strasbourg
in
stephano's
room
and
my
little
page
whom
i
before
mentioned
to
you
the
fidelity
intelligence
and
good
temper
of
theodore
had
already
made
him
dear
to
me
but
he
now
prepared
to
lay
an
obligation
on
me
which
made
me
look
upon
him
as
a
guardian
genius
scarcely
had
we
proceeded
half
a
mile
from
the
castle
when
he
rode
up
to
the
chaise-door
'take
courage
segnor'
said
he
in
spanish
which
he
had
already
learnt
to
speak
with
fluency
and
correctness
'while
you
were
with
the
baron
i
watched
the
moment
when
dame
cunegonda
was
below
stairs
and
mounted
into
the
chamber
over
that
of
donna
agnes
i
sang
as
loud
as
i
could
a
little
german
air
well-known
to
her
hoping
that
she
would
recollect
my
voice
i
was
not
disappointed
for
i
soon
heard
her
window
open
i
hastened
to
let
down
a
string
with
which
i
had
provided
myself
upon
hearing
the
casement
closed
again
i
drew
up
the
string
and
fastened
to
it
i
found
this
scrap
of
paper'
he
then
presented
me
with
a
small
note
addressed
to
me
i
opened
it
with
impatience
it
contained
the
following
words
written
in
pencil
conceal
yourself
for
the
next
fortnight
in
some
neighbouring
village
my
aunt
will
believe
you
to
have
quitted
lindenberg
and
i
shall
be
restored
to
liberty
i
will
be
in
the
west
pavilion
at
twelve
on
the
night
of
the
thirtieth
fail
not
to
be
there
and
we
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
concerting
our
future
plans
adieu
agnes
at
perusing
these
lines
my
transports
exceeded
all
bounds
neither
did
i
set
any
to
the
expressions
of
gratitude
which
i
heaped
upon
theodore
in
fact
his
address
and
attention
merited
my
warmest
praise
you
will
readily
believe
that
i
had
not
entrusted
him
with
my
passion
for
agnes
but
the
arch
youth
had
too
much
discernment
not
to
discover
my
secret
and
too
much
discretion
not
to
conceal
his
knowledge
of
it
he
observed
in
silence
what
was
going
on
nor
strove
to
make
himself
an
agent
in
the
business
till
my
interests
required
his
interference
i
equally
admired
his
judgment
his
penetration
his
address
and
his
fidelity
this
was
not
the
first
occasion
in
which
i
had
found
him
of
infinite
use
and
i
was
every
day
more
convinced
of
his
quickness
and
capacity
during
my
short
stay
at
strasbourg
he
had
applied
himself
diligently
to
learning
the
rudiments
of
spanish
he
continued
to
study
it
and
with
so
much
success
that
he
spoke
it
with
the
same
facility
as
his
native
language
he
past
the
greatest
part
of
his
time
in
reading
he
had
acquired
much
information
for
his
age
and
united
the
advantages
of
a
lively
countenance
and
prepossessing
figure
to
an
excellent
understanding
and
the
very
best
of
hearts
he
is
now
fifteen
he
is
still
in
my
service
and
when
you
see
him
i
am
sure
that
he
will
please
you
but
excuse
this
digression
i
return
to
the
subject
which
i
quitted
i
obeyed
the
instructions
of
agnes
i
proceeded
to
munich
there
i
left
my
chaise
under
the
care
of
lucas
my
french
servant
and
then
returned
on
horseback
to
a
small
village
about
four
miles
distant
from
the
castle
of
lindenberg
upon
arriving
there
a
story
was
related
to
the
host
at
whose
inn
i
descended
which
prevented
his
wondering
at
my
making
so
long
a
stay
in
his
house
the
old
man
fortunately
was
credulous
and
incurious
he
believed
all
i
said
and
sought
to
know
no
more
than
what
i
thought
proper
to
tell
him
nobody
was
with
me
but
theodore
both
were
disguised
and
as
we
kept
ourselves
close
we
were
not
suspected
to
be
other
than
what
we
seemed
in
this
manner
the
fortnight
passed
away
during
that
time
i
had
the
pleasing
conviction
that
agnes
was
once
more
at
liberty
she
past
through
the
village
with
dame
cunegonda
she
seemed
in
health
and
spirits
and
talked
to
her
companion
without
any
appearance
of
constraint
'who
are
those
ladies'
said
i
to
my
host
as
the
carriage
past
'baron
lindenberg's
niece
with
her
governess'
he
replied
'she
goes
regularly
every
friday
to
the
convent
of
st
catharine
in
which
she
was
brought
up
and
which
is
situated
about
a
mile
from
hence'
you
may
be
certain
that
i
waited
with
impatience
for
the
ensuing
friday
i
again
beheld
my
lovely
mistress
she
cast
her
eyes
upon
me
as
she
passed
the
inn-door
a
blush
which
overspread
her
cheek
told
me
that
in
spite
of
my
disguise
i
had
been
recognised
i
bowed
profoundly
she
returned
the
compliment
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
as
if
made
to
one
inferior
and
looked
another
way
till
the
carriage
was
out
of
sight
the
long-expected
long-wished
for
night
arrived
it
was
calm
and
the
moon
was
at
the
full
as
soon
as
the
clock
struck
eleven
i
hastened
to
my
appointment
determined
not
to
be
too
late
theodore
had
provided
a
ladder
i
ascended
the
garden
wall
without
difficulty
the
page
followed
me
and
drew
the
ladder
after
us
i
posted
myself
in
the
west
pavilion
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
approach
of
agnes
every
breeze
that
whispered
every
leaf
that
fell
i
believed
to
be
her
footstep
and
hastened
to
meet
her
thus
was
i
obliged
to
pass
a
full
hour
every
minute
of
which
appeared
to
me
an
age
the
castle
bell
at
length
tolled
twelve
and
scarcely
could
i
believe
the
night
to
be
no
further
advanced
another
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
and
i
heard
the
light
foot
of
my
mistress
approaching
the
pavilion
with
precaution
i
flew
to
receive
her
and
conducted
her
to
a
seat
i
threw
myself
at
her
feet
and
was
expressing
my
joy
at
seeing
her
when
she
thus
interrupted
me
'we
have
no
time
to
lose
alphonso
the
moments
are
precious
for
though
no
more
a
prisoner
cunegonda
watches
my
every
step
an
express
is
arrived
from
my
father
i
must
depart
immediately
for
madrid
and
'tis
with
difficulty
that
i
have
obtained
a
week's
delay
the
superstition
of
my
parents
supported
by
the
representations
of
my
cruel
aunt
leaves
me
no
hope
of
softening
them
to
compassion
in
this
dilemma
i
have
resolved
to
commit
myself
to
your
honour
god
grant
that
you
may
never
give
me
cause
to
repent
my
resolution
flight
is
my
only
resource
from
the
horrors
of
a
convent
and
my
imprudence
must
be
excused
by
the
urgency
of
the
danger
now
listen
to
the
plan
by
which
i
hope
to
effect
my
escape
'we
are
now
at
the
thirtieth
of
april
on
the
fifth
day
from
this
the
visionary
nun
is
expected
to
appear
in
my
last
visit
to
the
convent
i
provided
myself
with
a
dress
proper
for
the
character
a
friend
whom
i
have
left
there
and
to
whom
i
made
no
scruple
to
confide
my
secret
readily
consented
to
supply
me
with
a
religious
habit
provide
a
carriage
and
be
with
it
at
a
little
distance
from
the
great
gate
of
the
castle
as
soon
as
the
clock
strikes
'one'
i
shall
quit
my
chamber
drest
in
the
same
apparel
as
the
ghost
is
supposed
to
wear
whoever
meets
me
will
be
too
much
terrified
to
oppose
my
escape
i
shall
easily
reach
the
door
and
throw
myself
under
your
protection
thus
far
success
is
certain
but
oh
alphonso
should
you
deceive
me
should
you
despise
my
imprudence
and
reward
it
with
ingratitude
the
world
will
not
hold
a
being
more
wretched
than
myself
i
feel
all
the
dangers
to
which
i
shall
be
exposed
i
feel
that
i
am
giving
you
a
right
to
treat
me
with
levity
but
i
rely
upon
your
love
upon
your
honour
the
step
which
i
am
on
the
point
of
taking
will
incense
my
relations
against
me
should
you
desert
me
should
you
betray
the
trust
reposed
in
you
i
shall
have
no
friend
to
punish
your
insult
or
support
my
cause
on
yourself
alone
rests
all
my
hope
and
if
your
own
heart
does
not
plead
in
my
behalf
i
am
undone
for
ever'
the
tone
in
which
she
pronounced
these
words
was
so
touching
that
in
spite
of
my
joy
at
receiving
her
promise
to
follow
me
i
could
not
help
being
affected
i
also
repined
in
secret
at
not
having
taken
the
precaution
to
provide
a
carriage
at
the
village
in
which
case
i
might
have
carried
off
agnes
that
very
night
such
an
attempt
was
now
impracticable
neither
carriage
or
horses
were
to
be
procured
nearer
than
munich
which
was
distant
from
lindenberg
two
good
days
journey
i
was
therefore
obliged
to
chime
in
with
her
plan
which
in
truth
seemed
well
arranged
her
disguise
would
secure
her
from
being
stopped
in
quitting
the
castle
and
would
enable
her
to
step
into
the
carriage
at
the
very
gate
without
difficulty
or
losing
time
agnes
reclined
her
head
mournfully
upon
my
shoulder
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
i
saw
tears
flowing
down
her
cheek
i
strove
to
dissipate
her
melancholy
and
encouraged
her
to
look
forward
to
the
prospect
of
happiness
i
protested
in
the
most
solemn
terms
that
her
virtue
and
innocence
would
be
safe
in
my
keeping
and
that
till
the
church
had
made
her
my
lawful
wife
her
honour
should
be
held
by
me
as
sacred
as
a
sister's
i
told
her
that
my
first
care
should
be
to
find
you
out
lorenzo
and
reconcile
you
to
our
union
and
i
was
continuing
to
speak
in
the
same
strain
when
a
noise
without
alarmed
me
suddenly
the
door
of
the
pavilion
was
thrown
open
and
cunegonda
stood
before
us
she
had
heard
agnes
steal
out
of
her
chamber
followed
her
into
the
garden
and
perceived
her
entering
the
pavilion
favoured
by
the
trees
which
shaded
it
and
unperceived
by
theodore
who
waited
at
a
little
distance
she
had
approached
in
silence
and
overheard
our
whole
conversation
'admirable'
cried
cunegonda
in
a
voice
shrill
with
passion
while
agnes
uttered
a
loud
shriek
'by
st
barbara
young
lady
you
have
an
excellent
invention
you
must
personate
the
bleeding
nun
truly
what
impiety
what
incredulity
marry
i
have
a
good
mind
to
let
you
pursue
your
plan
when
the
real
ghost
met
you
i
warrant
you
would
be
in
a
pretty
condition
don
alphonso
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
seducing
a
young
ignorant
creature
to
leave
her
family
and
friends
however
for
this
time
at
least
i
shall
mar
your
wicked
designs
the
noble
lady
shall
be
informed
of
the
whole
affair
and
agnes
must
defer
playing
the
spectre
till
a
better
opportunity
farewell
segnor--
donna
agnes
let
me
have
the
honour
of
conducting
your
ghost-ship
back
to
your
apartment'
she
approached
the
sopha
on
which
her
trembling
pupil
was
seated
took
her
by
the
hand
and
prepared
to
lead
her
from
the
pavilion
i
detained
her
and
strove
by
entreaties
soothing
promises
and
flattery
to
win
her
to
my
party
but
finding
all
that
i
could
say
of
no
avail
i
abandoned
the
vain
attempt
'your
obstinacy
must
be
its
own
punishment'
said
i
'but
one
resource
remains
to
save
agnes
and
myself
and
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
employ
it'
terrified
at
this
menace
she
again
endeavoured
to
quit
the
pavilion
but
i
seized
her
by
the
wrist
and
detained
her
forcibly
at
the
same
moment
theodore
who
had
followed
her
into
the
room
closed
the
door
and
prevented
her
escape
i
took
the
veil
of
agnes
i
threw
it
round
the
duenna's
head
who
uttered
such
piercing
shrieks
that
in
spite
of
our
distance
from
the
castle
i
dreaded
their
being
heard
at
length
i
succeeded
in
gagging
her
so
compleatly
that
she
could
not
produce
a
single
sound
theodore
and
myself
with
some
difficulty
next
contrived
to
bind
her
hands
and
feet
with
our
handkerchiefs
and
i
advised
agnes
to
regain
her
chamber
with
all
diligence
i
promised
that
no
harm
should
happen
to
cunegonda
bad
her
remember
that
on
the
fifth
of
may
i
should
be
in
waiting
at
the
great
gate
of
the
castle
and
took
of
her
an
affectionate
farewell
trembling
and
uneasy
she
had
scarce
power
enough
to
signify
her
consent
to
my
plans
and
fled
back
to
her
apartment
in
disorder
and
confusion
in
the
meanwhile
theodore
assisted
me
in
carrying
off
my
antiquated
prize
she
was
hoisted
over
the
wall
placed
before
me
upon
my
horse
like
a
portmanteau
and
i
galloped
away
with
her
from
the
castle
of
lindenberg
the
unlucky
duenna
never
had
made
a
more
disagreeable
journey
in
her
life
she
was
jolted
and
shaken
till
she
was
become
little
more
than
an
animated
mummy
not
to
mention
her
fright
when
we
waded
through
a
small
river
through
which
it
was
necessary
to
pass
in
order
to
regain
the
village
before
we
reached
the
inn
i
had
already
determined
how
to
dispose
of
the
troublesome
cunegonda
we
entered
the
street
in
which
the
inn
stood
and
while
the
page
knocked
i
waited
at
a
little
distance
the
landlord
opened
the
door
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
'give
me
the
light'
said
theodore
'my
master
is
coming'
he
snatched
the
lamp
hastily
and
purposely
let
it
fall
upon
the
ground
the
landlord
returned
to
the
kitchen
to
re-light
the
lamp
leaving
the
door
open
i
profited
by
the
obscurity
sprang
from
my
horse
with
cunegonda
in
my
arms
darted
up
stairs
reached
my
chamber
unperceived
and
unlocking
the
door
of
a
spacious
closet
stowed
her
within
it
and
then
turned
the
key
the
landlord
and
theodore
soon
after
appeared
with
lights
the
former
expressed
himself
a
little
surprised
at
my
returning
so
late
but
asked
no
impertinent
questions
he
soon
quitted
the
room
and
left
me
to
exult
in
the
success
of
my
undertaking
i
immediately
paid
a
visit
to
my
prisoner
i
strove
to
persuade
her
submitting
with
patience
to
her
temporary
confinement
my
attempt
was
unsuccessful
unable
to
speak
or
move
she
expressed
her
fury
by
her
looks
and
except
at
meals
i
never
dared
to
unbind
her
or
release
her
from
the
gag
at
such
times
i
stood
over
her
with
a
drawn
sword
and
protested
that
if
she
uttered
a
single
cry
i
would
plunge
it
in
her
bosom
as
soon
as
she
had
done
eating
the
gag
was
replaced
i
was
conscious
that
this
proceeding
was
cruel
and
could
only
be
justified
by
the
urgency
of
circumstances
as
to
theodore
he
had
no
scruples
upon
the
subject
cunegonda's
captivity
entertained
him
beyond
measure
during
his
abode
in
the
castle
a
continual
warfare
had
been
carried
on
between
him
and
the
duenna
and
now
that
he
found
his
enemy
so
absolutely
in
his
power
he
triumphed
without
mercy
he
seemed
to
think
of
nothing
but
how
to
find
out
new
means
of
plaguing
her
sometimes
he
affected
to
pity
her
misfortune
then
laughed
at
abused
and
mimicked
her
he
played
her
a
thousand
tricks
each
more
provoking
than
the
other
and
amused
himself
by
telling
her
that
her
elopement
must
have
occasioned
much
surprise
at
the
baron's
this
was
in
fact
the
case
no
one
except
agnes
could
imagine
what
was
become
of
dame
cunegonda
every
hole
and
corner
was
searched
for
her
the
ponds
were
dragged
and
the
woods
underwent
a
thorough
examination
still
no
dame
cunegonda
made
her
appearance
agnes
kept
the
secret
and
i
kept
the
duenna
the
baroness
therefore
remained
in
total
ignorance
respecting
the
old
woman's
fate
but
suspected
her
to
have
perished
by
suicide
thus
past
away
five
days
during
which
i
had
prepared
every
thing
necessary
for
my
enterprise
on
quitting
agnes
i
had
made
it
my
first
business
to
dispatch
a
peasant
with
a
letter
to
lucas
at
munich
ordering
him
to
take
care
that
a
coach
and
four
should
arrive
about
ten
o'clock
on
the
fifth
of
may
at
the
village
of
rosenwald
he
obeyed
my
instructions
punctually
the
equipage
arrived
at
the
time
appointed
as
the
period
of
her
lady's
elopement
drew
nearer
cunegonda's
rage
increased
i
verily
believe
that
spight
and
passion
would
have
killed
her
had
i
not
luckily
discovered
her
prepossession
in
favour
of
cherry
brandy
with
this
favourite
liquor
she
was
plentifully
supplied
and
theodore
always
remaining
to
guard
her
the
gag
was
occasionally
removed
the
liquor
seemed
to
have
a
wonderful
effect
in
softening
the
acrimony
of
her
nature
and
her
confinement
not
admitting
of
any
other
amusement
she
got
drunk
regularly
once
a
day
just
by
way
of
passing
the
time
the
fifth
of
may
arrived
a
period
by
me
never
to
be
forgotten
before
the
clock
struck
twelve
i
betook
myself
to
the
scene
of
action
theodore
followed
me
on
horseback
i
concealed
the
carriage
in
a
spacious
cavern
of
the
hill
on
whose
brow
the
castle
was
situated
this
cavern
was
of
considerable
depth
and
among
the
peasants
was
known
by
the
name
of
lindenberg
hole
the
night
was
calm
and
beautiful
the
moonbeams
fell
upon
the
antient
towers
of
the
castle
and
shed
upon
their
summits
a
silver
light
all
was
still
around
me
nothing
was
to
be
heard
except
the
night
breeze
sighing
among
the
leaves
the
distant
barking
of
village
dogs
or
the
owl
who
had
established
herself
in
a
nook
of
the
deserted
eastern
turret
i
heard
her
melancholy
shriek
and
looked
upwards
she
sat
upon
the
ride
of
a
window
which
i
recognized
to
be
that
of
the
haunted
room
this
brought
to
my
remembrance
the
story
of
the
bleeding
nun
and
i
sighed
while
i
reflected
on
the
influence
of
superstition
and
weakness
of
human
reason
suddenly
i
heard
a
faint
chorus
steal
upon
the
silence
of
the
night
'what
can
occasion
that
noise
theodore'
'a
stranger
of
distinction'
replied
he
'passed
through
the
village
today
in
his
way
to
the
castle
he
is
reported
to
be
the
father
of
donna
agnes
doubtless
the
baron
has
given
an
entertainment
to
celebrate
his
arrival'
the
castle
bell
announced
the
hour
of
midnight
this
was
the
usual
signal
for
the
family
to
retire
to
bed
soon
after
i
perceived
lights
in
the
castle
moving
backwards
and
forwards
in
different
directions
i
conjectured
the
company
to
be
separating
i
could
hear
the
heavy
doors
grate
as
they
opened
with
difficulty
and
as
they
closed
again
the
rotten
casements
rattled
in
their
frames
the
chamber
of
agnes
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
castle
i
trembled
lest
she
should
have
failed
in
obtaining
the
key
of
the
haunted
room
through
this
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
pass
in
order
to
reach
the
narrow
staircase
by
which
the
ghost
was
supposed
to
descend
into
the
great
hall
agitated
by
this
apprehension
i
kept
my
eyes
constantly
fixed
upon
the
window
where
i
hoped
to
perceive
the
friendly
glare
of
a
lamp
borne
by
agnes
i
now
heard
the
massy
gates
unbarred
by
the
candle
in
his
hand
i
distinguished
old
conrad
the
porter
he
set
the
portal
doors
wide
open
and
retired
the
lights
in
the
castle
gradually
disappeared
and
at
length
the
whole
building
was
wrapt
in
darkness
while
i
sat
upon
a
broken
ridge
of
the
hill
the
stillness
of
the
scene
inspired
me
with
melancholy
ideas
not
altogether
unpleasing
the
castle
which
stood
full
in
my
sight
formed
an
object
equally
awful
and
picturesque
its
ponderous
walls
tinged
by
the
moon
with
solemn
brightness
its
old
and
partly-ruined
towers
lifting
themselves
into
the
clouds
and
seeming
to
frown
on
the
plains
around
them
its
lofty
battlements
oergrown
with
ivy
and
folding
gates
expanding
in
honour
of
the
visionary
inhabitant
made
me
sensible
of
a
sad
and
reverential
horror
yet
did
not
these
sensations
occupy
me
so
fully
as
to
prevent
me
from
witnessing
with
impatience
the
slow
progress
of
time
i
approached
the
castle
and
ventured
to
walk
round
it
a
few
rays
of
light
still
glimmered
in
the
chamber
of
agnes
i
observed
them
with
joy
i
was
still
gazing
upon
them
when
i
perceived
a
figure
draw
near
the
window
and
the
curtain
was
carefully
closed
to
conceal
the
lamp
which
burned
there
convinced
by
this
observation
that
agnes
had
not
abandoned
our
plan
i
returned
with
a
light
heart
to
my
former
station
the
half-hour
struck
the
three-quarters
struck
my
bosom
beat
high
with
hope
and
expectation
at
length
the
wished-for
sound
was
heard
the
bell
tolled
'one'
and
the
mansion
echoed
with
the
noise
loud
and
solemn
i
looked
up
to
the
casement
of
the
haunted
chamber
scarcely
had
five
minutes
elapsed
when
the
expected
light
appeared
i
was
now
close
to
the
tower
the
window
was
not
so
far
from
the
ground
but
that
i
fancied
i
perceived
a
female
figure
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
moving
slowly
along
the
apartment
the
light
soon
faded
away
and
all
was
again
dark
and
gloomy
occasional
gleams
of
brightness
darted
from
the
staircase
windows
as
the
lovely
ghost
past
by
them
i
traced
the
light
through
the
hall
it
reached
the
portal
and
at
length
i
beheld
agnes
pass
through
the
folding
gates
she
was
habited
exactly
as
she
had
described
the
spectre
a
chaplet
of
beads
hung
upon
her
arm
her
head
was
enveloped
in
a
long
white
veil
her
nun's
dress
was
stained
with
blood
and
she
had
taken
care
to
provide
herself
with
a
lamp
and
dagger
she
advanced
towards
the
spot
where
i
stood
i
flew
to
meet
her
and
clasped
her
in
my
arms
'agnes'
said
i
while
i
pressed
her
to
my
bosom
agnes
agnes
thou
art
mine
agnes
agnes
i
am
thine
in
my
veins
while
blood
shall
roll
thou
art
mine
i
am
thine
thine
my
body
thine
my
soul
terrified
and
breathless
she
was
unable
to
speak
she
dropt
her
lamp
and
dagger
and
sank
upon
my
bosom
in
silence
i
raised
her
in
my
arms
and
conveyed
her
to
the
carriage
theodore
remained
behind
in
order
to
release
dame
cunegonda
i
also
charged
him
with
a
letter
to
the
baroness
explaining
the
whole
affair
and
entreating
her
good
offices
in
reconciling
don
gaston
to
my
union
with
his
daughter
i
discovered
to
her
my
real
name
i
proved
to
her
that
my
birth
and
expectations
justified
my
pretending
to
her
niece
and
assured
her
though
it
was
out
of
my
power
to
return
her
love
that
i
would
strive
unceasingly
to
obtain
her
esteem
and
friendship
i
stepped
into
the
carriage
where
agnes
was
already
seated
theodore
closed
the
door
and
the
postillions
drove
away
at
first
i
was
delighted
with
the
rapidity
of
our
progress
but
as
soon
as
we
were
in
no
danger
of
pursuit
i
called
to
the
drivers
and
bad
them
moderate
their
pace
they
strove
in
vain
to
obey
me
the
horses
refused
to
answer
the
rein
and
continued
to
rush
on
with
astonishing
swiftness
the
postillions
redoubled
their
efforts
to
stop
them
but
by
kicking
and
plunging
the
beasts
soon
released
themselves
from
this
restraint
uttering
a
loud
shriek
the
drivers
were
hurled
upon
the
ground
immediately
thick
clouds
obscured
the
sky
the
winds
howled
around
us
the
lightning
flashed
and
the
thunder
roared
tremendously
never
did
i
behold
so
frightful
a
tempest
terrified
by
the
jar
of
contending
elements
the
horses
seemed
every
moment
to
increase
their
speed
nothing
could
interrupt
their
career
they
dragged
the
carriage
through
hedges
and
ditches
dashed
down
the
most
dangerous
precipices
and
seemed
to
vye
in
swiftness
with
the
rapidity
of
the
winds
all
this
while
my
companion
lay
motionless
in
my
arms
truly
alarmed
by
the
magnitude
of
the
danger
i
was
in
vain
attempting
to
recall
her
to
her
senses
when
a
loud
crash
announced
that
a
stop
was
put
to
our
progress
in
the
most
disagreeable
manner
the
carriage
was
shattered
to
pieces
in
falling
i
struck
my
temple
against
a
flint
the
pain
of
the
wound
the
violence
of
the
shock
and
apprehension
for
the
safety
of
agnes
combined
to
overpower
me
so
compleatly
that
my
senses
forsook
me
and
i
lay
without
animation
on
the
ground
i
probably
remained
for
some
time
in
this
situation
since
when
i
opened
my
eyes
it
was
broad
daylight
several
peasants
were
standing
round
me
and
seemed
disputing
whether
my
recovery
was
possible
i
spoke
german
tolerably
well
as
soon
as
i
could
utter
an
articulate
sound
i
enquired
after
agnes
what
was
my
surprise
and
distress
when
assured
by
the
peasants
that
nobody
had
been
seen
answering
the
description
which
i
gave
of
her
they
told
me
that
in
going
to
their
daily
labour
they
had
been
alarmed
by
observing
the
fragments
of
my
carriage
and
by
hearing
the
groans
of
an
horse
the
only
one
of
the
four
which
remained
alive
the
other
three
lay
dead
by
my
side
nobody
was
near
me
when
they
came
up
and
much
time
had
been
lost
before
they
succeeded
in
recovering
me
uneasy
beyond
expression
respecting
the
fate
of
my
companion
i
besought
the
peasants
to
disperse
themselves
in
search
of
her
i
described
her
dress
and
promised
immense
rewards
to
whoever
brought
me
any
intelligence
as
for
myself
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
join
in
the
pursuit
i
had
broken
two
of
my
ribs
in
the
fall
my
arm
being
dislocated
hung
useless
by
my
side
and
my
left
leg
was
shattered
so
terribly
that
i
never
expected
to
recover
its
use
the
peasants
complied
with
my
request
all
left
me
except
four
who
made
a
litter
of
boughs
and
prepared
to
convey
me
to
the
neighbouring
town
i
enquired
its
name
it
proved
to
be
ratisbon
and
i
could
scarcely
persuade
myself
that
i
had
travelled
to
such
a
distance
in
a
single
night
i
told
the
countrymen
that
at
one
o'clock
that
morning
i
had
past
through
the
village
of
rosenwald
they
shook
their
heads
wistfully
and
made
signs
to
each
other
that
i
must
certainly
be
delirious
i
was
conveyed
to
a
decent
inn
and
immediately
put
to
bed
a
physician
was
sent
for
who
set
my
arm
with
success
he
then
examined
my
other
hurts
and
told
me
that
i
need
be
under
no
apprehension
of
the
consequences
of
any
of
them
but
ordered
me
to
keep
myself
quiet
and
be
prepared
for
a
tedious
and
painful
cure
i
answered
him
that
if
he
hoped
to
keep
me
quiet
he
must
first
endeavour
to
procure
me
some
news
of
a
lady
who
had
quitted
rosenwald
in
my
company
the
night
before
and
had
been
with
me
at
the
moment
when
the
coach
broke
down
he
smiled
and
only
replied
by
advising
me
to
make
myself
easy
for
that
all
proper
care
should
be
taken
of
me
as
he
quitted
me
the
hostess
met
him
at
the
door
of
the
room
'the
gentleman
is
not
quite
in
his
right
senses'
i
heard
him
say
to
her
in
a
low
voice
''tis
the
natural
consequence
of
his
fall
but
that
will
soon
be
over'
one
after
another
the
peasants
returned
to
the
inn
and
informed
me
that
no
traces
had
been
discovered
of
my
unfortunate
mistress
uneasiness
now
became
despair
i
entreated
them
to
renew
their
search
in
the
most
urgent
terms
doubling
the
promises
which
i
had
already
made
them
my
wild
and
frantic
manner
confirmed
the
bye-standers
in
the
idea
of
my
being
delirious
no
signs
of
the
lady
having
appeared
they
believed
her
to
be
a
creature
fabricated
by
my
over-heated
brain
and
paid
no
attention
to
my
entreaties
however
the
hostess
assured
me
that
a
fresh
enquiry
should
be
made
but
i
found
afterwards
that
her
promise
was
only
given
to
quiet
me
no
further
steps
were
taken
in
the
business
though
my
baggage
was
left
at
munich
under
the
care
of
my
french
servant
having
prepared
myself
for
a
long
journey
my
purse
was
amply
furnished
besides
my
equipage
proved
me
to
be
of
distinction
and
in
consequence
all
possible
attention
was
paid
me
at
the
inn
the
day
passed
away
still
no
news
arrived
of
agnes
the
anxiety
of
fear
now
gave
place
to
despondency
i
ceased
to
rave
about
her
and
was
plunged
in
the
depth
of
melancholy
reflections
perceiving
me
to
be
silent
and
tranquil
my
attendants
believed
my
delirium
to
have
abated
and
that
my
malady
had
taken
a
favourable
turn
according
to
the
physician's
order
i
swallowed
a
composing
medicine
and
as
soon
as
the
night
shut
in
my
attendants
withdrew
and
left
me
to
repose
that
repose
i
wooed
in
vain
the
agitation
of
my
bosom
chased
away
sleep
restless
in
my
mind
in
spite
of
the
fatigue
of
my
body
i
continued
to
toss
about
from
side
to
side
till
the
clock
in
a
neighbouring
steeple
struck
'one'
as
i
listened
to
the
mournful
hollow
sound
and
heard
it
die
away
in
the
wind
i
felt
a
sudden
chillness
spread
itself
over
my
body
i
shuddered
without
knowing
wherefore
cold
dews
poured
down
my
forehead
and
my
hair
stood
bristling
with
alarm
suddenly
i
heard
slow
and
heavy
steps
ascending
the
staircase
by
an
involuntary
movement
i
started
up
in
my
bed
and
drew
back
the
curtain
a
single
rush-light
which
glimmered
upon
the
hearth
shed
a
faint
gleam
through
the
apartment
which
was
hung
with
tapestry
the
door
was
thrown
open
with
violence
a
figure
entered
and
drew
near
my
bed
with
solemn
measured
steps
with
trembling
apprehension
i
examined
this
midnight
visitor
god
almighty
it
was
the
bleeding
nun
it
was
my
lost
companion
her
face
was
still
veiled
but
she
no
longer
held
her
lamp
and
dagger
she
lifted
up
her
veil
slowly
what
a
sight
presented
itself
to
my
startled
eyes
i
beheld
before
me
an
animated
corse
her
countenance
was
long
and
haggard
her
cheeks
and
lips
were
bloodless
the
paleness
of
death
was
spread
over
her
features
and
her
eyeballs
fixed
stedfastly
upon
me
were
lustreless
and
hollow
i
gazed
upon
the
spectre
with
horror
too
great
to
be
described
my
blood
was
frozen
in
my
veins
i
would
have
called
for
aid
but
the
sound
expired
ere
it
could
pass
my
lips
my
nerves
were
bound
up
in
impotence
and
i
remained
in
the
same
attitude
inanimate
as
a
statue
the
visionary
nun
looked
upon
me
for
some
minutes
in
silence
there
was
something
petrifying
in
her
regard
at
length
in
a
low
sepulchral
voice
she
pronounced
the
following
words
raymond
raymond
thou
art
mine
raymond
raymond
i
am
thine
in
thy
veins
while
blood
shall
roll
i
am
thine
thou
art
mine
mine
thy
body
mine
thy
soul----
breathless
with
fear
i
listened
while
she
repeated
my
own
expressions
the
apparition
seated
herself
opposite
to
me
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
was
silent
her
eyes
were
fixed
earnestly
upon
mine
they
seemed
endowed
with
the
property
of
the
rattlesnake's
for
i
strove
in
vain
to
look
off
her
my
eyes
were
fascinated
and
i
had
not
the
power
of
withdrawing
them
from
the
spectre's
in
this
attitude
she
remained
for
a
whole
long
hour
without
speaking
or
moving
nor
was
i
able
to
do
either
at
length
the
clock
struck
two
the
apparition
rose
from
her
seat
and
approached
the
side
of
the
bed
she
grasped
with
her
icy
fingers
my
hand
which
hung
lifeless
upon
the
coverture
and
pressing
her
cold
lips
to
mine
again
repeated
raymond
raymond
thou
art
mine
raymond
raymond
i
am
thine
c----
she
then
dropped
my
hand
quitted
the
chamber
with
slow
steps
and
the
door
closed
after
her
till
that
moment
the
faculties
of
my
body
had
been
all
suspended
those
of
my
mind
had
alone
been
waking
the
charm
now
ceased
to
operate
the
blood
which
had
been
frozen
in
my
veins
rushed
back
to
my
heart
with
violence
i
uttered
a
deep
groan
and
sank
lifeless
upon
my
pillow
the
adjoining
room
was
only
separated
from
mine
by
a
thin
partition
it
was
occupied
by
the
host
and
his
wife
the
former
was
rouzed
by
my
groan
and
immediately
hastened
to
my
chamber
the
hostess
soon
followed
him
with
some
difficulty
they
succeeded
in
restoring
me
to
my
senses
and
immediately
sent
for
the
physician
who
arrived
in
all
diligence
he
declared
my
fever
to
be
very
much
increased
and
that
if
i
continued
to
suffer
such
violent
agitation
he
would
not
take
upon
him
to
ensure
my
life
some
medicines
which
he
gave
me
in
some
degree
tranquillized
my
spirits
i
fell
into
a
sort
of
slumber
towards
daybreak
but
fearful
dreams
prevented
me
from
deriving
any
benefit
from
my
repose
agnes
and
the
bleeding
nun
presented
themselves
by
turns
to
my
fancy
and
combined
to
harass
and
torment
me
i
awoke
fatigued
and
unrefreshed
my
fever
seemed
rather
augmented
than
diminished
the
agitation
of
my
mind
impeded
my
fractured
bones
from
knitting
i
had
frequent
fainting
fits
and
during
the
whole
day
the
physician
judged
it
expedient
not
to
quit
me
for
two
hours
together
the
singularity
of
my
adventure
made
me
determine
to
conceal
it
from
every
one
since
i
could
not
expect
that
a
circumstance
so
strange
should
gain
credit
i
was
very
uneasy
about
agnes
i
knew
not
what
she
would
think
at
not
finding
me
at
the
rendezvous
and
dreaded
her
entertaining
suspicions
of
my
fidelity
however
i
depended
upon
theodore's
discretion
and
trusted
that
my
letter
to
the
baroness
would
convince
her
of
the
rectitude
of
my
intentions
these
considerations
somewhat
lightened
my
inquietude
upon
her
account
but
the
impression
left
upon
my
mind
by
my
nocturnal
visitor
grew
stronger
with
every
succeeding
moment
the
night
drew
near
i
dreaded
its
arrival
yet
i
strove
to
persuade
myself
that
the
ghost
would
appear
no
more
and
at
all
events
i
desired
that
a
servant
might
sit
up
in
my
chamber
the
fatigue
of
my
body
from
not
having
slept
on
the
former
night
co-operating
with
the
strong
opiates
administered
to
me
in
profusion
at
length
procured
me
that
repose
of
which
i
was
so
much
in
need
i
sank
into
a
profound
and
tranquil
slumber
and
had
already
slept
for
some
hours
when
the
neighbouring
clock
rouzed
me
by
striking
'one'
its
sound
brought
with
it
to
my
memory
all
the
horrors
of
the
night
before
the
same
cold
shivering
seized
me
i
started
up
in
my
bed
and
perceived
the
servant
fast
asleep
in
an
armed-chair
near
me
i
called
him
by
his
name
he
made
no
answer
i
shook
him
forcibly
by
the
arm
and
strove
in
vain
to
wake
him
he
was
perfectly
insensible
to
my
efforts
i
now
heard
the
heavy
steps
ascending
the
staircase
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
again
the
bleeding
nun
stood
before
me
once
more
my
limbs
were
chained
in
second
infancy
once
more
i
heard
those
fatal
words
repeated
raymond
raymond
thou
art
mine
raymond
raymond
i
am
thine
c----
the
scene
which
had
shocked
me
so
sensibly
on
the
former
night
was
again
presented
the
spectre
again
pressed
her
lips
to
mine
again
touched
me
with
her
rotting
fingers
and
as
on
her
first
appearance
quitted
the
chamber
as
soon
as
the
clock
told
'two'
even
night
was
this
repeated
far
from
growing
accustomed
to
the
ghost
every
succeeding
visit
inspired
me
with
greater
horror
her
idea
pursued
me
continually
and
i
became
the
prey
of
habitual
melancholy
the
constant
agitation
of
my
mind
naturally
retarded
the
re-establishment
of
my
health
several
months
elapsed
before
i
was
able
to
quit
my
bed
and
when
at
length
i
was
moved
to
a
sopha
i
was
so
faint
spiritless
and
emaciated
that
i
could
not
cross
the
room
without
assistance
the
looks
of
my
attendants
sufficiently
denoted
the
little
hope
which
they
entertained
of
my
recovery
the
profound
sadness
which
oppressed
me
without
remission
made
the
physician
consider
me
to
be
an
hypochondriac
the
cause
of
my
distress
i
carefully
concealed
in
my
own
bosom
for
i
knew
that
no
one
could
give
me
relief
the
ghost
was
not
even
visible
to
any
eye
but
mine
i
had
frequently
caused
attendants
to
sit
up
in
my
room
but
the
moment
that
the
clock
struck
'one'
irresistible
slumber
seized
them
nor
left
them
till
the
departure
of
the
ghost
you
may
be
surprized
that
during
this
time
i
made
no
enquiries
after
your
sister
theodore
who
with
difficulty
had
discovered
my
abode
had
quieted
my
apprehensions
for
her
safety
at
the
same
time
he
convinced
me
that
all
attempts
to
release
her
from
captivity
must
be
fruitless
till
i
should
be
in
a
condition
to
return
to
spain
the
particulars
of
her
adventure
which
i
shall
now
relate
to
you
were
partly
communicated
to
me
by
theodore
and
partly
by
agnes
herself
on
the
fatal
night
when
her
elopement
was
to
have
taken
place
accident
had
not
permitted
her
to
quit
her
chamber
at
the
appointed
time
at
length
she
ventured
into
the
haunted
room
descended
the
staircase
leading
into
the
hall
found
the
gates
open
as
she
expected
and
left
the
castle
unobserved
what
was
her
surprize
at
not
finding
me
ready
to
receive
her
she
examined
the
cavern
ranged
through
every
alley
of
the
neighbouring
wood
and
passed
two
full
hours
in
this
fruitless
enquiry
she
could
discover
no
traces
either
of
me
or
of
the
carriage
alarmed
and
disappointed
her
only
resource
was
to
return
to
the
castle
before
the
baroness
missed
her
but
here
she
found
herself
in
a
fresh
embarrassment
the
bell
had
already
tolled
'two'
the
ghostly
hour
was
past
and
the
careful
porter
had
locked
the
folding
gates
after
much
irresolution
she
ventured
to
knock
softly
luckily
for
her
conrad
was
still
awake
he
heard
the
noise
and
rose
murmuring
at
being
called
up
a
second
time
no
sooner
had
he
opened
one
of
the
doors
and
beheld
the
supposed
apparition
waiting
there
for
admittance
than
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
sank
upon
his
knees
agnes
profited
by
his
terror
she
glided
by
him
flew
to
her
own
apartment
and
having
thrown
off
her
spectre's
trappings
retired
to
bed
endeavouring
in
vain
to
account
for
my
disappearing
in
the
mean
while
theodore
having
seen
my
carriage
drive
off
with
the
false
agnes
returned
joyfully
to
the
village
the
next
morning
he
released
cunegonda
from
her
confinement
and
accompanied
her
to
the
castle
there
he
found
the
baron
his
lady
and
don
gaston
disputing
together
upon
the
porter's
relation
all
of
them
agreed
in
believing
the
existence
of
spectres
but
the
latter
contended
that
for
a
ghost
to
knock
for
admittance
was
a
proceeding
till
then
unwitnessed
and
totally
incompatible
with
the
immaterial
nature
of
a
spirit
they
were
still
discussing
this
subject
when
the
page
appeared
with
cunegonda
and
cleared
up
the
mystery
on
hearing
his
deposition
it
was
agreed
unanimously
that
the
agnes
whom
theodore
had
seen
step
into
my
carriage
must
have
been
the
bleeding
nun
and
that
the
ghost
who
had
terrified
conrad
was
no
other
than
don
gaston's
daughter
the
first
surprize
which
this
discovery
occasioned
being
over
the
baroness
resolved
to
make
it
of
use
in
persuading
her
niece
to
take
the
veil
fearing
lest
so
advantageous
an
establishment
for
his
daughter
should
induce
don
gaston
to
renounce
his
resolution
she
suppressed
my
letter
and
continued
to
represent
me
as
a
needy
unknown
adventurer
a
childish
vanity
had
led
me
to
conceal
my
real
name
even
from
my
mistress
i
wished
to
be
loved
for
myself
not
for
being
the
son
and
heir
of
the
marquis
de
las
cisternas
the
consequence
was
that
my
rank
was
known
to
no
one
in
the
castle
except
the
baroness
and
she
took
good
care
to
confine
the
knowledge
to
her
own
breast
don
gaston
having
approved
his
sister's
design
agnes
was
summoned
to
appear
before
them
she
was
taxed
with
having
meditated
an
elopement
obliged
to
make
a
full
confession
and
was
amazed
at
the
gentleness
with
which
it
was
received
but
what
was
her
affliction
when
informed
that
the
failure
of
her
project
must
be
attributed
to
me
cunegonda
tutored
by
the
baroness
told
her
that
when
i
released
her
i
had
desired
her
to
inform
her
lady
that
our
connexion
was
at
an
end
that
the
whole
affair
was
occasioned
by
a
false
report
and
that
it
by
no
means
suited
my
circumstances
to
marry
a
woman
without
fortune
or
expectations
to
this
account
my
sudden
disappearing
gave
but
too
great
an
air
of
probability
theodore
who
could
have
contradicted
the
story
by
donna
rodolpha's
order
was
kept
out
of
her
sight
what
proved
a
still
greater
confirmation
of
my
being
an
impostor
was
the
arrival
of
a
letter
from
yourself
declaring
that
you
had
no
sort
of
acquaintance
with
alphonso
d'alvarada
these
seeming
proofs
of
my
perfidy
aided
by
the
artful
insinuations
of
her
aunt
by
cunegonda's
flattery
and
her
father's
threats
and
anger
entirely
conquered
your
sister's
repugnance
to
a
convent
incensed
at
my
behaviour
and
disgusted
with
the
world
in
general
she
consented
to
receive
the
veil
she
past
another
month
at
the
castle
of
lindenberg
during
which
my
non-appearance
confirmed
her
in
her
resolution
and
then
accompanied
don
gaston
into
spain
theodore
was
now
set
at
liberty
he
hastened
to
munich
where
i
had
promised
to
let
him
hear
from
me
but
finding
from
lucas
that
i
had
never
arrived
there
he
pursued
his
search
with
indefatigable
perseverance
and
at
length
succeeded
in
rejoining
me
at
ratisbon
so
much
was
i
altered
that
scarcely
could
he
recollect
my
features
the
distress
visible
upon
his
sufficiently
testified
how
lively
was
the
interest
which
he
felt
for
me
the
society
of
this
amiable
boy
whom
i
had
always
considered
rather
as
a
companion
than
a
servant
was
now
my
only
comfort
his
conversation
was
gay
yet
sensible
and
his
observations
shrewd
and
entertaining
he
had
picked
up
much
more
knowledge
than
is
usual
at
his
age
but
what
rendered
him
most
agreeable
to
me
was
his
having
a
delightful
voice
and
some
skill
in
music
he
had
also
acquired
some
taste
in
poetry
and
even
ventured
sometimes
to
write
verses
himself
he
occasionally
composed
little
ballads
in
spanish
his
compositions
were
but
indifferent
i
must
confess
yet
they
were
pleasing
to
me
from
their
novelty
and
hearing
him
sing
them
to
his
guitar
was
the
only
amusement
which
i
was
capable
of
receiving
theodore
perceived
well
enough
that
something
preyed
upon
my
mind
but
as
i
concealed
the
cause
of
my
grief
even
from
him
respect
would
not
permit
him
to
pry
into
my
secrets
one
evening
i
was
lying
upon
my
sopha
plunged
in
reflections
very
far
from
agreeable
theodore
amused
himself
by
observing
from
the
window
a
battle
between
two
postillions
who
were
quarrelling
in
the
inn-yard
'ha
ha'
cried
he
suddenly
'yonder
is
the
great
mogul'
'who'
said
i
'only
a
man
who
made
me
a
strange
speech
at
munich'
'what
was
the
purport
of
it'
'now
you
put
me
in
mind
of
it
segnor
it
was
a
kind
of
message
to
you
but
truly
it
was
not
worth
delivering
i
believe
the
fellow
to
be
mad
for
my
part
when
i
came
to
munich
in
search
of
you
i
found
him
living
at
'the
king
of
the
romans'
and
the
host
gave
me
an
odd
account
of
him
by
his
accent
he
is
supposed
to
be
a
foreigner
but
of
what
country
nobody
can
tell
he
seemed
to
have
no
acquaintance
in
the
town
spoke
very
seldom
and
never
was
seen
to
smile
he
had
neither
servants
or
baggage
but
his
purse
seemed
well-furnished
and
he
did
much
good
in
the
town
some
supposed
him
to
be
an
arabian
astrologer
others
to
be
a
travelling
mountebank
and
many
declared
that
he
was
doctor
faustus
whom
the
devil
had
sent
back
to
germany
the
landlord
however
told
me
that
he
had
the
best
reasons
to
believe
him
to
be
the
great
mogul
incognito'
'but
the
strange
speech
theodore'
'true
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
speech
indeed
for
that
matter
it
would
not
have
been
a
great
loss
if
i
had
forgotten
it
altogether
you
are
to
know
segnor
that
while
i
was
enquiring
about
you
of
the
landlord
this
stranger
passed
by
he
stopped
and
looked
at
me
earnestly
'youth'
said
he
in
a
solemn
voice
'he
whom
you
seek
has
found
that
which
he
would
fain
lose
my
hand
alone
can
dry
up
the
blood
bid
your
master
wish
for
me
when
the
clock
strikes
'one'
'how'
cried
i
starting
from
my
sopha
the
words
which
theodore
had
repeated
seemed
to
imply
the
stranger's
knowledge
of
my
secret
'fly
to
him
my
boy
entreat
him
to
grant
me
one
moment's
conversation'
theodore
was
surprised
at
the
vivacity
of
my
manner
however
he
asked
no
questions
but
hastened
to
obey
me
i
waited
his
return
impatiently
but
a
short
space
of
time
had
elapsed
when
he
again
appeared
and
ushered
the
expected
guest
into
my
chamber
he
was
a
man
of
majestic
presence
his
countenance
was
strongly
marked
and
his
eyes
were
large
black
and
sparkling
yet
there
was
a
something
in
his
look
which
the
moment
that
i
saw
him
inspired
me
with
a
secret
awe
not
to
say
horror
he
was
drest
plainly
his
hair
was
unpowdered
and
a
band
of
black
velvet
which
encircled
his
forehead
spread
over
his
features
an
additional
gloom
his
countenance
wore
the
marks
of
profound
melancholy
his
step
was
slow
and
his
manner
grave
stately
and
solemn
he
saluted
me
with
politeness
and
having
replied
to
the
usual
compliments
of
introduction
he
motioned
to
theodore
to
quit
the
chamber
the
page
instantly
withdrew
'i
know
your
business'
said
he
without
giving
me
time
to
speak
'i
have
the
power
of
releasing
you
from
your
nightly
visitor
but
this
cannot
be
done
before
sunday
on
the
hour
when
the
sabbath
morning
breaks
spirits
of
darkness
have
least
influence
over
mortals
after
saturday
the
nun
shall
visit
you
no
more'
'may
i
not
enquire'
said
i
'by
what
means
you
are
in
possession
of
a
secret
which
i
have
carefully
concealed
from
the
knowledge
of
everyone'
'how
can
i
be
ignorant
of
your
distress
when
their
cause
at
this
moment
stands
beside
you'
i
started
the
stranger
continued
'though
to
you
only
visible
for
one
hour
in
the
twenty-four
neither
day
or
night
does
she
ever
quit
you
nor
will
she
ever
quit
you
till
you
have
granted
her
request'
'and
what
is
that
request'
'that
she
must
herself
explain
it
lies
not
in
my
knowledge
wait
with
patience
for
the
night
of
saturday
all
shall
be
then
cleared
up'
i
dared
not
press
him
further
he
soon
after
changed
the
conversation
and
talked
of
various
matters
he
named
people
who
had
ceased
to
exist
for
many
centuries
and
yet
with
whom
he
appeared
to
have
been
personally
acquainted
i
could
not
mention
a
country
however
distant
which
he
had
not
visited
nor
could
i
sufficiently
admire
the
extent
and
variety
of
his
information
i
remarked
to
him
that
having
travelled
seen
and
known
so
much
must
have
given
him
infinite
pleasure
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
'no
one'
he
replied
'is
adequate
to
comprehending
the
misery
of
my
lot
fate
obliges
me
to
be
constantly
in
movement
i
am
not
permitted
to
pass
more
than
a
fortnight
in
the
same
place
i
have
no
friend
in
the
world
and
from
the
restlessness
of
my
destiny
i
never
can
acquire
one
fain
would
i
lay
down
my
miserable
life
for
i
envy
those
who
enjoy
the
quiet
of
the
grave
but
death
eludes
me
and
flies
from
my
embrace
in
vain
do
i
throw
myself
in
the
way
of
danger
i
plunge
into
the
ocean
the
waves
throw
me
back
with
abhorrence
upon
the
shore
i
rush
into
fire
the
flames
recoil
at
my
approach
i
oppose
myself
to
the
fury
of
banditti
their
swords
become
blunted
and
break
against
my
breast
the
hungry
tiger
shudders
at
my
approach
and
the
alligator
flies
from
a
monster
more
horrible
than
itself
god
has
set
his
seal
upon
me
and
all
his
creatures
respect
this
fatal
mark'
he
put
his
hand
to
the
velvet
which
was
bound
round
his
forehead
there
was
in
his
eyes
an
expression
of
fury
despair
and
malevolence
that
struck
horror
to
my
very
soul
an
involuntary
convulsion
made
me
shudder
the
stranger
perceived
it
'such
is
the
curse
imposed
on
me'
he
continued
'i
am
doomed
to
inspire
all
who
look
on
me
with
terror
and
detestation
you
already
feel
the
influence
of
the
charm
and
with
every
succeeding
moment
will
feel
it
more
i
will
not
add
to
your
sufferings
by
my
presence
farewell
till
saturday
as
soon
as
the
clock
strikes
twelve
expect
me
at
your
chamber
door'
having
said
this
he
departed
leaving
me
in
astonishment
at
the
mysterious
turn
of
his
manner
and
conversation
his
assurances
that
i
should
soon
be
relieved
from
the
apparition's
visits
produced
a
good
effect
upon
my
constitution
theodore
whom
i
rather
treated
as
an
adopted
child
than
a
domestic
was
surprized
at
his
return
to
observe
the
amendment
in
my
looks
he
congratulated
me
on
this
symptom
of
returning
health
and
declared
himself
delighted
at
my
having
received
so
much
benefit
from
my
conference
with
the
great
mogul
upon
enquiry
i
found
that
the
stranger
had
already
past
eight
days
in
ratisbon
according
to
his
own
account
therefore
he
was
only
to
remain
there
six
days
longer
saturday
was
still
at
the
distance
of
three
oh
with
what
impatience
did
i
expect
its
arrival
in
the
interim
the
bleeding
nun
continued
her
nocturnal
visits
but
hoping
soon
to
be
released
from
them
altogether
the
effects
which
they
produced
on
me
became
less
violent
than
before
the
wished-for
night
arrived
to
avoid
creating
suspicion
i
retired
to
bed
at
my
usual
hour
but
as
soon
as
my
attendants
had
left
me
i
dressed
myself
again
and
prepared
for
the
stranger's
reception
he
entered
my
room
upon
the
turn
of
midnight
a
small
chest
was
in
his
hand
which
he
placed
near
the
stove
he
saluted
me
without
speaking
i
returned
the
compliment
observing
an
equal
silence
he
then
opened
his
chest
the
first
thing
which
he
produced
was
a
small
wooden
crucifix
he
sank
upon
his
knees
gazed
upon
it
mournfully
and
cast
his
eyes
towards
heaven
he
seemed
to
be
praying
devoutly
at
length
he
bowed
his
head
respectfully
kissed
the
crucifix
thrice
and
quitted
his
kneeling
posture
he
next
drew
from
the
chest
a
covered
goblet
with
the
liquor
which
it
contained
and
which
appeared
to
be
blood
he
sprinkled
the
floor
and
then
dipping
in
it
one
end
of
the
crucifix
he
described
a
circle
in
the
middle
of
the
room
round
about
this
he
placed
various
reliques
sculls
thigh-bones
c
i
observed
that
he
disposed
them
all
in
the
forms
of
crosses
lastly
he
took
out
a
large
bible
and
beckoned
me
to
follow
him
into
the
circle
i
obeyed
'be
cautious
not
to
utter
a
syllable'
whispered
the
stranger
'step
not
out
of
the
circle
and
as
you
love
yourself
dare
not
to
look
upon
my
face'
holding
the
crucifix
in
one
hand
the
bible
in
the
other
he
seemed
to
read
with
profound
attention
the
clock
struck
'one'
as
usual
i
heard
the
spectre's
steps
upon
the
staircase
but
i
was
not
seized
with
the
accustomed
shivering
i
waited
her
approach
with
confidence
she
entered
the
room
drew
near
the
circle
and
stopped
the
stranger
muttered
some
words
to
me
unintelligible
then
raising
his
head
from
the
book
and
extending
the
crucifix
towards
the
ghost
he
pronounced
in
a
voice
distinct
and
solemn
'beatrice
beatrice
beatrice'
'what
wouldst
thou'
replied
the
apparition
in
a
hollow
faltering
tone
'what
disturbs
thy
sleep
why
dost
thou
afflict
and
torture
this
youth
how
can
rest
be
restored
to
thy
unquiet
spirit'
'i
dare
not
tell--i
must
not
tell--fain
would
i
repose
in
my
grave
but
stern
commands
force
me
to
prolong
my
punishment'
'knowest
thou
this
blood
knowest
thou
in
whose
veins
it
flowed
beatrice
beatrice
in
his
name
i
charge
thee
to
answer
me'
'i
dare
not
disobey
my
taskers'
'darest
thou
disobey
me'
he
spoke
in
a
commanding
tone
and
drew
the
sable
band
from
his
forehead
in
spite
of
his
injunctions
to
the
contrary
curiosity
would
not
suffer
me
to
keep
my
eyes
off
his
face
i
raised
them
and
beheld
a
burning
cross
impressed
upon
his
brow
for
the
horror
with
which
this
object
inspired
me
i
cannot
account
but
i
never
felt
its
equal
my
senses
left
me
for
some
moments
a
mysterious
dread
overcame
my
courage
and
had
not
the
exorciser
caught
my
hand
i
should
have
fallen
out
of
the
circle
when
i
recovered
myself
i
perceived
that
the
burning
cross
had
produced
an
effect
no
less
violent
upon
the
spectre
her
countenance
expressed
reverence
and
horror
and
her
visionary
limbs
were
shaken
by
fear
'yes'
she
said
at
length
'i
tremble
at
that
mark--respect
it--i
obey
you
know
then
that
my
bones
lie
still
unburied
they
rot
in
the
obscurity
of
lindenberg
hole
none
but
this
youth
has
the
right
of
consigning
them
to
the
grave
his
own
lips
have
made
over
to
me
his
body
and
his
soul
never
will
i
give
back
his
promise
never
shall
he
know
a
night
devoid
of
terror
unless
he
engages
to
collect
my
mouldering
bones
and
deposit
them
in
the
family
vault
of
his
andalusian
castle
then
let
thirty
masses
be
said
for
the
repose
of
my
spirit
and
i
trouble
this
world
no
more
now
let
me
depart
those
flames
are
scorching'
he
let
the
hand
drop
slowly
which
held
the
crucifix
and
which
till
then
he
had
pointed
towards
her
the
apparition
bowed
her
head
and
her
form
melted
into
air
the
exorciser
led
me
out
of
the
circle
he
replaced
the
bible
c
in
the
chest
and
then
addressed
himself
to
me
who
stood
near
him
speechless
from
astonishment
'don
raymond
you
have
heard
the
conditions
on
which
repose
is
promised
you
be
it
your
business
to
fulfil
them
to
the
letter
for
me
nothing
more
remains
than
to
clear
up
the
darkness
still
spread
over
the
spectre's
history
and
inform
you
that
when
living
beatrice
bore
the
name
of
las
cisternas
she
was
the
great
aunt
of
your
grandfather
in
quality
of
your
relation
her
ashes
demand
respect
from
you
though
the
enormity
of
her
crimes
must
excite
your
abhorrence
the
nature
of
those
crimes
no
one
is
more
capable
of
explaining
to
you
than
myself
i
was
personally
acquainted
with
the
holy
man
who
proscribed
her
nocturnal
riots
in
the
castle
of
lindenberg
and
i
hold
this
narrative
from
his
own
lips
'beatrice
de
las
cisternas
took
the
veil
at
an
early
age
not
by
her
own
choice
but
at
the
express
command
of
her
parents
she
was
then
too
young
to
regret
the
pleasures
of
which
her
profession
deprived
her
but
no
sooner
did
her
warm
and
voluptuous
character
begin
to
be
developed
than
she
abandoned
herself
freely
to
the
impulse
of
her
passions
and
seized
the
first
opportunity
to
procure
their
gratification
this
opportunity
was
at
length
presented
after
many
obstacles
which
only
added
new
force
to
her
desires
she
contrived
to
elope
from
the
convent
and
fled
to
germany
with
the
baron
lindenberg
she
lived
at
his
castle
several
months
as
his
avowed
concubine
all
bavaria
was
scandalized
by
her
impudent
and
abandoned
conduct
her
feasts
vied
in
luxury
with
cleopatra's
and
lindenberg
became
the
theatre
of
the
most
unbridled
debauchery
not
satisfied
with
displaying
the
incontinence
of
a
prostitute
she
professed
herself
an
atheist
she
took
every
opportunity
to
scoff
at
her
monastic
vows
and
loaded
with
ridicule
the
most
sacred
ceremonies
of
religion
'possessed
of
a
character
so
depraved
she
did
not
long
confine
her
affections
to
one
object
soon
after
her
arrival
at
the
castle
the
baron's
younger
brother
attracted
her
notice
by
his
strong-marked
features
gigantic
stature
and
herculean
limbs
she
was
not
of
an
humour
to
keep
her
inclinations
long
unknown
but
she
found
in
otto
von
lindenberg
her
equal
in
depravity
he
returned
her
passion
just
sufficiently
to
increase
it
and
when
he
had
worked
it
up
to
the
desired
pitch
he
fixed
the
price
of
his
love
at
his
brother's
murder
the
wretch
consented
to
this
horrible
agreement
a
night
was
pitched
upon
for
perpetrating
the
deed
otto
who
resided
on
a
small
estate
a
few
miles
distant
from
the
castle
promised
that
at
one
in
the
morning
he
would
be
waiting
for
her
at
lindenberg
hole
that
he
would
bring
with
him
a
party
of
chosen
friends
by
whose
aid
he
doubted
not
being
able
to
make
himself
master
of
the
castle
and
that
his
next
step
should
be
the
uniting
her
hand
to
his
it
was
this
last
promise
which
overruled
every
scruple
of
beatrice
since
in
spite
of
his
affection
for
her
the
baron
had
declared
positively
that
he
never
would
make
her
his
wife
'the
fatal
night
arrived
the
baron
slept
in
the
arms
of
his
perfidious
mistress
when
the
castle-bell
struck
'one'
immediately
beatrice
drew
a
dagger
from
underneath
the
pillow
and
plunged
it
in
her
paramour's
heart
the
baron
uttered
a
single
dreadful
groan
and
expired
the
murderess
quitted
her
bed
hastily
took
a
lamp
in
one
hand
in
the
other
the
bloody
dagger
and
bent
her
course
towards
the
cavern
the
porter
dared
not
to
refuse
opening
the
gates
to
one
more
dreaded
in
the
castle
than
its
master
beatrice
reached
lindenberg
hole
unopposed
where
according
to
promise
she
found
otto
waiting
for
her
he
received
and
listened
to
her
narrative
with
transport
but
ere
she
had
time
to
ask
why
he
came
unaccompanied
he
convinced
her
that
he
wished
for
no
witnesses
to
their
interview
anxious
to
conceal
his
share
in
the
murder
and
to
free
himself
from
a
woman
whose
violent
and
atrocious
character
made
him
tremble
with
reason
for
his
own
safety
he
had
resolved
on
the
destruction
of
his
wretched
agent
rushing
upon
her
suddenly
he
wrested
the
dagger
from
her
hand
he
plunged
it
still
reeking
with
his
brother's
blood
in
her
bosom
and
put
an
end
to
her
existence
by
repeated
blows
'otto
now
succeeded
to
the
barony
of
lindenberg
the
murder
was
attributed
solely
to
the
fugitive
nun
and
no
one
suspected
him
to
have
persuaded
her
to
the
action
but
though
his
crime
was
unpunished
by
man
god's
justice
permitted
him
not
to
enjoy
in
peace
his
blood-stained
honours
her
bones
lying
still
unburied
in
the
cave
the
restless
soul
of
beatrice
continued
to
inhabit
the
castle
drest
in
her
religious
habit
in
memory
of
her
vows
broken
to
heaven
furnished
with
the
dagger
which
had
drank
the
blood
of
her
paramour
and
holding
the
lamp
which
had
guided
her
flying
steps
every
night
did
she
stand
before
the
bed
of
otto
the
most
dreadful
confusion
reigned
through
the
castle
the
vaulted
chambers
resounded
with
shrieks
and
groans
and
the
spectre
as
she
ranged
along
the
antique
galleries
uttered
an
incoherent
mixture
of
prayers
and
blasphemies
otto
was
unable
to
withstand
the
shock
which
he
felt
at
this
fearful
vision
its
horror
increased
with
every
succeeding
appearance
his
alarm
at
length
became
so
insupportable
that
his
heart
burst
and
one
morning
he
was
found
in
his
bed
totally
deprived
of
warmth
and
animation
his
death
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
nocturnal
riots
the
bones
of
beatrice
continued
to
lie
unburied
and
her
ghost
continued
to
haunt
the
castle
'the
domains
of
lindenberg
now
fell
to
a
distant
relation
but
terrified
by
the
accounts
given
him
of
the
bleeding
nun
so
was
the
spectre
called
by
the
multitude
the
new
baron
called
to
his
assistance
a
celebrated
exorciser
this
holy
man
succeeded
in
obliging
her
to
temporary
repose
but
though
she
discovered
to
him
her
history
he
was
not
permitted
to
reveal
it
to
others
or
cause
her
skeleton
to
be
removed
to
hallowed
ground
that
office
was
reserved
for
you
and
till
your
coming
her
ghost
was
doomed
to
wander
about
the
castle
and
lament
the
crime
which
she
had
there
committed
however
the
exorciser
obliged
her
to
silence
during
his
lifetime
so
long
as
he
existed
the
haunted
chamber
was
shut
up
and
the
spectre
was
invisible
at
his
death
which
happened
in
five
years
after
she
again
appeared
but
only
once
on
every
fifth
year
on
the
same
day
and
at
the
same
hour
when
she
plunged
her
knife
in
the
heart
of
her
sleeping
lover
she
then
visited
the
cavern
which
held
her
mouldering
skeleton
returned
to
the
castle
as
soon
as
the
clock
struck
'two'
and
was
seen
no
more
till
the
next
five
years
had
elapsed
'she
was
doomed
to
suffer
during
the
space
of
a
century
that
period
is
past
nothing
now
remains
but
to
consign
to
the
grave
the
ashes
of
beatrice
i
have
been
the
means
of
releasing
you
from
your
visionary
tormentor
and
amidst
all
the
sorrows
which
oppress
me
to
think
that
i
have
been
of
use
to
you
is
some
consolation
youth
farewell
may
the
ghost
of
your
relation
enjoy
that
rest
in
the
tomb
which
the
almighty's
vengeance
has
denied
to
me
for
ever'
here
the
stranger
prepared
to
quit
the
apartment
'stay
yet
one
moment'
said
i
'you
have
satisfied
my
curiosity
with
regard
to
the
spectre
but
you
leave
me
in
prey
to
yet
greater
respecting
yourself
deign
to
inform
me
to
whom
i
am
under
such
real
obligations
you
mention
circumstances
long
past
and
persons
long
dead
you
were
personally
acquainted
with
the
exorciser
who
by
your
own
account
has
been
deceased
near
a
century
how
am
i
to
account
for
this
what
means
that
burning
cross
upon
your
forehead
and
why
did
the
sight
of
it
strike
such
horror
to
my
soul'
on
these
points
he
for
some
time
refused
to
satisfy
me
at
length
overcome
by
my
entreaties
he
consented
to
clear
up
the
whole
on
condition
that
i
would
defer
his
explanation
till
the
next
day
with
this
request
i
was
obliged
to
comply
and
he
left
me
in
the
morning
my
first
care
was
to
enquire
after
the
mysterious
stranger
conceive
my
disappointment
when
informed
that
he
had
already
quitted
ratisbon
i
dispatched
messengers
in
pursuit
of
him
but
in
vain
no
traces
of
the
fugitive
were
discovered
since
that
moment
i
never
have
heard
any
more
of
him
and
'tis
most
probable
that
i
never
shall'
lorenzo
here
interrupted
his
friend's
narrative
'how'
said
he
'you
have
never
discovered
who
he
was
or
even
formed
a
guess'
'pardon
me'
replied
the
marquis
'when
i
related
this
adventure
to
my
uncle
the
cardinal-duke
he
told
me
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
this
singular
man's
being
the
celebrated
character
known
universally
by
the
name
of
'the
wandering
jew'
his
not
being
permitted
to
pass
more
than
fourteen
days
on
the
same
spot
the
burning
cross
impressed
upon
his
forehead
the
effect
which
it
produced
upon
the
beholders
and
many
other
circumstances
give
this
supposition
the
colour
of
truth
the
cardinal
is
fully
persuaded
of
it
and
for
my
own
part
i
am
inclined
to
adopt
the
only
solution
which
offers
itself
to
this
riddle
i
return
to
the
narrative
from
which
i
have
digressed'
from
this
period
i
recovered
my
health
so
rapidly
as
to
astonish
my
physicians
the
bleeding
nun
appeared
no
more
and
i
was
soon
able
to
set
out
for
lindenberg
the
baron
received
me
with
open
arms
i
confided
to
him
the
sequel
of
my
adventure
and
he
was
not
a
little
pleased
to
find
that
his
mansion
would
be
no
longer
troubled
with
the
phantom's
quiennial
visits
i
was
sorry
to
perceive
that
absence
had
not
weakened
donna
rodolpha's
imprudent
passion
in
a
private
conversation
which
i
had
with
her
during
my
short
stay
at
the
castle
she
renewed
her
attempts
to
persuade
me
to
return
her
affection
regarding
her
as
the
primary
cause
of
all
my
sufferings
i
entertained
for
her
no
other
sentiment
than
disgust
the
skeleton
of
beatrice
was
found
in
the
place
which
she
had
mentioned
this
being
all
that
i
sought
at
lindenberg
i
hastened
to
quit
the
baron's
domains
equally
anxious
to
perform
the
obsequies
of
the
murdered
nun
and
escape
the
importunity
of
a
woman
whom
i
detested
i
departed
followed
by
donna
rodolpha's
menaces
that
my
contempt
should
not
be
long
unpunished
i
now
bent
my
course
towards
spain
with
all
diligence
lucas
with
my
baggage
had
joined
me
during
my
abode
at
lindenberg
i
arrived
in
my
native
country
without
any
accident
and
immediately
proceeded
to
my
father's
castle
in
andalusia
the
remains
of
beatrice
were
deposited
in
the
family
vault
all
due
ceremonies
performed
and
the
number
of
masses
said
which
she
had
required
nothing
now
hindered
me
from
employing
all
my
endeavours
to
discover
the
retreat
of
agnes
the
baroness
had
assured
me
that
her
niece
had
already
taken
the
veil
this
intelligence
i
suspected
to
have
been
forged
by
jealousy
and
hoped
to
find
my
mistress
still
at
liberty
to
accept
my
hand
i
enquired
after
her
family
i
found
that
before
her
daughter
could
reach
madrid
donna
inesilla
was
no
more
you
my
dear
lorenzo
were
said
to
be
abroad
but
where
i
could
not
discover
your
father
was
in
a
distant
province
on
a
visit
to
the
duke
de
medina
and
as
to
agnes
no
one
could
or
would
inform
me
what
was
become
of
her
theodore
according
to
promise
had
returned
to
strasbourg
where
he
found
his
grandfather
dead
and
marguerite
in
possession
of
his
fortune
all
her
persuasions
to
remain
with
her
were
fruitless
he
quitted
her
a
second
time
and
followed
me
to
madrid
he
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
in
forwarding
my
search
but
our
united
endeavours
were
unattended
by
success
the
retreat
which
concealed
agnes
remained
an
impenetrable
mystery
and
i
began
to
abandon
all
hopes
of
recovering
her
about
eight
months
ago
i
was
returning
to
my
hotel
in
a
melancholy
humour
having
past
the
evening
at
the
play-house
the
night
was
dark
and
i
was
unaccompanied
plunged
in
reflections
which
were
far
from
being
agreeable
i
perceived
not
that
three
men
had
followed
me
from
the
theatre
till
on
turning
into
an
unfrequented
street
they
all
attacked
me
at
the
same
time
with
the
utmost
fury
i
sprang
back
a
few
paces
drew
my
sword
and
threw
my
cloak
over
my
left
arm
the
obscurity
of
the
night
was
in
my
favour
for
the
most
part
the
blows
of
the
assassins
being
aimed
at
random
failed
to
touch
me
i
at
length
was
fortunate
enough
to
lay
one
of
my
adversaries
at
my
feet
but
before
this
i
had
already
received
so
many
wounds
and
was
so
warmly
pressed
that
my
destruction
would
have
been
inevitable
had
not
the
clashing
of
swords
called
a
cavalier
to
my
assistance
he
ran
towards
me
with
his
sword
drawn
several
domestics
followed
him
with
torches
his
arrival
made
the
combat
equal
yet
would
not
the
bravoes
abandon
their
design
till
the
servants
were
on
the
point
of
joining
us
they
then
fled
away
and
we
lost
them
in
the
obscurity
the
stranger
now
addressed
himself
to
me
with
politeness
and
enquired
whether
i
was
wounded
faint
with
the
loss
of
blood
i
could
scarcely
thank
him
for
his
seasonable
aid
and
entreat
him
to
let
some
of
his
servants
convey
me
to
the
hotel
de
las
cisternas
i
no
sooner
mentioned
the
name
than
he
profest
himself
an
acquaintance
of
my
father's
and
declared
that
he
would
not
permit
my
being
transported
to
such
a
distance
before
my
wounds
had
been
examined
he
added
that
his
house
was
hard
by
and
begged
me
to
accompany
him
thither
his
manner
was
so
earnest
that
i
could
not
reject
his
offer
and
leaning
upon
his
arm
a
few
minutes
brought
me
to
the
porch
of
a
magnificent
hotel
on
entering
the
house
an
old
grey-headed
domestic
came
to
welcome
my
conductor
he
enquired
when
the
duke
his
master
meant
to
quit
the
country
and
was
answered
that
he
would
remain
there
yet
some
months
my
deliverer
then
desired
the
family
surgeon
to
be
summoned
without
delay
his
orders
were
obeyed
i
was
seated
upon
a
sopha
in
a
noble
apartment
and
my
wounds
being
examined
they
were
declared
to
be
very
slight
the
surgeon
however
advised
me
not
to
expose
myself
to
the
night
air
and
the
stranger
pressed
me
so
earnestly
to
take
a
bed
in
his
house
that
i
consented
to
remain
where
i
was
for
the
present
being
now
left
alone
with
my
deliverer
i
took
the
opportunity
of
thanking
him
in
more
express
terms
than
i
had
done
hitherto
but
he
begged
me
to
be
silent
upon
the
subject
'i
esteem
myself
happy'
said
he
'in
having
had
it
in
my
power
to
render
you
this
little
service
and
i
shall
think
myself
eternally
obliged
to
my
daughter
for
detaining
me
so
late
at
the
convent
of
st
clare
the
high
esteem
in
which
i
have
ever
held
the
marquis
de
las
cisternas
though
accident
has
not
permitted
our
being
so
intimate
as
i
could
wish
makes
me
rejoice
in
the
opportunity
of
making
his
son's
acquaintance
i
am
certain
that
my
brother
in
whose
house
you
now
are
will
lament
his
not
being
at
madrid
to
receive
you
himself
but
in
the
duke's
absence
i
am
master
of
the
family
and
may
assure
you
in
his
name
that
every
thing
in
the
hotel
de
medina
is
perfectly
at
your
disposal'
conceive
my
surprize
lorenzo
at
discovering
in
the
person
of
my
preserver
don
gaston
de
medina
it
was
only
to
be
equalled
by
my
secret
satisfaction
at
the
assurance
that
agnes
inhabited
the
convent
of
st
clare
this
latter
sensation
was
not
a
little
weakened
when
in
answer
to
my
seemingly
indifferent
questions
he
told
me
that
his
daughter
had
really
taken
the
veil
i
suffered
not
my
grief
at
this
circumstance
to
take
root
in
my
mind
i
flattered
myself
with
the
idea
that
my
uncle's
credit
at
the
court
of
rome
would
remove
this
obstacle
and
that
without
difficulty
i
should
obtain
for
my
mistress
a
dispensation
from
her
vows
buoyed
up
with
this
hope
i
calmed
the
uneasiness
of
my
bosom
and
i
redoubled
my
endeavours
to
appear
grateful
for
the
attention
and
pleased
with
the
society
of
don
gaston
a
domestic
now
entered
the
room
and
informed
me
that
the
bravo
whom
i
had
wounded
discovered
some
signs
of
life
i
desired
that
he
might
be
carried
to
my
father's
hotel
and
that
as
soon
as
he
recovered
his
voice
i
would
examine
him
respecting
his
reasons
for
attempting
my
life
i
was
answered
that
he
was
already
able
to
speak
though
with
difficulty
don
gaston's
curiosity
made
him
press
me
to
interrogate
the
assassin
in
his
presence
but
this
curiosity
i
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
gratify
one
reason
was
that
doubting
from
whence
the
blow
came
i
was
unwilling
to
place
before
don
gaston's
eyes
the
guilt
of
a
sister
another
was
that
i
feared
to
be
recognized
for
alphonso
d'alvarada
and
precautions
taken
in
consequence
to
keep
me
from
the
sight
of
agnes
to
avow
my
passion
for
his
daughter
and
endeavour
to
make
him
enter
into
my
schemes
what
i
knew
of
don
gaston's
character
convinced
me
would
be
an
imprudent
step
and
considering
it
to
be
essential
that
he
should
know
me
for
no
other
than
the
conde
de
las
cisternas
i
was
determined
not
to
let
him
hear
the
bravo's
confession
i
insinuated
to
him
that
as
i
suspected
a
lady
to
be
concerned
in
the
business
whose
name
might
accidentally
escape
from
the
assassin
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
examine
the
man
in
private
don
gaston's
delicacy
would
not
permit
his
urging
the
point
any
longer
and
in
consequence
the
bravo
was
conveyed
to
my
hotel
the
next
morning
i
took
leave
of
my
host
who
was
to
return
to
the
duke
on
the
same
day
my
wounds
had
been
so
trifling
that
except
being
obliged
to
wear
my
arm
in
a
sling
for
a
short
time
i
felt
no
inconvenience
from
the
night's
adventure
the
surgeon
who
examined
the
bravo's
wound
declared
it
to
be
mortal
he
had
just
time
to
confess
that
he
had
been
instigated
to
murder
me
by
the
revengeful
donna
rodolpha
and
expired
in
a
few
minutes
after
all
my
thoughts
were
now
bent
upon
getting
to
the
speech
of
my
lovely
nun
theodore
set
himself
to
work
and
for
this
time
with
better
success
he
attacked
the
gardener
of
st
clare
so
forcibly
with
bribes
and
promises
that
the
old
man
was
entirely
gained
over
to
my
interests
and
it
was
settled
that
i
should
be
introduced
into
the
convent
in
the
character
of
his
assistant
the
plan
was
put
into
execution
without
delay
disguised
in
a
common
habit
and
a
black
patch
covering
one
of
my
eyes
i
was
presented
to
the
lady
prioress
who
condescended
to
approve
of
the
gardener's
choice
i
immediately
entered
upon
my
employment
botany
having
been
a
favourite
study
with
me
i
was
by
no
means
at
a
loss
in
my
new
station
for
some
days
i
continued
to
work
in
the
convent
garden
without
meeting
the
object
of
my
disguise
on
the
fourth
morning
i
was
more
successful
i
heard
the
voice
of
agnes
and
was
speeding
towards
the
sound
when
the
sight
of
the
domina
stopped
me
i
drew
back
with
caution
and
concealed
myself
behind
a
thick
clump
of
trees
the
prioress
advanced
and
seated
herself
with
agnes
on
a
bench
at
no
great
distance
i
heard
her
in
an
angry
tone
blame
her
companion's
continual
melancholy
she
told
her
that
to
weep
the
loss
of
any
lover
in
her
situation
was
a
crime
but
that
to
weep
the
loss
of
a
faithless
one
was
folly
and
absurdity
in
the
extreme
agnes
replied
in
so
low
a
voice
that
i
could
not
distinguish
her
words
but
i
perceived
that
she
used
terms
of
gentleness
and
submission
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
young
pensioner
who
informed
the
domina
that
she
was
waited
for
in
the
parlour
the
old
lady
rose
kissed
the
cheek
of
agnes
and
retired
the
newcomer
remained
agnes
spoke
much
to
her
in
praise
of
somebody
whom
i
could
not
make
out
but
her
auditor
seemed
highly
delighted
and
interested
by
the
conversation
the
nun
showed
her
several
letters
the
other
perused
them
with
evident
pleasure
obtained
permission
to
copy
them
and
withdrew
for
that
purpose
to
my
great
satisfaction
no
sooner
was
she
out
of
sight
than
i
quitted
my
concealment
fearing
to
alarm
my
lovely
mistress
i
drew
near
her
gently
intending
to
discover
myself
by
degrees
but
who
for
a
moment
can
deceive
the
eyes
of
love
she
raised
her
head
at
my
approach
and
recognised
me
in
spite
of
my
disguise
at
a
single
glance
she
rose
hastily
from
her
seat
with
an
exclamation
of
surprize
and
attempted
to
retire
but
i
followed
her
detained
her
and
entreated
to
be
heard
persuaded
of
my
falsehood
she
refused
to
listen
to
me
and
ordered
me
positively
to
quit
the
garden
it
was
now
my
turn
to
refuse
i
protested
that
however
dangerous
might
be
the
consequences
i
would
not
leave
her
till
she
had
heard
my
justification
i
assured
her
that
she
had
been
deceived
by
the
artifices
of
her
relations
that
i
could
convince
her
beyond
the
power
of
doubt
that
my
passion
had
been
pure
and
disinterested
and
i
asked
her
what
should
induce
me
to
seek
her
in
the
convent
were
i
influenced
by
the
selfish
motives
which
my
enemies
had
ascribed
to
me
my
prayers
my
arguments
and
vows
not
to
quit
her
till
she
had
promised
to
listen
to
me
united
to
her
fears
lest
the
nuns
should
see
me
with
her
to
her
natural
curiosity
and
to
the
affection
which
she
still
felt
for
me
in
spite
of
my
supposed
desertion
at
length
prevailed
she
told
me
that
to
grant
my
request
at
that
moment
was
impossible
but
she
engaged
to
be
in
the
same
spot
at
eleven
that
night
and
to
converse
with
me
for
the
last
time
having
obtained
this
promise
i
released
her
hand
and
she
fled
back
with
rapidity
towards
the
convent
i
communicated
my
success
to
my
ally
the
old
gardener
he
pointed
out
an
hiding
place
where
i
might
shelter
myself
till
night
without
fear
of
a
discovery
thither
i
betook
myself
at
the
hour
when
i
ought
to
have
retired
with
my
supposed
master
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
appointed
time
the
chillness
of
the
night
was
in
my
favour
since
it
kept
the
other
nuns
confined
to
their
cells
agnes
alone
was
insensible
of
the
inclemency
of
the
air
and
before
eleven
joined
me
at
the
spot
which
had
witnessed
our
former
interview
secure
from
interruption
i
related
to
her
the
true
cause
of
my
disappearing
on
the
fatal
fifth
of
may
she
was
evidently
much
affected
by
my
narrative
when
it
was
concluded
she
confessed
the
injustice
of
her
suspicions
and
blamed
herself
for
having
taken
the
veil
through
despair
at
my
ingratitude
'but
now
it
is
too
late
to
repine'
she
added
'the
die
is
thrown
i
have
pronounced
my
vows
and
dedicated
myself
to
the
service
of
heaven
i
am
sensible
how
ill
i
am
calculated
for
a
convent
my
disgust
at
a
monastic
life
increases
daily
ennui
and
discontent
are
my
constant
companions
and
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
the
passion
which
i
formerly
felt
for
one
so
near
being
my
husband
is
not
yet
extinguished
in
my
bosom
but
we
must
part
insuperable
barriers
divide
us
from
each
other
and
on
this
side
the
grave
we
must
never
meet
again'
i
now
exerted
myself
to
prove
that
our
union
was
not
so
impossible
as
she
seemed
to
think
it
i
vaunted
to
her
the
cardinal-duke
of
lerma's
influence
at
the
court
of
rome
i
assured
her
that
i
should
easily
obtain
a
dispensation
from
her
vows
and
i
doubted
not
but
don
gaston
would
coincide
with
my
views
when
informed
of
my
real
name
and
long
attachment
agnes
replied
that
since
i
encouraged
such
an
hope
i
could
know
but
little
of
her
father
liberal
and
kind
in
every
other
respect
superstition
formed
the
only
stain
upon
his
character
upon
this
head
he
was
inflexible
he
sacrificed
his
dearest
interests
to
his
scruples
and
would
consider
it
an
insult
to
suppose
him
capable
of
authorising
his
daughter
to
break
her
vows
to
heaven
'but
suppose'
said
i
interrupting
her
'suppose
that
he
should
disapprove
of
our
union
let
him
remain
ignorant
of
my
proceedings
till
i
have
rescued
you
from
the
prison
in
which
you
are
now
confined
once
my
wife
you
are
free
from
his
authority
i
need
from
him
no
pecuniary
assistance
and
when
he
sees
his
resentment
to
be
unavailing
he
will
doubtless
restore
you
to
his
favour
but
let
the
worst
happen
should
don
gaston
be
irreconcileable
my
relations
will
vie
with
each
other
in
making
you
forget
his
loss
and
you
will
find
in
my
father
a
substitute
for
the
parent
of
whom
i
shall
deprive
you'
'don
raymond'
replied
agnes
in
a
firm
and
resolute
voice
'i
love
my
father
he
has
treated
me
harshly
in
this
one
instance
but
i
have
received
from
him
in
every
other
so
many
proofs
of
love
that
his
affection
is
become
necessary
to
my
existence
were
i
to
quit
the
convent
he
never
would
forgive
me
nor
can
i
think
that
on
his
deathbed
he
would
leave
me
his
curse
without
shuddering
at
the
very
idea
besides
i
am
conscious
myself
that
my
vows
are
binding
wilfully
did
i
contract
my
engagement
with
heaven
i
cannot
break
it
without
a
crime
then
banish
from
your
mind
the
idea
of
our
being
ever
united
i
am
devoted
to
religion
and
however
i
may
grieve
at
our
separation
i
would
oppose
obstacles
myself
to
what
i
feel
would
render
me
guilty'
i
strove
to
overrule
these
ill-grounded
scruples
we
were
still
disputing
upon
the
subject
when
the
convent
bell
summoned
the
nuns
to
matins
agnes
was
obliged
to
attend
them
but
she
left
me
not
till
i
had
compelled
her
to
promise
that
on
the
following
night
she
would
be
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
hour
these
meetings
continued
for
several
weeks
uninterrupted
and
'tis
now
lorenzo
that
i
must
implore
your
indulgence
reflect
upon
our
situation
our
youth
our
long
attachment
weigh
all
the
circumstances
which
attended
our
assignations
and
you
will
confess
the
temptation
to
have
been
irresistible
you
will
even
pardon
me
when
i
acknowledge
that
in
an
unguarded
moment
the
honour
of
agnes
was
sacrificed
to
my
passion'
lorenzo's
eyes
sparkled
with
fury
a
deep
crimson
spread
itself
over
his
face
he
started
from
his
seat
and
attempted
to
draw
his
sword
the
marquis
was
aware
of
his
movement
and
caught
his
hand
he
pressed
it
affectionately
'my
friend
my
brother
hear
me
to
the
conclusion
till
then
restrain
your
passion
and
be
at
least
convinced
that
if
what
i
have
related
is
criminal
the
blame
must
fall
upon
me
and
not
upon
your
sister'
lorenzo
suffered
himself
to
be
prevailed
upon
by
don
raymond's
entreaties
he
resumed
his
place
and
listened
to
the
rest
of
the
narrative
with
a
gloomy
and
impatient
countenance
the
marquis
thus
continued
'scarcely
was
the
first
burst
of
passion
past
when
agnes
recovering
herself
started
from
my
arms
with
horror
she
called
me
infamous
seducer
loaded
me
with
the
bitterest
reproaches
and
beat
her
bosom
in
all
the
wildness
of
delirium
ashamed
of
my
imprudence
i
with
difficulty
found
words
to
excuse
myself
i
endeavoured
to
console
her
i
threw
myself
at
her
feet
and
entreated
her
forgiveness
she
forced
her
hand
from
me
which
i
had
taken
and
would
have
prest
to
my
lips
'touch
me
not'
she
cried
with
a
violence
which
terrified
me
'monster
of
perfidy
and
ingratitude
how
have
i
been
deceived
in
you
i
looked
upon
you
as
my
friend
my
protector
i
trusted
myself
in
your
hands
with
confidence
and
relying
upon
your
honour
thought
that
mine
ran
no
risque
and
'tis
by
you
whom
i
adored
that
i
am
covered
with
infamy
'tis
by
you
that
i
have
been
seduced
into
breaking
my
vows
to
god
that
i
am
reduced
to
a
level
with
the
basest
of
my
sex
shame
upon
you
villain
you
shall
never
see
me
more'
she
started
from
the
bank
on
which
she
was
seated
i
endeavoured
to
detain
her
but
she
disengaged
herself
from
me
with
violence
and
took
refuge
in
the
convent
i
retired
filled
with
confusion
and
inquietude
the
next
morning
i
failed
not
as
usual
to
appear
in
the
garden
but
agnes
was
no
where
to
be
seen
at
night
i
waited
for
her
at
the
place
where
we
generally
met
i
found
no
better
success
several
days
and
nights
passed
away
in
the
same
manner
at
length
i
saw
my
offended
mistress
cross
the
walk
on
whose
borders
i
was
working
she
was
accompanied
by
the
same
young
pensioner
on
whose
arm
she
seemed
from
weakness
obliged
to
support
herself
she
looked
upon
me
for
a
moment
but
instantly
turned
her
head
away
i
waited
her
return
but
she
passed
on
to
the
convent
without
paying
any
attention
to
me
or
the
penitent
looks
with
which
i
implored
her
forgiveness
as
soon
as
the
nuns
were
retired
the
old
gardener
joined
me
with
a
sorrowful
air
'segnor'
said
he
'it
grieves
me
to
say
that
i
can
be
no
longer
of
use
to
you
the
lady
whom
you
used
to
meet
has
just
assured
me
that
if
i
admitted
you
again
into
the
garden
she
would
discover
the
whole
business
to
the
lady
prioress
she
bade
me
tell
you
also
that
your
presence
was
an
insult
and
that
if
you
still
possess
the
least
respect
for
her
you
will
never
attempt
to
see
her
more
excuse
me
then
for
informing
you
that
i
can
favour
your
disguise
no
longer
should
the
prioress
be
acquainted
with
my
conduct
she
might
not
be
contented
with
dismissing
me
her
service
out
of
revenge
she
might
accuse
me
of
having
profaned
the
convent
and
cause
me
to
be
thrown
into
the
prisons
of
the
inquisition'
fruitless
were
my
attempts
to
conquer
his
resolution
he
denied
me
all
future
entrance
into
the
garden
and
agnes
persevered
in
neither
letting
me
see
or
hear
from
her
in
about
a
fortnight
after
a
violent
illness
which
had
seized
my
father
obliged
me
to
set
out
for
andalusia
i
hastened
thither
and
as
i
imagined
found
the
marquis
at
the
point
of
death
though
on
its
first
appearance
his
complaint
was
declared
mortal
he
lingered
out
several
months
during
which
my
attendance
upon
him
during
his
malady
and
the
occupation
of
settling
his
affairs
after
his
decease
permitted
not
my
quitting
andalusia
within
these
four
days
i
returned
to
madrid
and
on
arriving
at
my
hotel
i
there
found
this
letter
waiting
for
me
here
the
marquis
unlocked
the
drawer
of
a
cabinet
he
took
out
a
folded
paper
which
he
presented
to
his
auditor
lorenzo
opened
it
and
recognised
his
sister's
hand
the
contents
were
as
follows
into
what
an
abyss
of
misery
have
you
plunged
me
raymond
you
force
me
to
become
as
criminal
as
yourself
i
had
resolved
never
to
see
you
more
if
possible
to
forget
you
if
not
only
to
remember
you
with
hate
a
being
for
whom
i
already
feel
a
mother's
tenderness
solicits
me
to
pardon
my
seducer
and
apply
to
his
love
for
the
means
of
preservation
raymond
your
child
lives
in
my
bosom
i
tremble
at
the
vengeance
of
the
prioress
i
tremble
much
for
myself
yet
more
for
the
innocent
creature
whose
existence
depends
upon
mine
both
of
us
are
lost
should
my
situation
be
discovered
advise
me
then
what
steps
to
take
but
seek
not
to
see
me
the
gardener
who
undertakes
to
deliver
this
is
dismissed
and
we
have
nothing
to
hope
from
that
quarter
the
man
engaged
in
his
place
is
of
incorruptible
fidelity
the
best
means
of
conveying
to
me
your
answer
is
by
concealing
it
under
the
great
statue
of
st
francis
which
stands
in
the
capuchin
cathedral
thither
i
go
every
thursday
to
confession
and
shall
easily
have
an
opportunity
of
securing
your
letter
i
hear
that
you
are
now
absent
from
madrid
need
i
entreat
you
to
write
the
very
moment
of
your
return
i
will
not
think
it
ah
raymond
mine
is
a
cruel
situation
deceived
by
my
nearest
relations
compelled
to
embrace
a
profession
the
duties
of
which
i
am
ill-calculated
to
perform
conscious
of
the
sanctity
of
those
duties
and
seduced
into
violating
them
by
one
whom
i
least
suspected
of
perfidy
i
am
now
obliged
by
circumstances
to
chuse
between
death
and
perjury
woman's
timidity
and
maternal
affection
permit
me
not
to
balance
in
the
choice
i
feel
all
the
guilt
into
which
i
plunge
myself
when
i
yield
to
the
plan
which
you
before
proposed
to
me
my
poor
father's
death
which
has
taken
place
since
we
met
has
removed
one
obstacle
he
sleeps
in
his
grave
and
i
no
longer
dread
his
anger
but
from
the
anger
of
god
oh
raymond
who
shall
shield
me
who
can
protect
me
against
my
conscience
against
myself
i
dare
not
dwell
upon
these
thoughts
they
will
drive
me
mad
i
have
taken
my
resolution
procure
a
dispensation
from
my
vows
i
am
ready
to
fly
with
you
write
to
me
my
husband
tell
me
that
absence
has
not
abated
your
love
tell
me
that
you
will
rescue
from
death
your
unborn
child
and
its
unhappy
mother
i
live
in
all
the
agonies
of
terror
every
eye
which
is
fixed
upon
me
seems
to
read
my
secret
and
my
shame
and
you
are
the
cause
of
those
agonies
oh
when
my
heart
first
loved
you
how
little
did
it
suspect
you
of
making
it
feel
such
pangs
agnes
having
perused
the
letter
lorenzo
restored
it
in
silence
the
marquis
replaced
it
in
the
cabinet
and
then
proceeded
'excessive
was
my
joy
at
reading
this
intelligence
so
earnestly-desired
so
little
expected
my
plan
was
soon
arranged
when
don
gaston
discovered
to
me
his
daughter's
retreat
i
entertained
no
doubt
of
her
readiness
to
quit
the
convent
i
had
therefore
entrusted
the
cardinal-duke
of
lerma
with
the
whole
affair
who
immediately
busied
himself
in
obtaining
the
necessary
bull
fortunately
i
had
afterwards
neglected
to
stop
his
proceedings
not
long
since
i
received
a
letter
from
him
stating
that
he
expected
daily
to
receive
the
order
from
the
court
of
rome
upon
this
i
would
willingly
have
relyed
but
the
cardinal
wrote
me
word
that
i
must
find
some
means
of
conveying
agnes
out
of
the
convent
unknown
to
the
prioress
he
doubted
not
but
this
latter
would
be
much
incensed
by
losing
a
person
of
such
high
rank
from
her
society
and
consider
the
renunciation
of
agnes
as
an
insult
to
her
house
he
represented
her
as
a
woman
of
a
violent
and
revengeful
character
capable
of
proceeding
to
the
greatest
extremities
it
was
therefore
to
be
feared
lest
by
confining
agnes
in
the
convent
she
should
frustrate
my
hopes
and
render
the
pope's
mandate
unavailing
influenced
by
this
consideration
i
resolved
to
carry
off
my
mistress
and
conceal
her
till
the
arrival
of
the
expected
bull
in
the
cardinal-duke's
estate
he
approved
of
my
design
and
profest
himself
ready
to
give
a
shelter
to
the
fugitive
i
next
caused
the
new
gardener
of
st
clare
to
be
seized
privately
and
confined
in
my
hotel
by
this
means
i
became
master
of
the
key
to
the
garden
door
and
i
had
now
nothing
more
to
do
than
prepare
agnes
for
the
elopement
this
was
done
by
the
letter
which
you
saw
me
deliver
this
evening
i
told
her
in
it
that
i
should
be
ready
to
receive
her
at
twelve
tomorrow
night
that
i
had
secured
the
key
of
the
garden
and
that
she
might
depend
upon
a
speedy
release
you
have
now
lorenzo
heard
the
whole
of
my
long
narrative
i
have
nothing
to
say
in
my
excuse
save
that
my
intentions
towards
your
sister
have
been
ever
the
most
honourable
that
it
has
always
been
and
still
is
my
design
to
make
her
my
wife
and
that
i
trust
when
you
consider
these
circumstances
our
youth
and
our
attachment
you
will
not
only
forgive
our
momentary
lapse
from
virtue
but
will
aid
me
in
repairing
my
faults
to
agnes
and
securing
a
lawful
title
to
her
person
and
her
heart
o
you
whom
vanity's
light
bark
conveys
on
fame's
mad
voyage
by
the
wind
of
praise
with
what
a
shifting

your
course
you
ply
for
ever
sunk
too
low
or
borne
too
high
who

glory

but
short
repose
a
breath
revives

and
a

here
the
marquis
concluded
his
adventures
lorenzo
before
he
could
determine
on
his
reply
past
some
moments
in
reflection
at
length
he
broke
silence
'raymond'
said
he
taking
his
hand
'strict
honour
would
oblige
me
to
wash
off
in
your
blood
the
stain
thrown
upon
my
family
but
the
circumstances
of
your
case
forbid
me
to
consider
you
as
an
enemy
the
temptation
was
too
great
to
be
resisted
'tis
the
superstition
of
my
relations
which
has
occasioned
these
misfortunes
and
they
are
more
the
offenders
than
yourself
and
agnes
what
has
past
between
you
cannot
be
recalled
but
may
yet
be
repaired
by
uniting
you
to
my
sister
you
have
ever
been
you
still
continue
to
be
my
dearest
and
indeed
my
only
friend
i
feel
for
agnes
the
truest
affection
and
there
is
no
one
on
whom
i
would
bestow
her
more
willingly
than
on
yourself
pursue
then
your
design
i
will
accompany
you
tomorrow
night
and
conduct
her
myself
to
the
house
of
the
cardinal
my
presence
will
be
a
sanction
for
her
conduct
and
prevent
her
incurring
blame
by
her
flight
from
the
convent'
the
marquis
thanked
him
in
terms
by
no
means
deficient
in
gratitude
lorenzo
then
informed
him
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
apprehend
from
donna
rodolpha's
enmity
five
months
had
already
elapsed
since
in
an
excess
of
passion
she
broke
a
blood-vessel
and
expired
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
he
then
proceeded
to
mention
the
interests
of
antonia
the
marquis
was
much
surprized
at
hearing
of
this
new
relation
his
father
had
carried
his
hatred
of
elvira
to
the
grave
and
had
never
given
the
least
hint
that
he
knew
what
was
become
of
his
eldest
son's
widow
don
raymond
assured
his
friend
that
he
was
not
mistaken
in
supposing
him
ready
to
acknowledge
his
sister-in-law
and
her
amiable
daughter
the
preparations
for
the
elopement
would
not
permit
his
visiting
them
the
next
day
but
in
the
meanwhile
he
desired
lorenzo
to
assure
them
of
his
friendship
and
to
supply
elvira
upon
his
account
with
any
sums
which
she
might
want
this
the
youth
promised
to
do
as
soon
as
her
abode
should
be
known
to
him
he
then
took
leave
of
his
future
brother
and
returned
to
the
palace
de
medina
the
day
was
already
on
the
point
of
breaking
when
the
marquis
retired
to
his
chamber
conscious
that
his
narrative
would
take
up
some
hours
and
wishing
to
secure
himself
from
interruption
on
returning
to
the
hotel
he
ordered
his
attendants
not
to
sit
up
for
him
consequently
he
was
somewhat
surprised
on
entering
his
antiroom
to
find
theodore
established
there
the
page
sat
near
a
table
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
and
was
so
totally
occupied
by
his
employment
that
he
perceived
not
his
lord's
approach
the
marquis
stopped
to
observe
him
theodore
wrote
a
few
lines
then
paused
and
scratched
out
a
part
of
the
writing
then
wrote
again
smiled
and
seemed
highly
pleased
with
what
he
had
been
about
at
last
he
threw
down
his
pen
sprang
from
his
chair
and
clapped
his
hands
together
joyfully
'there
it
is'
cried
he
aloud
'now
they
are
charming'
his
transports
were
interrupted
by
a
laugh
from
the
marquis
who
suspected
the
nature
of
his
employment
'what
is
so
charming
theodore'
the
youth
started
and
looked
round
he
blushed
ran
to
the
table
seized
the
paper
on
which
he
had
been
writing
and
concealed
it
in
confusion
'oh
my
lord
i
knew
not
that
you
were
so
near
me
can
i
be
of
use
to
you
lucas
is
already
gone
to
bed'
'i
shall
follow
his
example
when
i
have
given
my
opinion
of
your
verses'
'my
verses
my
lord'
'nay
i
am
sure
that
you
have
been
writing
some
for
nothing
else
could
have
kept
you
awake
till
this
time
of
the
morning
where
are
they
theodore
i
shall
like
to
see
your
composition'
theodore's
cheeks
glowed
with
still
deeper
crimson
he
longed
to
show
his
poetry
but
first
chose
to
be
pressed
for
it
'indeed
my
lord
they
are
not
worthy
your
attention'
'not
these
verses
which
you
just
now
declared
to
be
so
charming
come
come
let
me
see
whether
our
opinions
are
the
same
i
promise
that
you
shall
find
in
me
an
indulgent
critic'
the
boy
produced
his
paper
with
seeming
reluctance
but
the
satisfaction
which
sparkled
in
his
dark
expressive
eyes
betrayed
the
vanity
of
his
little
bosom
the
marquis
smiled
while
he
observed
the
emotions
of
an
heart
as
yet
but
little
skilled
in
veiling
its
sentiments
he
seated
himself
upon
a
sopha
theodore
while
hope
and
fear
contended
on
his
anxious
countenance
waited
with
inquietude
for
his
master's
decision
while
the
marquis
read
the
following
lines
love
and
age
the
night
was
dark
the
wind
blew
cold
anacreon
grown
morose
and
old
sat
by
his
fire
and
fed
the
chearful
flame
sudden
the
cottage-door
expands
and
lo
before
him
cupid
stands
casts
round
a
friendly
glance
and
greets
him
by
his
name
'what
is
it
thou'
the
startled
sire
in
sullen
tone
exclaimed
while
ire
with
crimson
flushed
his
pale
and
wrinkled
cheek
'wouldst
thou
again
with
amorous
rage
inflame
my
bosom
steeled
by
age
vain
boy
to
pierce
my
breast
thine
arrows
are
too
weak
'what
seek
you
in
this
desart
drear
no
smiles
or
sports

here

these
vallies

eternal
winter

the
plains
age
in
my
house
despotic
reigns
my
garden

no
flower
my
bosom
boasts
no
heat
'begone
and
seek
the
blooming
bower
where
some
ripe
virgin
courts
thy
power
or
bid
provoking
dreams
flit
round
her
bed
on
damon's
amorous
breast
repose
wanton--on
chloe's
lip
of
rose
or
make
her
blushing
cheek
a
pillow
for
thy
head
'be
such
thy
haunts
these
regions
cold
avoid
nor
think
grown
wise
and
old
this
hoary
head
again
thy
yoke
shall
bear
remembering
that
my
fairest
years
by
thee
were
marked
with
sighs
and
tears
i
think
thy
friendship
false
and
shun
the
guileful
snare
'i
have
not
yet
forgot
the
pains
i
felt
while
bound
in
julia's
chains
the
ardent
flames
with
which
my
bosom
burned
the
nights
i
passed
deprived
of
rest
the
jealous
pangs
which
racked
my
breast
my
disappointed
hopes
and
passion
unreturned
'then
fly
and
curse
mine
eyes
no
more
fly
from
my
peaceful
cottage-door
no
day
no
hour
no
moment
shalt
thou
stay
i
know
thy
falsehood

arts
distrust
thy
smiles
and
fear
thy
darts
traitor
begone
and
seek
some
other
to
betray'
'does
age
old
man
your
wits
confound'
replied
the
offended
god
and
frowned
his
frown
was
sweet
as
is
the
virgin's
smile
'do
you
to
me
these
words
address
to
me
who
do
not
love
you
less
though
you
my
friendship
scorn
and
pleasures
past
revile
'if
one
proud
fair
you
chanced
to
find
an
hundred
other
nymphs

kind
whose
smiles
might
well
for
julia's
frowns
atone
but
such
is
man
his
partial
hand
unnumbered
favours
writes
on
sand
but
stamps
one
little
fault
on
solid
lasting
stone
'ingrate
who
led
thee
to
the
wave
at
noon
where
lesbia
loved
to

named
the
bower

and
who
when
caelia
shrieked
for
aid

you
with
kisses
hush
the
maid
what
other
was't
than
love
oh
false
anacreon
say
'then
you
could
call
me--gentle
boy
my
only
bliss
my
source
of
joy--
then
you
could
prize
me
dearer

your
soul
could
kiss
and
dance
me
on
your
knees
and
swear
not

itself
would
please
had
not
the
lip
of
love
first
touched
the
flowing
bowl
'must

i
for

deplore
banished

from
your
favour

ah
no
my
fears
that
smile
denies
that
heaving
breast
those
sparkling
eyes
declare
me
ever
dear
and
all
my
faults
forgiven
'again

once
more
their
revels
keep'--
a
feather
now
of
golden
hue
he
smiling
from
his
pinion
drew
this
to
the
poet's
hand
the
boy
commits
and
straight
before
anacreon's
eyes
the
fairest
dreams
of
fancy
rise
and
round
his
favoured
head
wild
inspiration
flits
his
bosom
glows
with
amorous
fire
eager
he
grasps
the
magic
lyre
swift
o'er
the
tuneful
chords
his
fingers
move
the
feather
plucked
from
cupid's
wing
sweeps
the
too-long-neglected
string
while
soft
anacreon
sings
the
power
and
praise
of
love
soon
as
that
name
was
heard
the
woods
shook
off
their
snows
the
melting
floods
broke
their
cold
chains
and
winter
fled
away
once
more
the
earth
was
deckt
with
flowers
mild
zephyrs
breathed
through
blooming
bowers
high
towered
the
glorious
sun
and
poured
the
blaze
of
day
attracted
by
the
harmonious
sound
sylvans
and
fauns
the
cot
surround
and
curious
crowd
the
minstrel
to
behold
the
wood-nymphs
haste
the
spell
to
prove
eager
they
run
they
list
they
love
and
while
they
hear
the
strain
forget
the
man
is
old
cupid
to
nothing
constant
long
perched
on
the
harp
attends
the
song
or
stifles
with
a
kiss
the
dulcet
notes
now
on
the
poet's
breast
reposes
now
twines
his
hoary
locks
with
roses
or
borne
on
wings
of
gold
in
wanton
circle
floats
then
thus
anacreon--'i
no
more
at
other
shrine
my
vows
will
pour
since
cupid
deigns
my
numbers
to
inspire
from
phoebus
or
the
blue-eyed
maid
now
shall
my
verse
request
no
aid
for
love
alone
shall
be
the
patron
of
my
lyre
'in
lofty
strain
of
earlier
days
i
spread
the
king's
or
hero's
praise
and
struck
the
martial
chords
with
epic
fire
but
farewell
hero
farewell
king
your
deeds
my
lips
no
more
shall
sing
for
love
alone
shall
be
the
subject
of
my
lyre
the
marquis
returned
the
paper
with
a
smile
of
encouragement
'your
little
poem
pleases
me
much'
said
he
'however
you
must
not
count
my
opinion
for
anything
i
am
no
judge
of
verses
and
for
my
own
part
never
composed
more
than
six
lines
in
my
life
those
six
produced
so
unlucky
an
effect
that
i
am
fully
resolved
never
to
compose
another
but
i
wander
from
my
subject
i
was
going
to
say
that
you
cannot
employ
your
time
worse
than
in
making
verses
an
author
whether
good
or
bad
or
between
both
is
an
animal
whom
everybody
is
privileged
to
attack
for
though
all
are
not
able
to
write
books
all
conceive
themselves
able
to
judge
them
a
bad
composition
carries
with
it
its
own
punishment
contempt
and
ridicule
a
good
one
excites
envy
and
entails
upon
its
author
a
thousand
mortifications
he
finds
himself
assailed
by
partial
and
ill-humoured
criticism
one
man
finds
fault
with
the
plan
another
with
the
style
a
third
with
the
precept
which
it
strives
to
inculcate
and
they
who
cannot
succeed
in
finding
fault
with
the
book
employ
themselves
in
stigmatizing
its
author
they
maliciously
rake
out
from
obscurity
every
little
circumstance
which
may
throw
ridicule
upon
his
private
character
or
conduct
and
aim
at
wounding
the
man
since
they
cannot
hurt
the
writer
in
short
to
enter
the
lists
of
literature
is
wilfully
to
expose
yourself
to
the
arrows
of
neglect
ridicule
envy
and
disappointment
whether
you
write
well
or
ill
be
assured
that
you
will
not
escape
from
blame
indeed
this
circumstance
contains
a
young
author's
chief
consolation
he
remembers
that
lope
de
vega
and
calderona
had
unjust
and
envious
critics
and
he
modestly
conceives
himself
to
be
exactly
in
their
predicament
but
i
am
conscious
that
all
these
sage
observations
are
thrown
away
upon
you
authorship
is
a
mania
to
conquer
which
no
reasons
are
sufficiently
strong
and
you
might
as
easily
persuade
me
not
to
love
as
i
persuade
you
not
to
write
however
if
you
cannot
help
being
occasionally
seized
with
a
poetical
paroxysm
take
at
least
the
precaution
of
communicating
your
verses
to
none
but
those
whose
partiality
for
you
secures
their
approbation'
'then
my
lord
you
do
not
think
these
lines
tolerable'
said
theodore
with
an
humble
and
dejected
air
'you
mistake
my
meaning
as
i
said
before
they
have
pleased
me
much
but
my
regard
for
you
makes
me
partial
and
others
might
judge
them
less
favourably
i
must
still
remark
that
even
my
prejudice
in
your
favour
does
not
blind
me
so
much
as
to
prevent
my
observing
several
faults
for
instance
you
make
a
terrible
confusion
of
metaphors
you
are
too
apt
to
make
the
strength
of
your
lines
consist
more
in
the
words
than
sense
some
of
the
verses
only
seem
introduced
in
order
to
rhyme
with
others
and
most
of
the
best
ideas
are
borrowed
from
other
poets
though
possibly
you
are
unconscious
of
the
theft
yourself
these
faults
may
occasionally
be
excused
in
a
work
of
length
but
a
short
poem
must
be
correct
and
perfect'
'all
this
is
true
segnor
but
you
should
consider
that
i
only
write
for
pleasure'
'your
defects
are
the
less
excusable
their
incorrectness
may
be
forgiven
in
those
who
work
for
money
who
are
obliged
to
compleat
a
given
task
in
a
given
time
and
are
paid
according
to
the
bulk
not
value
of
their
productions
but
in
those
whom
no
necessity
forces
to
turn
author
who
merely
write
for
fame
and
have
full
leisure
to
polish
their
compositions
faults
are
impardonable
and
merit
the
sharpest
arrows
of
criticism'
the
marquis
rose
from
the
sopha
the
page
looked
discouraged
and
melancholy
and
this
did
not
escape
his
master's
observation
'however'
added
he
smiling
'i
think
that
these
lines
do
you
no
discredit
your
versification
is
tolerably
easy
and
your
ear
seems
to
be
just
the
perusal
of
your
little
poem
upon
the
whole
gave
me
much
pleasure
and
if
it
is
not
asking
too
great
a
favour
i
shall
be
highly
obliged
to
you
for
a
copy'
the
youth's
countenance
immediately
cleared
up
he
perceived
not
the
smile
half
approving
half
ironical
which
accompanied
the
request
and
he
promised
the
copy
with
great
readiness
the
marquis
withdrew
to
his
chamber
much
amused
by
the
instantaneous
effect
produced
upon
theodore's
vanity
by
the
conclusion
of
his
criticism
he
threw
himself
upon
his
couch
sleep
soon
stole
over
him
and
his
dreams
presented
him
with
the
most
flattering
pictures
of
happiness
with
agnes
on
reaching
the
hotel
de
medina
lorenzo's
first
care
was
to
enquire
for
letters
he
found
several
waiting
for
him
but
that
which
he
sought
was
not
amongst
them
leonella
had
found
it
impossible
to
write
that
evening
however
her
impatience
to
secure
don
christoval's
heart
on
which
she
flattered
herself
with
having
made
no
slight
impression
permitted
her
not
to
pass
another
day
without
informing
him
where
she
was
to
be
found
on
her
return
from
the
capuchin
church
she
had
related
to
her
sister
with
exultation
how
attentive
an
handsome
cavalier
had
been
to
her
as
also
how
his
companion
had
undertaken
to
plead
antonia's
cause
with
the
marquis
de
las
cisternas
elvira
received
this
intelligence
with
sensations
very
different
from
those
with
which
it
was
communicated
she
blamed
her
sister's
imprudence
in
confiding
her
history
to
an
absolute
stranger
and
expressed
her
fears
lest
this
inconsiderate
step
should
prejudice
the
marquis
against
her
the
greatest
of
her
apprehensions
she
concealed
in
her
own
breast
she
had
observed
with
inquietude
that
at
the
mention
of
lorenzo
a
deep
blush
spread
itself
over
her
daughter's
cheek
the
timid
antonia
dared
not
to
pronounce
his
name
without
knowing
wherefore
she
felt
embarrassed
when
he
was
made
the
subject
of
discourse
and
endeavoured
to
change
the
conversation
to
ambrosio
elvira
perceived
the
emotions
of
this
young
bosom
in
consequence
she
insisted
upon
leonella's
breaking
her
promise
to
the
cavaliers
a
sigh
which
on
hearing
this
order
escaped
from
antonia
confirmed
the
wary
mother
in
her
resolution
through
this
resolution
leonella
was
determined
to
break
she
conceived
it
to
be
inspired
by
envy
and
that
her
sister
dreaded
her
being
elevated
above
her
without
imparting
her
design
to
anyone
she
took
an
opportunity
of
dispatching
the
following
note
to
lorenzo
it
was
delivered
to
him
as
soon
as
he
woke
'doubtless
segnor
don
lorenzo
you
have
frequently
accused
me
of
ingratitude
and
forgetfulness
but
on
the
word
of
a
virgin
it
was
out
of
my
power
to
perform
my
promise
yesterday
i
know
not
in
what
words
to
inform
you
how
strange
a
reception
my
sister
gave
your
kind
wish
to
visit
her
she
is
an
odd
woman
with
many
good
points
about
her
but
her
jealousy
of
me
frequently
makes
her
conceive
notions
quite
unaccountable
on
hearing
that
your
friend
had
paid
some
little
attention
to
me
she
immediately
took
the
alarm
she
blamed
my
conduct
and
has
absolutely
forbidden
me
to
let
you
know
our
abode
my
strong
sense
of
gratitude
for
your
kind
offers
of
service
and

shall
i
confess
it
my
desire
to
behold
once
more
the
too
amiable
don
christoval
will
not
permit
my
obeying
her
injunctions
i
have
therefore
stolen
a
moment
to
inform
you
that
we
lodge
in
the
strada
di
san
iago
four
doors
from
the
palace
d'albornos
and
nearly
opposite
to
the
barber's
miguel
coello
enquire
for
donna
elvira
dalfa
since
in
compliance
with
her
father-in-law's
order
my
sister
continues
to
be
called
by
her
maiden
name
at
eight
this
evening
you
will
be
sure
of
finding
us
but
let
not
a
word
drop
which
may
raise
a
suspicion
of
my
having
written
this
letter
should
you
see
the
conde
d'ossorio
tell
him

i
blush
while
i
declare
it

tell
him
that
his
presence
will
be
but
too
acceptable
to
the
sympathetic
leonella
the
latter
sentences
were
written
in
red
ink
to
express
the
blushes
of
her
cheek
while
she
committed
an
outrage
upon
her
virgin
modesty
lorenzo
had
no
sooner
perused
this
note
than
he
set
out
in
search
of
don
christoval
not
being
able
to
find
him
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
proceeded
to
donna
elvira's
alone
to
leonella's
infinite
disappointment
the
domestic
by
whom
he
sent
up
his
name
having
already
declared
his
lady
to
be
at
home
she
had
no
excuse
for
refusing
his
visit
yet
she
consented
to
receive
it
with
much
reluctance
that
reluctance
was
increased
by
the
changes
which
his
approach
produced
in
antonia's
countenance
nor
was
it
by
any
means
abated
when
the
youth
himself
appeared
the
symmetry
of
his
person
animation
of
his
features
and
natural
elegance
of
his
manners
and
address
convinced
elvira
that
such
a
guest
must
be
dangerous
for
her
daughter
she
resolved
to
treat
him
with
distant
politeness
to
decline
his
services
with
gratitude
for
the
tender
of
them
and
to
make
him
feel
without
offence
that
his
future
visits
would
be
far
from
acceptable
on
his
entrance
he
found
elvira
who
was
indisposed
reclining
upon
a
sopha
antonia
sat
by
her
embroidery
frame
and
leonella
in
a
pastoral
dress
held
'montemayor's
diana'
in
spite
of
her
being
the
mother
of
antonia
lorenzo
could
not
help
expecting
to
find
in
elvira
leonella's
true
sister
and
the
daughter
of
'as
honest
a
painstaking
shoe-maker
as
any
in
cordova'
a
single
glance
was
sufficient
to
undeceive
him
he
beheld
a
woman
whose
features
though
impaired
by
time
and
sorrow
still
bore
the
marks
of
distinguished
beauty
a
serious
dignity
reigned
upon
her
countenance
but
was
tempered
by
a
grace
and
sweetness
which
rendered
her
truly
enchanting
lorenzo
fancied
that
she
must
have
resembled
her
daughter
in
her
youth
and
readily
excused
the
imprudence
of
the
late
conde
de
las
cisternas
she
desired
him
to
be
seated
and
immediately
resumed
her
place
upon
the
sopha
antonia
received
him
with
a
simple
reverence
and
continued
her
work
her
cheeks
were
suffused
with
crimson
and
she
strove
to
conceal
her
emotion
by
leaning
over
her
embroidery
frame
her
aunt
also
chose
to
play
off
her
airs
of
modesty
she
affected
to
blush
and
tremble
and
waited
with
her
eyes
cast
down
to
receive
as
she
expected
the
compliments
of
don
christoval
finding
after
some
time
that
no
sign
of
his
approach
was
given
she
ventured
to
look
round
the
room
and
perceived
with
vexation
that
medina
was
unaccompanied
impatience
would
not
permit
her
waiting
for
an
explanation
interrupting
lorenzo
who
was
delivering
raymond's
message
she
desired
to
know
what
was
become
of
his
friend
he
who
thought
it
necessary
to
maintain
himself
in
her
good
graces
strove
to
console
her
under
her
disappointment
by
committing
a
little
violence
upon
truth
'ah
segnora'
he
replied
in
a
melancholy
voice
'how
grieved
will
he
be
at
losing
this
opportunity
of
paying
you
his
respects
a
relation's
illness
has
obliged
him
to
quit
madrid
in
haste
but
on
his
return
he
will
doubtless
seize
the
first
moment
with
transport
to
throw
himself
at
your
feet'
as
he
said
this
his
eyes
met
those
of
elvira
she
punished
his
falsehood
sufficiently
by
darting
at
him
a
look
expressive
of
displeasure
and
reproach
neither
did
the
deceit
answer
his
intention
vexed
and
disappointed
leonella
rose
from
her
seat
and
retired
in
dudgeon
to
her
own
apartment
lorenzo
hastened
to
repair
the
fault
which
had
injured
him
in
elvira's
opinion
he
related
his
conversation
with
the
marquis
respecting
her
he
assured
her
that
raymond
was
prepared
to
acknowledge
her
for
his
brother's
widow
and
that
till
it
was
in
his
power
to
pay
his
compliments
to
her
in
person
lorenzo
was
commissioned
to
supply
his
place
this
intelligence
relieved
elvira
from
an
heavy
weight
of
uneasiness
she
had
now
found
a
protector
for
the
fatherless
antonia
for
whose
future
fortunes
she
had
suffered
the
greatest
apprehensions
she
was
not
sparing
of
her
thanks
to
him
who
had
interfered
so
generously
in
her
behalf
but
still
she
gave
him
no
invitation
to
repeat
his
visit
however
when
upon
rising
to
depart
he
requested
permission
to
enquire
after
her
health
occasionally
the
polite
earnestness
of
his
manner
gratitude
for
his
services
and
respect
for
his
friend
the
marquis
would
not
admit
of
a
refusal
she
consented
reluctantly
to
receive
him
he
promised
not
to
abuse
her
goodness
and
quitted
the
house
antonia
was
now
left
alone
with
her
mother
a
temporary
silence
ensued
both
wished
to
speak
upon
the
same
subject
but
neither
knew
how
to
introduce
it
the
one
felt
a
bashfulness
which
sealed
up
her
lips
and
for
which
she
could
not
account
the
other
feared
to
find
her
apprehensions
true
or
to
inspire
her
daughter
with
notions
to
which
she
might
be
still
a
stranger
at
length
elvira
began
the
conversation
'that
is
a
charming
young
man
antonia
i
am
much
pleased
with
him
was
he
long
near
you
yesterday
in
the
cathedral'
'he
quitted
me
not
for
a
moment
while
i
staid
in
the
church
he
gave
me
his
seat
and
was
very
obliging
and
attentive'
'indeed
why
then
have
you
never
mentioned
his
name
to
me
your
aunt
lanched
out
in
praise
of
his
friend
and
you
vaunted
ambrosio's
eloquence
but
neither
said
a
word
of
don
lorenzo's
person
and
accomplishments
had
not
leonella
spoken
of
his
readiness
to
undertake
our
cause
i
should
not
have
known
him
to
be
in
existence'
she
paused
antonia
coloured
but
was
silent
'perhaps
you
judge
him
less
favourably
than
i
do
in
my
opinion
his
figure
is
pleasing
his
conversation
sensible
and
manners
engaging
still
he
may
have
struck
you
differently
you
may
think
him
disagreeable
and
'
'disagreeable
oh
dear
mother
how
should
i
possibly
think
him
so
i
should
be
very
ungrateful
were
i
not
sensible
of
his
kindness
yesterday
and
very
blind
if
his
merits
had
escaped
me
his
figure
is
so
graceful
so
noble
his
manners
so
gentle
yet
so
manly
i
never
yet
saw
so
many
accomplishments
united
in
one
person
and
i
doubt
whether
madrid
can
produce
his
equal'
'why
then
were
you
so
silent
in
praise
of
this
phoenix
of
madrid
why
was
it
concealed
from
me
that
his
society
had
afforded
you
pleasure'
'in
truth
i
know
not
you
ask
me
a
question
which
i
cannot
resolve
myself
i
was
on
the
point
of
mentioning
him
a
thousand
times
his
name
was
constantly
upon
my
lips
but
when
i
would
have
pronounced
it
i
wanted
courage
to
execute
my
design
however
if
i
did
not
speak
of
him
it
was
not
that
i
thought
of
him
the
less'
'that
i
believe
but
shall
i
tell
you
why
you
wanted
courage
it
was
because
accustomed
to
confide
to
me
your
most
secret
thoughts
you
knew
not
how
to
conceal
yet
feared
to
acknowledge
that
your
heart
nourished
a
sentiment
which
you
were
conscious
i
should
disapprove
come
hither
to
me
my
child'
antonia
quitted
her
embroidery
frame
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
by
the
sopha
and
hid
her
face
in
her
mother's
lap
'fear
not
my
sweet
girl
consider
me
equally
as
your
friend
and
parent
and
apprehend
no
reproof
from
me
i
have
read
the
emotions
of
your
bosom
you
are
yet
ill-skilled
in
concealing
them
and
they
could
not
escape
my
attentive
eye
this
lorenzo
is
dangerous
to
your
repose
he
has
already
made
an
impression
upon
your
heart
'tis
true
that
i
perceive
easily
that
your
affection
is
returned
but
what
can
be
the
consequences
of
this
attachment
you
are
poor
and
friendless
my
antonia
lorenzo
is
the
heir
of
the
duke
of
medina
celi
even
should
himself
mean
honourably
his
uncle
never
will
consent
to
your
union
nor
without
that
uncle's
consent
will
i
by
sad
experience
i
know
what
sorrows
she
must
endure
who
marries
into
a
family
unwilling
to
receive
her
then
struggle
with
your
affection
whatever
pains
it
may
cost
you
strive
to
conquer
it
your
heart
is
tender
and
susceptible
it
has
already
received
a
strong
impression
but
when
once
convinced
that
you
should
not
encourage
such
sentiments
i
trust
that
you
have
sufficient
fortitude
to
drive
them
from
your
bosom'
antonia
kissed
her
hand
and
promised
implicit
obedience
elvira
then
continued
'to
prevent
your
passion
from
growing
stronger
it
will
be
needful
to
prohibit
lorenzo's
visits
the
service
which
he
has
rendered
me
permits
not
my
forbidding
them
positively
but
unless
i
judge
too
favourably
of
his
character
he
will
discontinue
them
without
taking
offence
if
i
confess
to
him
my
reasons
and
throw
myself
entirely
on
his
generosity
the
next
time
that
i
see
him
i
will
honestly
avow
to
him
the
embarrassment
which
his
presence
occasions
how
say
you
my
child
is
not
this
measure
necessary'
antonia
subscribed
to
every
thing
without
hesitation
though
not
without
regret
her
mother
kissed
her
affectionately
and
retired
to
bed
antonia
followed
her
example
and
vowed
so
frequently
never
more
to
think
of
lorenzo
that
till
sleep
closed
her
eyes
she
thought
of
nothing
else
while
this
was
passing
at
elvira's
lorenzo
hastened
to
rejoin
the
marquis
every
thing
was
ready
for
the
second
elopement
of
agnes
and
at
twelve
the
two
friends
with
a
coach
and
four
were
at
the
garden
wall
of
the
convent
don
raymond
drew
out
his
key
and
unlocked
the
door
they
entered
and
waited
for
some
time
in
expectation
of
being
joined
by
agnes
at
length
the
marquis
grew
impatient
beginning
to
fear
that
his
second
attempt
would
succeed
no
better
than
the
first
he
proposed
to
reconnoitre
the
convent
the
friends
advanced
towards
it
every
thing
was
still
and
dark
the
prioress
was
anxious
to
keep
the
story
a
secret
fearing
lest
the
crime
of
one
of
its
members
should
bring
disgrace
upon
the
whole
community
or
that
the
interposition
of
powerful
relations
should
deprive
her
vengeance
of
its
intended
victim
she
took
care
therefore
to
give
the
lover
of
agnes
no
cause
to
suppose
that
his
design
was
discovered
and
his
mistress
on
the
point
of
suffering
the
punishment
of
her
fault
the
same
reason
made
her
reject
the
idea
of
arresting
the
unknown
seducer
in
the
garden
such
a
proceeding
would
have
created
much
disturbance
and
the
disgrace
of
her
convent
would
have
been
noised
about
madrid
she
contented
herself
with
confining
agnes
closely
as
to
the
lover
she
left
him
at
liberty
to
pursue
his
designs
what
she
had
expected
was
the
result
the
marquis
and
lorenzo
waited
in
vain
till
the
break
of
day
they
then
retired
without
noise
alarmed
at
the
failure
of
their
plan
and
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
its
ill-success
the
next
morning
lorenzo
went
to
the
convent
and
requested
to
see
his
sister
the
prioress
appeared
at
the
grate
with
a
melancholy
countenance
she
informed
him
that
for
several
days
agnes
had
appeared
much
agitated
that
she
had
been
prest
by
the
nuns
in
vain
to
reveal
the
cause
and
apply
to
their
tenderness
for
advice
and
consolation
that
she
had
obstinately
persisted
in
concealing
the
cause
of
her
distress
but
that
on
thursday
evening
it
had
produced
so
violent
an
effect
upon
her
constitution
that
she
had
fallen
ill
and
was
actually
confined
to
her
bed
lorenzo
did
not
credit
a
syllable
of
this
account
he
insisted
upon
seeing
his
sister
if
she
was
unable
to
come
to
the
grate
he
desired
to
be
admitted
to
her
cell
the
prioress
crossed
herself
she
was
shocked
at
the
very
idea
of
a
man's
profane
eye
pervading
the
interior
of
her
holy
mansion
and
professed
herself
astonished
that
lorenzo
could
think
of
such
a
thing
she
told
him
that
his
request
could
not
be
granted
but
that
if
he
returned
the
next
day
she
hoped
that
her
beloved
daughter
would
then
be
sufficiently
recovered
to
join
him
at
the
parlour
grate
with
this
answer
lorenzo
was
obliged
to
retire
unsatisfied
and
trembling
for
his
sister's
safety
he
returned
the
next
morning
at
an
early
hour
'agnes
was
worse
the
physician
had
pronounced
her
to
be
in
imminent
danger
she
was
ordered
to
remain
quiet
and
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
her
to
receive
her
brother's
visit'
lorenzo
stormed
at
this
answer
but
there
was
no
resource
he
raved
he
entreated
he
threatened
no
means
were
left
untried
to
obtain
a
sight
of
agnes
his
endeavours
were
as
fruitless
as
those
of
the
day
before
and
he
returned
in
despair
to
the
marquis
on
his
side
the
latter
had
spared
no
pains
to
discover
what
had
occasioned
his
plot
to
fail
don
christoval
to
whom
the
affair
was
now
entrusted
endeavoured
to
worm
out
the
secret
from
the
old
porteress
of
st
clare
with
whom
he
had
formed
an
acquaintance
but
she
was
too
much
upon
her
guard
and
he
gained
from
her
no
intelligence
the
marquis
was
almost
distracted
and
lorenzo
felt
scarcely
less
inquietude
both
were
convinced
that
the
purposed
elopement
must
have
been
discovered
they
doubted
not
but
the
malady
of
agnes
was
a
pretence
but
they
knew
not
by
what
means
to
rescue
her
from
the
hands
of
the
prioress
regularly
every
day
did
lorenzo
visit
the
convent
as
regularly
was
he
informed
that
his
sister
rather
grew
worse
than
better
certain
that
her
indisposition
was
feigned
these
accounts
did
not
alarm
him
but
his
ignorance
of
her
fate
and
of
the
motives
which
induced
the
prioress
to
keep
her
from
him
excited
the
most
serious
uneasiness
he
was
still
uncertain
what
steps
he
ought
to
take
when
the
marquis
received
a
letter
from
the
cardinal-duke
of
lerma
it
inclosed
the
pope's
expected
bull
ordering
that
agnes
should
be
released
from
her
vows
and
restored
to
her
relations
this
essential
paper
decided
at
once
the
proceedings
of
her
friends
they
resolved
that
lorenzo
should
carry
it
to
the
domina
without
delay
and
demand
that
his
sister
should
be
instantly
given
up
to
him
against
this
mandate
illness
could
not
be
pleaded
it
gave
her
brother
the
power
of
removing
her
instantly
to
the
palace
de
medina
and
he
determined
to
use
that
power
on
the
following
day
his
mind
relieved
from
inquietude
respecting
his
sister
and
his
spirits
raised
by
the
hope
of
soon
restoring
her
to
freedom
he
now
had
time
to
give
a
few
moments
to
love
and
to
antonia
at
the
same
hour
as
on
his
former
visit
he
repaired
to
donna
elvira's
she
had
given
orders
for
his
admission
as
soon
as
he
was
announced
her
daughter
retired
with
leonella
and
when
he
entered
the
chamber
he
found
the
lady
of
the
house
alone
she
received
him
with
less
distance
than
before
and
desired
him
to
place
himself
near
her
upon
the
sopha
she
then
without
losing
time
opened
her
business
as
had
been
agreed
between
herself
and
antonia
'you
must
not
think
me
ungrateful
don
lorenzo
or
forgetful
how
essential
are
the
services
which
you
have
rendered
me
with
the
marquis
i
feel
the
weight
of
my
obligations
nothing
under
the
sun
should
induce
my
taking
the
step
to
which
i
am
now
compelled
but
the
interest
of
my
child
of
my
beloved
antonia
my
health
is
declining
god
only
knows
how
soon
i
may
be
summoned
before
his
throne
my
daughter
will
be
left
without
parents
and
should
she
lose
the
protection
of
the
cisternas
family
without
friends
she
is
young
and
artless
uninstructed
in
the
world's
perfidy
and
with
charms
sufficient
to
render
her
an
object
of
seduction
judge
then
how
i
must
tremble
at
the
prospect
before
her
judge
how
anxious
i
must
be
to
keep
her
from
their
society
who
may
excite
the
yet
dormant
passions
of
her
bosom
you
are
amiable
don
lorenzo
antonia
has
a
susceptible
a
loving
heart
and
is
grateful
for
the
favours
conferred
upon
us
by
your
interference
with
the
marquis
your
presence
makes
me
tremble
i
fear
lest
it
should
inspire
her
with
sentiments
which
may
embitter
the
remainder
of
her
life
or
encourage
her
to
cherish
hopes
in
her
situation
unjustifiable
and
futile
pardon
me
when
i
avow
my
terrors
and
let
my
frankness
plead
in
my
excuse
i
cannot
forbid
you
my
house
for
gratitude
restrains
me
i
can
only
throw
myself
upon
your
generosity
and
entreat
you
to
spare
the
feelings
of
an
anxious
of
a
doting
mother
believe
me
when
i
assure
you
that
i
lament
the
necessity
of
rejecting
your
acquaintance
but
there
is
no
remedy
and
antonia's
interest
obliges
me
to
beg
you
to
forbear
your
visits
by
complying
with
my
request
you
will
increase
the
esteem
which
i
already
feel
for
you
and
of
which
everything
convinces
me
that
you
are
truly
deserving'
'your
frankness
charms
me'
replied
lorenzo
'you
shall
find
that
in
your
favourable
opinion
of
me
you
were
not
deceived
yet
i
hope
that
the
reasons
now
in
my
power
to
allege
will
persuade
you
to
withdraw
a
request
which
i
cannot
obey
without
infinite
reluctance
i
love
your
daughter
love
her
most
sincerely
i
wish
for
no
greater
happiness
than
to
inspire
her
with
the
same
sentiments
and
receive
her
hand
at
the
altar
as
her
husband
'tis
true
i
am
not
rich
myself
my
father's
death
has
left
me
but
little
in
my
own
possession
but
my
expectations
justify
my
pretending
to
the
conde
de
las
cisternas'
daughter'
he
was
proceeding
but
elvira
interrupted
him
'ah
don
lorenzo
you
forget
in
that
pompous
title
the
meanness
of
my
origin
you
forget
that
i
have
now
past
fourteen
years
in
spain
disavowed
by
my
husband's
family
and
existing
upon
a
stipend
barely
sufficient
for
the
support
and
education
of
my
daughter
nay
i
have
even
been
neglected
by
most
of
my
own
relations
who
out
of
envy
affect
to
doubt
the
reality
of
my
marriage
my
allowance
being
discontinued
at
my
father-in-law's
death
i
was
reduced
to
the
very
brink
of
want
in
this
situation
i
was
found
by
my
sister
who
amongst
all
her
foibles
possesses
a
warm
generous
and
affectionate
heart
she
aided
me
with
the
little
fortune
which
my
father
left
her
persuaded
me
to
visit
madrid
and
has
supported
my
child
and
myself
since
our
quitting
murcia
then
consider
not
antonia
as
descended
from
the
conde
de
la
cisternas
consider
her
as
a
poor
and
unprotected
orphan
as
the
grand-child
of
the
tradesman
torribio
dalfa
as
the
needy
pensioner
of
that
tradesman's
daughter
reflect
upon
the
difference
between
such
a
situation
and
that
of
the
nephew
and
heir
of
the
potent
duke
of
medina
i
believe
your
intentions
to
be
honourable
but
as
there
are
no
hopes
that
your
uncle
will
approve
of
the
union
i
foresee
that
the
consequences
of
your
attachment
must
be
fatal
to
my
child's
repose'
'pardon
me
segnora
you
are
misinformed
if
you
suppose
the
duke
of
medina
to
resemble
the
generality
of
men
his
sentiments
are
liberal
and
disinterested
he
loves
me
well
and
i
have
no
reason
to
dread
his
forbidding
the
marriage
when
he
perceives
that
my
happiness
depends
upon
antonia
but
supposing
him
to
refuse
his
sanction
what
have
i
still
to
fear
my
parents
are
no
more
my
little
fortune
is
in
my
own
possession
it
will
be
sufficient
to
support
antonia
and
i
shall
exchange
for
her
hand
medina's
dukedom
without
one
sigh
of
regret'
'you
are
young
and
eager
it
is
natural
for
you
to
entertain
such
ideas
but
experience
has
taught
me
to
my
cost
that
curses
accompany
an
unequal
alliance
i
married
the
conde
de
las
cisternas
in
opposition
to
the
will
of
his
relations
many
an
heart-pang
has
punished
me
for
the
imprudent
step
whereever
we
bent
our
course
a
father's
execration
pursued
gonzalvo
poverty
overtook
us
and
no
friend
was
near
to
relieve
our
wants
still
our
mutual
affection
existed
but
alas
not
without
interruption
accustomed
to
wealth
and
ease
ill
could
my
husband
support
the
transition
to
distress
and
indigence
he
looked
back
with
repining
to
the
comforts
which
he
once
enjoyed
he
regretted
the
situation
which
for
my
sake
he
had
quitted
and
in
moments
when
despair
possessed
his
mind
has
reproached
me
with
having
made
him
the
companion
of
want
and
wretchedness
he
has
called
me
his
bane
the
source
of
his
sorrows
the
cause
of
his
destruction
ah
god
he
little
knew
how
much
keener
were
my
own
heart's
reproaches
he
was
ignorant
that
i
suffered
trebly
for
myself
for
my
children
and
for
him
'tis
true
that
his
anger
seldom
lasted
long
his
sincere
affection
for
me
soon
revived
in
his
heart
and
then
his
repentance
for
the
tears
which
he
had
made
me
shed
tortured
me
even
more
than
his
reproaches
he
would
throw
himself
on
the
ground
implore
my
forgiveness
in
the
most
frantic
terms
and
load
himself
with
curses
for
being
the
murderer
of
my
repose
taught
by
experience
that
an
union
contracted
against
the
inclinations
of
families
on
either
side
must
be
unfortunate
i
will
save
my
daughter
from
those
miseries
which
i
have
suffered
without
your
uncle's
consent
while
i
live
she
never
shall
be
yours
undoubtedly
he
will
disapprove
of
the
union
his
power
is
immense
and
antonia
shall
not
be
exposed
to
his
anger
and
persecution'
'his
persecution
how
easily
may
that
be
avoided
let
the
worst
happen
it
is
but
quitting
spain
my
wealth
may
easily
be
realised
the
indian
islands
will
offer
us
a
secure
retreat
i
have
an
estate
though
not
of
value
in
hispaniola
thither
will
we
fly
and
i
shall
consider
it
to
be
my
native
country
if
it
gives
me
antonia's
undisturbed
possession'
'ah
youth
this
is
a
fond
romantic
vision
gonzalvo
thought
the
same
he
fancied
that
he
could
leave
spain
without
regret
but
the
moment
of
parting
undeceived
him
you
know
not
yet
what
it
is
to
quit
your
native
land
to
quit
it
never
to
behold
it
more
you
know
not
what
it
is
to
exchange
the
scenes
where
you
have
passed
your
infancy
for
unknown
realms
and
barbarous
climates
to
be
forgotten
utterly
eternally
forgotten
by
the
companions
of
your
youth
to
see
your
dearest
friends
the
fondest
objects
of
your
affection
perishing
with
diseases
incidental
to
indian
atmospheres
and
find
yourself
unable
to
procure
for
them
necessary
assistance
i
have
felt
all
this
my
husband
and
two
sweet
babes
found
their
graves
in
cuba
nothing
would
have
saved
my
young
antonia
but
my
sudden
return
to
spain
ah
don
lorenzo
could
you
conceive
what
i
suffered
during
my
absence
could
you
know
how
sorely
i
regretted
all
that
i
left
behind
and
how
dear
to
me
was
the
very
name
of
spain
i
envied
the
winds
which
blew
towards
it
and
when
the
spanish
sailor
chaunted
some
well-known
air
as
he
past
my
window
tears
filled
my
eyes
while
i
thought
upon
my
native
land
gonzalvo
too

my
husband
'
elvira
paused
her
voice
faltered
and
she
concealed
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
after
a
short
silence
she
rose
from
the
sopha
and
proceeded
'excuse
my
quitting
you
for
a
few
moments
the
remembrance
of
what
i
have
suffered
has
much
agitated
me
and
i
need
to
be
alone
till
i
return
peruse
these
lines
after
my
husband's
death
i
found
them
among
his
papers
had
i
known
sooner
that
he
entertained
such
sentiments
grief
would
have
killed
me
he
wrote
these
verses
on
his
voyage
to
cuba
when
his
mind
was
clouded
by
sorrow
and
he
forgot
that
he
had
a
wife
and
children
what
we
are
losing
ever
seems
to
us
the
most
precious
gonzalvo
was
quitting
spain
for
ever
and
therefore
was
spain
dearer
to
his
eyes
than
all
else
which
the
world
contained
read
them
don
lorenzo
they
will
give
you
some
idea
of
the
feelings
of
a
banished
man'
elvira
put
a
paper
into
lorenzo's
hand
and
retired
from
the
chamber
the
youth
examined
the
contents
and
found
them
to
be
as
follows
the
exile
farewell
oh
native
spain
farewell
for
ever
these
banished
eyes
shall
view
thy
coasts
no
more
a
mournful
presage
tells
my
heart
that
never
gonzalvo's
steps
again
shall
press
thy
shore
hushed
are
the
winds
while
soft
the
vessel
sailing
with
gentle
motion
plows
the
unruffled
main
i
feel
my
bosom's
boasted
courage
failing
and
curse
the
waves
which
bear
me
far
from
spain
i
see
it
yet
beneath
yon
blue
clear
heaven
still
do
the
spires
so
well
beloved
appear
from
yonder
craggy
point
the
gale
of
even
still
wafts
my
native
accents
to
mine
ear
propped
on
some
moss-crowned
rock
and
gaily
singing
there
in
the
sun
his
nets
the
fisher
dries
oft
have
i
heard
the
plaintive
ballad
bringing
scenes
of
past
joys
before
my
sorrowing
eyes
ah
happy
swain
he
waits
the
accustomed
hour
when
twilight-gloom
obscures
the
closing
sky
then
gladly
seeks
his
loved
paternal
bower
and
shares
the
feast
his
native
fields
supply
friendship
and
love
his
cottage
guests
receive
him
with
honest
welcome
and
with
smile
sincere
no
threatening
woes
of
present
joys
bereave
him
no
sigh
his
bosom
owns
his
cheek
no
tear
ah
happy
swain
such
bliss
to
me
denying
fortune
thy
lot
with
envy
bids
me
view
me
who
from
home
and
spain
an
exile
flying
bid
all
i
value
all
i
love
adieu
no
more
mine
ear
shall
list
the
well-known
ditty
sung
by
some
mountain-girl
who
tends
her
goats
some
village-swain
imploring
amorous
pity
or
shepherd
chaunting
wild
his
rustic
notes
no
more
my
arms
a
parent's
fond
embraces
no
more
my
heart
domestic
calm
must
know
far
from
these
joys
with
sighs
which
memory
traces
to
sultry
skies
and
distant
climes
i
go
where
indian
suns
engender
new
diseases
where
snakes
and
tigers
breed
i
bend
my
way
to
brave
the
feverish
thirst
no
art
appeases
the
yellow
plague
and
madding
blaze
of
day
but
not
to
feel
slow
pangs
consume
my
liver
to
die
by
piece-meal
in
the
bloom
of
age
my
boiling
blood
drank
by
insatiate
fever
and
brain
delirious
with
the
day-star's
rage
can
make
me
know
such
grief
as
thus
to
sever
with
many
a
bitter
sigh
dear
land
from
thee
to
feel
this
heart
must
doat
on
thee
for
ever
and
feel
that
all
thy
joys
are
torn
from
me
ah
me
how
oft
will
fancy's
spells
in
slumber
recall
my
native
country
to
my
mind
how
oft
regret
will
bid
me
sadly
number
each
lost
delight
and
dear
friend
left
behind
wild
murcia's
vales
and
loved
romantic
bowers
the
river
on
whose
banks
a
child
i
played
my
castle's
antient
halls
its
frowning
towers
each
much-regretted
wood
and
well-known
glade
dreams
of
the
land
where
all
my
wishes
centre
thy
scenes
which
i
am
doomed
no

to
know
full
oft

memory
trace
my
soul's
tormentor

turn
each
pleasure
past
to
present
woe

lo
the
sun
beneath
the
waves
retires
night
speeds
apace
her
empire
to
restore
clouds
from
my
sight
obscure
the
village-spires
now
seen
but
faintly
and
now
seen
no
more

breathe
not

the
water's
motion

sleep
my
bark
in
silence
on
the
main
so
when
to-morrow's
light
shall
gild
the
ocean
once
more
mine
eyes
shall
see
the
coast
of
spain

the
wish

last
petition
scorning
fresh
blows
the
gale
and
high
the
billows
swell
far

we
be
before

break
of
morning
oh
then
for

scarcely
time
to

these
lines

elvira
returned
to
him
the
giving
a
free
course
to
her
tears
had
relieved
her
and
her
spirits
had
regained
their
usual
composure
'i
have
nothing
more
to

my
lord'
said
she
'you
have
heard
my
apprehensions
and
my
reasons
for
begging
you
not
to
repeat
your
visits
i
have
thrown
myself
in
full
confidence
upon

i
fear
that
it
is
desired
but
too
ardently
by
my
daughter
you
have
made
an
impression
upon
her
young
heart
which
gives
me
the
most
serious
alarm
to
prevent
that
impression
from
growing
stronger
i
am
obliged
to
decline
your
acquaintance
for
me
you
may
be
sure
that
i
should
rejoice
at
establishing
my
child
so
advantageously
conscious
that
my
constitution
impaired
by
grief
and
illness
forbids
me
to
expect
a
long
continuance

the
protection
of
a
perfect
stranger

eye
of
displeasure

deprive
her
of
her
only

the

prepossession
if
the
sanction
of
your
relations
authorises
your
addressing
her
as
your
wife
my
doors
fly
open
to
you
if
that
sanction
is
refused
be
satisfied
to
possess
my
esteem
and
gratitude
but
remember
that
we
must
meet
no
more'
lorenzo
promised
reluctantly
to
conform
to
this
decree
but
he
added
that
he
hoped
soon
to
obtain
that
consent
which
would
give
him
a
claim
to
the
renewal
of
their
acquaintance
he
then
explained
to
her
why
the
marquis
had
not
called
in
person
and
made
no
scruple
of
confiding
to
her
his
sister's
history
he
concluded
by
saying
that
he
hoped
to
set
agnes
at
liberty
the
next
day
and
that
as
soon
as
don
raymond's
fears
were
quieted
upon
this
subject
he
would
lose
no
time
in
assuring
donna
elvira
of
his
friendship
and
protection
the
lady
shook
her
head
'i
tremble
for
your
sister'
said
she
'i
have
heard
many
traits
of
the
domina
of
st
clare's
character
from
a
friend
who
was
educated
in
the
same
convent
with
her
she
reported
her
to
be
haughty
inflexible
superstitious
and
revengeful
i
have
since
heard
that
she
is
infatuated
with
the
idea
of
rendering
her
convent
the
most
regular
in
madrid
and
never
forgave
those
whose
imprudence
threw
upon
it
the
slightest
stain
though
naturally
violent
and
severe
when
her
interests
require
it
she
well
knows
how
to
assume
an
appearance
of
benignity
she
leaves
no
means
untried
to
persuade
young
women
of
rank
to
become
members
of
her
community
she
is
implacable
when
once
incensed
and
has
too
much
intrepidity
to
shrink
at
taking
the
most
rigorous
measures
for
punishing
the
offender
doubtless
she
will
consider
your
sister's
quitting
the
convent
as
a
disgrace
thrown
upon
it
she
will
use
every
artifice
to
avoid
obeying
the
mandate
of
his
holiness
and
i
shudder
to
think
that
donna
agnes
is
in
the
hands
of
this
dangerous
woman'
lorenzo
now
rose
to
take
leave
elvira
gave
him
her
hand
at
parting
which
he
kissed
respectfully
and
telling
her
that
he
soon
hoped
for
the
permission
to
salute
that
of
antonia
he
returned
to
his
hotel
the
lady
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
conversation
which
had
past
between
them
she
looked
forward
with
satisfaction
to
the
prospect
of
his
becoming
her
son-in-law
but
prudence
bad
her
conceal
from
her
daughter's
knowledge
the
flattering
hopes
which
herself
now
ventured
to
entertain
scarcely
was
it
day
and
already
lorenzo
was
at
the
convent
of
st
clare
furnished
with
the
necessary
mandate
the
nuns
were
at
matins
he
waited
impatiently
for
the
conclusion
of
the
service
and
at
length
the
prioress
appeared
at
the
parlour
grate
agnes
was
demanded
the
old
lady
replied
with
a
melancholy
air
that
the
dear
child's
situation
grew
hourly
more
dangerous
that
the
physicians
despaired
of
her
life
but
that
they
had
declared
the
only
chance
for
her
recovery
to
consist
in
keeping
her
quiet
and
not
to
permit
those
to
approach
her
whose
presence
was
likely
to
agitate
her
not
a
word
of
all
this
was
believed
by
lorenzo
any
more
than
he
credited
the
expressions
of
grief
and
affection
for
agnes
with
which
this
account
was
interlarded
to
end
the
business
he
put
the
pope's
bull
into
the
hands
of
the
domina
and
insisted
that
ill
or
in
health
his
sister
should
be
delivered
to
him
without
delay
the
prioress
received
the
paper
with
an
air
of
humility
but
no
sooner
had
her
eye
glanced
over
the
contents
than
her
resentment
baffled
all
the
efforts
of
hypocrisy
a
deep
crimson
spread
itself
over
her
face
and
she
darted
upon
lorenzo
looks
of
rage
and
menace
'this
order
is
positive'
said
she
in
a
voice
of
anger
which
she
in
vain
strove
to
disguise
'willingly
would
i
obey
it
but
unfortunately
it
is
out
of
my
power'
lorenzo
interrupted
her
by
an
exclamation
of
surprize
'i
repeat
it
segnor
to
obey
this
order
is
totally
out
of
my
power
from
tenderness
to
a
brother's
feelings
i
would
have
communicated
the
sad
event
to
you
by
degrees
and
have
prepared
you
to
hear
it
with
fortitude
my
measures
are
broken
through
this
order
commands
me
to
deliver
up
to
you
the
sister
agnes
without
delay
i
am
therefore
obliged
to
inform
you
without
circumlocution
that
on
friday
last
she
expired'
lorenzo
started
back
with
horror
and
turned
pale
a
moment's
recollection
convinced
him
that
this
assertion
must
be
false
and
it
restored
him
to
himself
'you
deceive
me'
said
he
passionately
'but
five
minutes
past
since
you
assured
me
that
though
ill
she
was
still
alive
produce
her
this
instant
see
her
i
must
and
will
and
every
attempt
to
keep
her
from
me
will
be
unavailing'
'you
forget
yourself
segnor
you
owe
respect
to
my
age
as
well
as
my
profession
your
sister
is
no
more
if
i
at
first
concealed
her
death
it
was
from
dreading
lest
an
event
so
unexpected
should
produce
on
you
too
violent
an
effect
in
truth
i
am
but
ill
repaid
for
my
attention
and
what
interest
i
pray
you
should
i
have
in
detaining
her
to
know
her
wish
of
quitting
our
society
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
me
to
wish
her
absence
and
think
her
a
disgrace
to
the
sisterhood
of
st
clare
but
she
has
forfeited
my
affection
in
a
manner
yet
more
culpable
her
crimes
were
great
and
when
you
know
the
cause
of
her
death
you
will
doubtless
rejoice
don
lorenzo
that
such
a
wretch
is
no
longer
in
existence
she
was
taken
ill
on
thursday
last
on
returning
from
confession
in
the
capuchin
chapel
her
malady
seemed
attended
with
strange
circumstances
but
she
persisted
in
concealing
its
cause
thanks
to
the
virgin
we
were
too
ignorant
to
suspect
it
judge
then
what
must
have
been
our
consternation
our
horror
when
she
was
delivered
the
next
day
of
a
stillborn
child
whom
she
immediately
followed
to
the
grave
how
segnor
is
it
possible
that
your
countenance
expresses
no
surprize
no
indignation
is
it
possible
that
your
sister's
infamy
was
known
to
you
and
that
still
she
possessed
your
affection
in
that
case
you
have
no
need
of
my
compassion
i
can
say
nothing
more
except
repeat
my
inability
of
obeying
the
orders
of
his
holiness
agnes
is
no
more
and
to
convince
you
that
what
i
say
is
true
i
swear
by
our
blessed
saviour
that
three
days
have
past
since
she
was
buried'
here
she
kissed
a
small
crucifix
which
hung
at
her
girdle
she
then
rose
from
her
chair
and
quitted
the
parlour
as
she
withdrew
she
cast
upon
lorenzo
a
scornful
smile
'farewell
segnor'
said
she
'i
know
no
remedy
for
this
accident
i
fear
that
even
a
second
bull
from
the
pope
will
not
procure
your
sister's
resurrection'
lorenzo
also
retired
penetrated
with
affliction
but
don
raymond's
at
the
news
of
this
event
amounted
to
madness
he
would
not
be
convinced
that
agnes
was
really
dead
and
continued
to
insist
that
the
walls
of
st
clare
still
confined
her
no
arguments
could
make
him
abandon
his
hopes
of
regaining
her
every
day
some
fresh
scheme
was
invented
for
procuring
intelligence
of
her
and
all
of
them
were
attended
with
the
same
success
on
his
part
medina
gave
up
the
idea
of
ever
seeing
his
sister
more
yet
he
believed
that
she
had
been
taken
off
by
unfair
means
under
this
persuasion
he
encouraged
don
raymond's
researches
determined
should
he
discover
the
least
warrant
for
his
suspicions
to
take
a
severe
vengeance
upon
the
unfeeling
prioress
the
loss
of
his
sister
affected
him
sincerely
nor
was
it
the
least
cause
of
his
distress
that
propriety
obliged
him
for
some
time
to
defer
mentioning
antonia
to
the
duke
in
the
meanwhile
his
emissaries
constantly
surrounded
elvira's
door
he
had
intelligence
of
all
the
movements
of
his
mistress
as
she
never
failed
every
thursday
to
attend
the
sermon
in
the
capuchin
cathedral
he
was
secure
of
seeing
her
once
a
week
though
in
compliance
with
his
promise
he
carefully
shunned
her
observation
thus
two
long
months
passed
away
still
no
information
was
procured
of
agnes
all
but
the
marquis
credited
her
death
and
now
lorenzo
determined
to
disclose
his
sentiments
to
his
uncle
he
had
already
dropt
some
hints
of
his
intention
to
marry
they
had
been
as
favourably
received
as
he
could
expect
and
he
harboured
no
doubt
of
the
success
of
his
application
while
in
each
other's
arms
entranced
they
lay
they
blessed
the
night
and
curst
the
coming
day
lee
the
burst
of
transport
was
past
ambrosio's
lust
was
satisfied
pleasure
fled
and
shame
usurped
her
seat
in
his
bosom
confused
and
terrified
at
his
weakness
he
drew
himself
from
matilda's
arms
his
perjury
presented
itself
before
him
he
reflected
on
the
scene
which
had
just
been
acted
and
trembled
at
the
consequences
of
a
discovery
he
looked
forward
with
horror
his
heart
was
despondent
and
became
the
abode
of
satiety
and
disgust
he
avoided
the
eyes
of
his
partner
in
frailty
a
melancholy
silence
prevailed
during
which
both
seemed
busied
with
disagreeable
reflections
matilda
was
the
first
to
break
it
she
took
his
hand
gently
and
pressed
it
to
her
burning
lips
'ambrosio'
she
murmured
in
a
soft
and
trembling
voice
the
abbot
started
at
the
sound
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
matilda's
they
were
filled
with
tears
her
cheeks
were
covered
with
blushes
and
her
supplicating
looks
seemed
to
solicit
his
compassion
'dangerous
woman'
said
he
'into
what
an
abyss
of
misery
have
you
plunged
me
should
your
sex
be
discovered
my
honour
nay
my
life
must
pay
for
the
pleasure
of
a
few
moments
fool
that
i
was
to
trust
myself
to
your
seductions
what
can
now
be
done
how
can
my
offence
be
expiated
what
atonement
can
purchase
the
pardon
of
my
crime
wretched
matilda
you
have
destroyed
my
quiet
for
ever'
'to
me
these
reproaches
ambrosio
to
me
who
have
sacrificed
for
you
the
world's
pleasures
the
luxury
of
wealth
the
delicacy
of
sex
my
friends
my
fortune
and
my
fame
what
have
you
lost
which
i
preserved
have
i
not
shared
in
your
guilt
have
you
not
shared
in
my
pleasure
guilt
did
i
say
in
what
consists
ours
unless
in
the
opinion
of
an
ill-judging
world
let
that
world
be
ignorant
of
them
and
our
joys
become
divine
and
blameless
unnatural
were
your
vows
of
celibacy
man
was
not
created
for
such
a
state
and
were
love
a
crime
god
never
would
have
made
it
so
sweet
so
irresistible
then
banish
those
clouds
from
your
brow
my
ambrosio
indulge
in
those
pleasures
freely
without
which
life
is
a
worthless
gift
cease
to
reproach
me
with
having
taught
you
what
is
bliss
and
feel
equal
transports
with
the
woman
who
adores
you'
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
were
filled
with
a
delicious
languor
her
bosom
panted
she
twined
her
arms
voluptuously
round
him
drew
him
towards
her
and
glewed
her
lips
to
his
ambrosio
again
raged
with
desire
the
die
was
thrown
his
vows
were
already
broken
he
had
already
committed
the
crime
and
why
should
he
refrain
from
enjoying
its
reward
he
clasped
her
to
his
breast
with
redoubled
ardour
no
longer
repressed
by
the
sense
of
shame
he
gave
a
loose
to
his
intemperate
appetites
while
the
fair
wanton
put
every
invention
of
lust
in
practice
every
refinement
in
the
art
of
pleasure
which
might
heighten
the
bliss
of
her
possession
and
render
her
lover's
transports
still
more
exquisite
ambrosio
rioted
in
delights
till
then
unknown
to
him
swift
fled
the
night
and
the
morning
blushed
to
behold
him
still
clasped
in
the
embraces
of
matilda
intoxicated
with
pleasure
the
monk
rose
from
the
syren's
luxurious
couch
he
no
longer
reflected
with
shame
upon
his
incontinence
or
dreaded
the
vengeance
of
offended
heaven
his
only
fear
was
lest
death
should
rob
him
of
enjoyments
for
which
his
long
fast
had
only
given
a
keener
edge
to
his
appetite
matilda
was
still
under
the
influence
of
poison
and
the
voluptuous
monk
trembled
less
for
his
preserver's
life
than
his
concubine's
deprived
of
her
he
would
not
easily
find
another
mistress
with
whom
he
could
indulge
his
passions
so
fully
and
so
safely
he
therefore
pressed
her
with
earnestness
to
use
the
means
of
preservation
which
she
had
declared
to
be
in
her
possession
'yes'
replied
matilda
'since
you
have
made
me
feel
that
life
is
valuable
i
will
rescue
mine
at
any
rate
no
dangers
shall
appall
me
i
will
look
upon
the
consequences
of
my
action
boldly
nor
shudder
at
the
horrors
which
they
present
i
will
think
my
sacrifice
scarcely
worthy
to
purchase
your
possession
and
remember
that
a
moment
past
in
your
arms
in
this
world
o'er-pays
an
age
of
punishment
in
the
next
but
before
i
take
this
step
ambrosio
give
me
your
solemn
oath
never
to
enquire
by
what
means
i
shall
preserve
myself'
he
did
so
in
a
manner
the
most
binding
'i
thank
you
my
beloved
this
precaution
is
necessary
for
though
you
know
it
not
you
are
under
the
command
of
vulgar
prejudices
the
business
on
which
i
must
be
employed
this
night
might
startle
you
from
its
singularity
and
lower
me
in
your
opinion
tell
me
are
you
possessed
of
the
key
of
the
low
door
on
the
western
side
of
the
garden'
'the
door
which
opens
into
the
burying-ground
common
to
us
and
the
sisterhood
of
st
clare
i
have
not
the
key
but
can
easily
procure
it'
'you
have
only
this
to
do
admit
me
into
the
burying-ground
at
midnight
watch
while
i
descend
into
the
vaults
of
st
clare
lest
some
prying
eye
should
observe
my
actions
leave
me
there
alone
for
an
hour
and
that
life
is
safe
which
i
dedicate
to
your
pleasures
to
prevent
creating
suspicion
do
not
visit
me
during
the
day
remember
the
key
and
that
i
expect
you
before
twelve
hark
i
hear
steps
approaching
leave
me
i
will
pretend
to
sleep'
the
friar
obeyed
and
left
the
cell
as
he
opened
the
door
father
pablos
made
his
appearance
'i
come'
said
the
latter
'to
enquire
after
the
health
of
my
young
patient'
'hush'
replied
ambrosio
laying
his
finger
upon
his
lip
'speak
softly
i
am
just
come
from
him
he
has
fallen
into
a
profound
slumber
which
doubtless
will
be
of
service
to
him
do
not
disturb
him
at
present
for
he
wishes
to
repose'
father
pablos
obeyed
and
hearing
the
bell
ring
accompanied
the
abbot
to
matins
ambrosio
felt
embarrassed
as
he
entered
the
chapel
guilt
was
new
to
him
and
he
fancied
that
every
eye
could
read
the
transactions
of
the
night
upon
his
countenance
he
strove
to
pray
his
bosom
no
longer
glowed
with
devotion
his
thoughts
insensibly
wandered
to
matilda's
secret
charms
but
what
he
wanted
in
purity
of
heart
he
supplied
by
exterior
sanctity
the
better
to
cloak
his
transgression
he
redoubled
his
pretensions
to
the
semblance
of
virtue
and
never
appeared
more
devoted
to
heaven
as
since
he
had
broken
through
his
engagements
thus
did
he
unconsciously
add
hypocrisy
to
perjury
and
incontinence
he
had
fallen
into
the
latter
errors
from
yielding
to
seduction
almost
irresistible
but
he
was
now
guilty
of
a
voluntary
fault
by
endeavouring
to
conceal
those
into
which
another
had
betrayed
him
the
matins
concluded
ambrosio
retired
to
his
cell
the
pleasures
which
he
had
just
tasted
for
the
first
time
were
still
impressed
upon
his
mind
his
brain
was
bewildered
and
presented
a
confused
chaos
of
remorse
voluptuousness
inquietude
and
fear
he
looked
back
with
regret
to
that
peace
of
soul
that
security
of
virtue
which
till
then
had
been
his
portion
he
had
indulged
in
excesses
whose
very
idea
but
four
and
twenty
hours
before
he
had
recoiled
at
with
horror
he
shuddered
at
reflecting
that
a
trifling
indiscretion
on
his
part
or
on
matilda's
would
overturn
that
fabric
of
reputation
which
it
had
cost
him
thirty
years
to
erect
and
render
him
the
abhorrence
of
that
people
of
whom
he
was
then
the
idol
conscience
painted
to
him
in
glaring
colours
his
perjury
and
weakness
apprehension
magnified
to
him
the
horrors
of
punishment
and
he
already
fancied
himself
in
the
prisons
of
the
inquisition
to
these
tormenting
ideas
succeeded
matilda's
beauty
and
those
delicious
lessons
which
once
learnt
can
never
be
forgotten
a
single
glance
thrown
upon
these
reconciled
him
with
himself
he
considered
the
pleasures
of
the
former
night
to
have
been
purchased
at
an
easy
price
by
the
sacrifice
of
innocence
and
honour
their
very
remembrance
filled
his
soul
with
ecstacy
he
cursed
his
foolish
vanity
which
had
induced
him
to
waste
in
obscurity
the
bloom
of
life
ignorant
of
the
blessings
of
love
and
woman
he
determined
at
all
events
to
continue
his
commerce
with
matilda
and
called
every
argument
to
his
aid
which
might
confirm
his
resolution
he
asked
himself
provided
his
irregularity
was
unknown
in
what
would
his
fault
consist
and
what
consequences
he
had
to
apprehend
by
adhering
strictly
to
every
rule
of
his
order
save
chastity
he
doubted
not
to
retain
the
esteem
of
men
and
even
the
protection
of
heaven
he
trusted
easily
to
be
forgiven
so
slight
and
natural
a
deviation
from
his
vows
but
he
forgot
that
having
pronounced
those
vows
incontinence
in
laymen
the
most
venial
of
errors
became
in
his
person
the
most
heinous
of
crimes
once
decided
upon
his
future
conduct
his
mind
became
more
easy
he
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
and
strove
by
sleeping
to
recruit
his
strength
exhausted
by
his
nocturnal
excesses
he
awoke
refreshed
and
eager
for
a
repetition
of
his
pleasures
obedient
to
matilda's
order
he
visited
not
her
cell
during
the
day
father
pablos
mentioned
in
the
refectory
that
rosario
had
at
length
been
prevailed
upon
to
follow
his
prescription
but
that
the
medicine
had
not
produced
the
slightest
effect
and
that
he
believed
no
mortal
skill
could
rescue
him
from
the
grave
with
this
opinion
the
abbot
agreed
and
affected
to
lament
the
untimely
fate
of
a
youth
whose
talents
had
appeared
so
promising
the
night
arrived
ambrosio
had
taken
care
to
procure
from
the
porter
the
key
of
the
low
door
opening
into
the
cemetery
furnished
with
this
when
all
was
silent
in
the
monastery
he
quitted
his
cell
and
hastened
to
matilda's
she
had
left
her
bed
and
was
drest
before
his
arrival
'i
have
been
expecting
you
with
impatience'
said
she
'my
life
depends
upon
these
moments
have
you
the
key'
'i
have'
'away
then
to
the
garden
we
have
no
time
to
lose
follow
me'
she
took
a
small
covered
basket
from
the
table
bearing
this
in
one
hand
and
the
lamp
which
was
flaming
upon
the
hearth
in
the
other
she
hastened
from
the
cell
ambrosio
followed
her
both
maintained
a
profound
silence
she
moved
on
with
quick
but
cautious
steps
passed
through
the
cloisters
and
reached
the
western
side
of
the
garden
her
eyes
flashed
with
a
fire
and
wildness
which
impressed
the
monk
at
once
with
awe
and
horror
a
determined
desperate
courage
reigned
upon
her
brow
she
gave
the
lamp
to
ambrosio
then
taking
from
him
the
key
she
unlocked
the
low
door
and
entered
the
cemetery
it
was
a
vast
and
spacious
square
planted
with
yew
trees
half
of
it
belonged
to
the
abbey
the
other
half
was
the
property
of
the
sisterhood
of
st
clare
and
was
protected
by
a
roof
of
stone
the
division
was
marked
by
an
iron
railing
the
wicket
of
which
was
generally
left
unlocked
thither
matilda
bent
her
course
she
opened
the
wicket
and
sought
for
the
door
leading
to
the
subterraneous
vaults
where
reposed
the
mouldering
bodies
of
the
votaries
of
st
clare
the
night
was
perfectly
dark
neither
moon
or
stars
were
visible
luckily
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
and
the
friar
bore
his
lamp
in
full
security
by
the
assistance
of
its
beams
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
was
soon
discovered
it
was
sunk
within
the
hollow
of
a
wall
and
almost
concealed
by
thick
festoons
of
ivy
hanging
over
it
three
steps
of
rough-hewn
stone
conducted
to
it
and
matilda
was
on
the
point
of
descending
them
when
she
suddenly
started
back
'there
are
people
in
the
vaults'
she
whispered
to
the
monk
'conceal
yourself
till
they
are
past
she
took
refuge
behind
a
lofty
and
magnificent
tomb
erected
in
honour
of
the
convent's
foundress
ambrosio
followed
her
example
carefully
hiding
his
lamp
lest
its
beams
should
betray
them
but
a
few
moments
had
elapsed
when
the
door
was
pushed
open
leading
to
the
subterraneous
caverns
rays
of
light
proceeded
up
the
staircase
they
enabled
the
concealed
spectators
to
observe
two
females
drest
in
religious
habits
who
seemed
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
the
abbot
had
no
difficulty
to
recognize
the
prioress
of
st
clare
in
the
first
and
one
of
the
elder
nuns
in
her
companion
'every
thing
is
prepared'
said
the
prioress
'her
fate
shall
be
decided
tomorrow
all
her
tears
and
sighs
will
be
unavailing
no
in
five
and
twenty
years
that
i
have
been
superior
of
this
convent
never
did
i
witness
a
transaction
more
infamous'
'you
must
expect
much
opposition
to
your
will'
the
other
replied
in
a
milder
voice
'agnes
has
many
friends
in
the
convent
and
in
particular
the
mother
st
ursula
will
espouse
her
cause
most
warmly
in
truth
she
merits
to
have
friends
and
i
wish
i
could
prevail
upon
you
to
consider
her
youth
and
her
peculiar
situation
she
seems
sensible
of
her
fault
the
excess
of
her
grief
proves
her
penitence
and
i
am
convinced
that
her
tears
flow
more
from
contrition
than
fear
of
punishment
reverend
mother
would
you
be
persuaded
to
mitigate
the
severity
of
your
sentence
would
you
but
deign
to
overlook
this
first
transgression
i
offer
myself
as
the
pledge
of
her
future
conduct'
'overlook
it
say
you
mother
camilla
you
amaze
me
what
after
disgracing
me
in
the
presence
of
madrid's
idol
of
the
very
man
on
whom
i
most
wished
to
impress
an
idea
of
the
strictness
of
my
discipline
how
despicable
must
i
have
appeared
to
the
reverend
abbot
no
mother
no
i
never
can
forgive
the
insult
i
cannot
better
convince
ambrosio
that
i
abhor
such
crimes
than
by
punishing
that
of
agnes
with
all
the
rigour
of
which
our
severe
laws
admit
cease
then
your
supplications
they
will
all
be
unavailing
my
resolution
is
taken
tomorrow
agnes
shall
be
made
a
terrible
example
of
my
justice
and
resentment'
the
mother
camilla
seemed
not
to
give
up
the
point
but
by
this
time
the
nuns
were
out
of
hearing
the
prioress
unlocked
the
door
which
communicated
with
st
clare's
chapel
and
having
entered
with
her
companion
closed
it
again
after
them
matilda
now
asked
who
was
this
agnes
with
whom
the
prioress
was
thus
incensed
and
what
connexion
she
could
have
with
ambrosio
he
related
her
adventure
and
he
added
that
since
that
time
his
ideas
having
undergone
a
thorough
revolution
he
now
felt
much
compassion
for
the
unfortunate
nun
'i
design'
said
he
'to
request
an
audience
of
the
domina
tomorrow
and
use
every
means
of
obtaining
a
mitigation
of
her
sentence'
'beware
of
what
you
do'
interrupted
matilda
'your
sudden
change
of
sentiment
may
naturally
create
surprize
and
may
give
birth
to
suspicions
which
it
is
most
our
interest
to
avoid
rather
redouble
your
outward
austerity
and
thunder
out
menaces
against
the
errors
of
others
the
better
to
conceal
your
own
abandon
the
nun
to
her
fate
your
interfering
might
be
dangerous
and
her
imprudence
merits
to
be
punished
she
is
unworthy
to
enjoy
love's
pleasures
who
has
not
wit
enough
to
conceal
them
but
in
discussing
this
trifling
subject
i
waste
moments
which
are
precious
the
night
flies
apace
and
much
must
be
done
before
morning
the
nuns
are
retired
all
is
safe
give
me
the
lamp
ambrosio
i
must
descend
alone
into
these
caverns
wait
here
and
if
any
one
approaches
warn
me
by
your
voice
but
as
you
value
your
existence
presume
not
to
follow
me
your
life
would
fall
a
victim
to
your
imprudent
curiosity'
thus
saying
she
advanced
towards
the
sepulchre
still
holding
her
lamp
in
one
hand
and
her
little
basket
in
the
other
she
touched
the
door
it
turned
slowly
upon
its
grating
hinges
and
a
narrow
winding
staircase
of
black
marble
presented
itself
to
her
eyes
she
descended
it
ambrosio
remained
above
watching
the
faint
beams
of
the
lamp
as
they
still
proceeded
up
the
stairs
they
disappeared
and
he
found
himself
in
total
darkness
left
to
himself
he
could
not
reflect
without
surprize
on
the
sudden
change
in
matilda's
character
and
sentiments
but
a
few
days
had
past
since
she
appeared
the
mildest
and
softest
of
her
sex
devoted
to
his
will
and
looking
up
to
him
as
to
a
superior
being
now
she
assumed
a
sort
of
courage
and
manliness
in
her
manners
and
discourse
but
ill-calculated
to
please
him
she
spoke
no
longer
to
insinuate
but
command
he
found
himself
unable
to
cope
with
her
in
argument
and
was
unwillingly
obliged
to
confess
the
superiority
of
her
judgment
every
moment
convinced
him
of
the
astonishing
powers
of
her
mind
but
what
she
gained
in
the
opinion
of
the
man
she
lost
with
interest
in
the
affection
of
the
lover
he
regretted
rosario
the
fond
the
gentle
and
submissive
he
grieved
that
matilda
preferred
the
virtues
of
his
sex
to
those
of
her
own
and
when
he
thought
of
her
expressions
respecting
the
devoted
nun
he
could
not
help
blaming
them
as
cruel
and
unfeminine
pity
is
a
sentiment
so
natural
so
appropriate
to
the
female
character
that
it
is
scarcely
a
merit
for
a
woman
to
possess
it
but
to
be
without
it
is
a
grievous
crime
ambrosio
could
not
easily
forgive
his
mistress
for
being
deficient
in
this
amiable
quality
however
though
he
blamed
her
insensibility
he
felt
the
truth
of
her
observations
and
though
he
pitied
sincerely
the
unfortunate
agnes
he
resolved
to
drop
the
idea
of
interposing
in
her
behalf
near
an
hour
had
elapsed
since
matilda
descended
into
the
caverns
still
she
returned
not
ambrosio's
curiosity
was
excited
he
drew
near
the
staircase
he
listened
all
was
silent
except
that
at
intervals
he
caught
the
sound
of
matilda's
voice
as
it
wound
along
the
subterraneous
passages
and
was
re-echoed
by
the
sepulchre's
vaulted
roofs
she
was
at
too
great
a
distance
for
him
to
distinguish
her
words
and
ere
they
reached
him
they
were
deadened
into
a
low
murmur
he
longed
to
penetrate
into
this
mystery
he
resolved
to
disobey
her
injunctions
and
follow
her
into
the
cavern
he
advanced
to
the
staircase
he
had
already
descended
some
steps
when
his
courage
failed
him
he
remembered
matilda's
menaces
if
he
infringed
her
orders
and
his
bosom
was
filled
with
a
secret
unaccountable
awe
he
returned
up
the
stairs
resumed
his
former
station
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
conclusion
of
this
adventure
suddenly
he
was
sensible
of
a
violent
shock
an
earthquake
rocked
the
ground
the
columns
which
supported
the
roof
under
which
he
stood
were
so
strongly
shaken
that
every
moment
menaced
him
with
its
fall
and
at
the
same
moment
he
heard
a
loud
and
tremendous
burst
of
thunder
it
ceased
and
his
eyes
being
fixed
upon
the
staircase
he
saw
a
bright
column
of
light
flash
along
the
caverns
beneath
it
was
seen
but
for
an
instant
no
sooner
did
it
disappear
than
all
was
once
more
quiet
and
obscure
profound
darkness
again
surrounded
him
and
the
silence
of
night
was
only
broken
by
the
whirring
bat
as
she
flitted
slowly
by
him
with
every
instant
ambrosio's
amazement
increased
another
hour
elapsed
after
which
the
same
light
again
appeared
and
was
lost
again
as
suddenly
it
was
accompanied
by
a
strain
of
sweet
but
solemn
music
which
as
it
stole
through
the
vaults
below
inspired
the
monk
with
mingled
delight
and
terror
it
had
not
long
been
hushed
when
he
heard
matilda's
steps
upon
the
staircase
she
ascended
from
the
cavern
the
most
lively
joy
animated
her
beautiful
features
'did
you
see
any
thing'
she
asked
'twice
i
saw
a
column
of
light
flash
up
the
staircase'
'nothing
else'
'nothing'
'the
morning
is
on
the
point
of
breaking
let
us
retire
to
the
abbey
lest
daylight
should
betray
us'
with
a
light
step
she
hastened
from
the
burying-ground
she
regained
her
cell
and
the
curious
abbot
still
accompanied
her
she
closed
the
door
and
disembarrassed
herself
of
her
lamp
and
basket
'i
have
succeeded'
she
cried
throwing
herself
upon
his
bosom
'succeeded
beyond
my
fondest
hopes
i
shall
live
ambrosio
shall
live
for
you
the
step
which
i
shuddered
at
taking
proves
to
me
a
source
of
joys
inexpressible
oh
that
i
dared
communicate
those
joys
to
you
oh
that
i
were
permitted
to
share
with
you
my
power
and
raise
you
as
high
above
the
level
of
your
sex
as
one
bold
deed
has
exalted
me
above
mine'
'and
what
prevents
you
matilda'
interrupted
the
friar
'why
is
your
business
in
the
cavern
made
a
secret
do
you
think
me
undeserving
of
your
confidence
matilda
i
must
doubt
the
truth
of
your
affection
while
you
have
joys
in
which
i
am
forbidden
to
share'
'you
reproach
me
with
injustice
i
grieve
sincerely
that
i
am
obliged
to
conceal
from
you
my
happiness
but
i
am
not
to
blame
the
fault
lies
not
in
me
but
in
yourself
my
ambrosio
you
are
still
too
much
the
monk
your
mind
is
enslaved
by
the
prejudices
of
education
and
superstition
might
make
you
shudder
at
the
idea
of
that
which
experience
has
taught
me
to
prize
and
value
at
present
you
are
unfit
to
be
trusted
with
a
secret
of
such
importance
but
the
strength
of
your
judgment
and
the
curiosity
which
i
rejoice
to
see
sparkling
in
your
eyes
makes
me
hope
that
you
will
one
day
deserve
my
confidence
till
that
period
arrives
restrain
your
impatience
remember
that
you
have
given
me
your
solemn
oath
never
to
enquire
into
this
night's
adventures
i
insist
upon
your
keeping
this
oath
for
though'
she
added
smiling
while
she
sealed
his
lips
with
a
wanton
kiss
'though
i
forgive
your
breaking
your
vows
to
heaven
i
expect
you
to
keep
your
vows
to
me'
the
friar
returned
the
embrace
which
had
set
his
blood
on
fire
the
luxurious
and
unbounded
excesses
of
the
former
night
were
renewed
and
they
separated
not
till
the
bell
rang
for
matins
the
same
pleasures
were
frequently
repeated
the
monks
rejoiced
in
the
feigned
rosario's
unexpected
recovery
and
none
of
them
suspected
his
real
sex
the
abbot
possessed
his
mistress
in
tranquillity
and
perceiving
his
frailty
unsuspected
abandoned
himself
to
his
passions
in
full
security
shame
and
remorse
no
longer
tormented
him
frequent
repetitions
made
him
familiar
with
sin
and
his
bosom
became
proof
against
the
stings
of
conscience
in
these
sentiments
he
was
encouraged
by
matilda
but
she
soon
was
aware
that
she
had
satiated
her
lover
by
the
unbounded
freedom
of
her
caresses
her
charms
becoming
accustomed
to
him
they
ceased
to
excite
the
same
desires
which
at
first
they
had
inspired
the
delirium
of
passion
being
past
he
had
leisure
to
observe
every
trifling
defect
where
none
were
to
be
found
satiety
made
him
fancy
them
the
monk
was
glutted
with
the
fullness
of
pleasure
a
week
had
scarcely
elapsed
before
he
was
wearied
of
his
paramour
his
warm
constitution
still
made
him
seek
in
her
arms
the
gratification
of
his
lust
but
when
the
moment
of
passion
was
over
he
quitted
her
with
disgust
and
his
humour
naturally
inconstant
made
him
sigh
impatiently
for
variety
possession
which
cloys
man
only
increases
the
affection
of
woman
matilda
with
every
succeeding
day
grew
more
attached
to
the
friar
since
he
had
obtained
her
favours
he
was
become
dearer
to
her
than
ever
and
she
felt
grateful
to
him
for
the
pleasures
in
which
they
had
equally
been
sharers
unfortunately
as
her
passion
grew
ardent
ambrosio's
grew
cold
the
very
marks
of
her
fondness
excited
his
disgust
and
its
excess
served
to
extinguish
the
flame
which
already
burned
but
feebly
in
his
bosom
matilda
could
not
but
remark
that
her
society
seemed
to
him
daily
less
agreeable
he
was
inattentive
while
she
spoke
her
musical
talents
which
she
possessed
in
perfection
had
lost
the
power
of
amusing
him
or
if
he
deigned
to
praise
them
his
compliments
were
evidently
forced
and
cold
he
no
longer
gazed
upon
her
with
affection
or
applauded
her
sentiments
with
a
lover's
partiality
this
matilda
well
perceived
and
redoubled
her
efforts
to
revive
those
sentiments
which
he
once
had
felt
she
could
not
but
fail
since
he
considered
as
importunities
the
pains
which
she
took
to
please
him
and
was
disgusted
by
the
very
means
which
she
used
to
recall
the
wanderer
still
however
their
illicit
commerce
continued
but
it
was
clear
that
he
was
led
to
her
arms
not
by
love
but
the
cravings
of
brutal
appetite
his
constitution
made
a
woman
necessary
to
him
and
matilda
was
the
only
one
with
whom
he
could
indulge
his
passions
safely
in
spite
of
her
beauty
he
gazed
upon
every
other
female
with
more
desire
but
fearing
that
his
hypocrisy
should
be
made
public
he
confined
his
inclinations
to
his
own
breast
it
was
by
no
means
his
nature
to
be
timid
but
his
education
had
impressed
his
mind
with
fear
so
strongly
that
apprehension
was
now
become
part
of
his
character
had
his
youth
been
passed
in
the
world
he
would
have
shown
himself
possessed
of
many
brilliant
and
manly
qualities
he
was
naturally
enterprizing
firm
and
fearless
he
had
a
warrior's
heart
and
he
might
have
shone
with
splendour
at
the
head
of
an
army
there
was
no
want
of
generosity
in
his
nature
the
wretched
never
failed
to
find
in
him
a
compassionate
auditor
his
abilities
were
quick
and
shining
and
his
judgment
vast
solid
and
decisive
with
such
qualifications
he
would
have
been
an
ornament
to
his
country
that
he
possessed
them
he
had
given
proofs
in
his
earliest
infancy
and
his
parents
had
beheld
his
dawning
virtues
with
the
fondest
delight
and
admiration
unfortunately
while
yet
a
child
he
was
deprived
of
those
parents
he
fell
into
the
power
of
a
relation
whose
only
wish
about
him
was
never
to
hear
of
him
more
for
that
purpose
he
gave
him
in
charge
to
his
friend
the
former
superior
of
the
capuchins
the
abbot
a
very
monk
used
all
his
endeavours
to
persuade
the
boy
that
happiness
existed
not
without
the
walls
of
a
convent
he
succeeded
fully
to
deserve
admittance
into
the
order
of
st
francis
was
ambrosio's
highest
ambition
his
instructors
carefully
repressed
those
virtues
whose
grandeur
and
disinterestedness
were
ill-suited
to
the
cloister
instead
of
universal
benevolence
he
adopted
a
selfish
partiality
for
his
own
particular
establishment
he
was
taught
to
consider
compassion
for
the
errors
of
others
as
a
crime
of
the
blackest
dye
the
noble
frankness
of
his
temper
was
exchanged
for
servile
humility
and
in
order
to
break
his
natural
spirit
the
monks
terrified
his
young
mind
by
placing
before
him
all
the
horrors
with
which
superstition
could
furnish
them
they
painted
to
him
the
torments
of
the
damned
in
colours
the
most
dark
terrible
and
fantastic
and
threatened
him
at
the
slightest
fault
with
eternal
perdition
no
wonder
that
his
imagination
constantly
dwelling
upon
these
fearful
objects
should
have
rendered
his
character
timid
and
apprehensive
add
to
this
that
his
long
absence
from
the
great
world
and
total
unacquaintance
with
the
common
dangers
of
life
made
him
form
of
them
an
idea
far
more
dismal
than
the
reality
while
the
monks
were
busied
in
rooting
out
his
virtues
and
narrowing
his
sentiments
they
allowed
every
vice
which
had
fallen
to
his
share
to
arrive
at
full
perfection
he
was
suffered
to
be
proud
vain
ambitious
and
disdainful
he
was
jealous
of
his
equals
and
despised
all
merit
but
his
own
he
was
implacable
when
offended
and
cruel
in
his
revenge
still
in
spite
of
the
pains
taken
to
pervert
them
his
natural
good
qualities
would
occasionally
break
through
the
gloom
cast
over
them
so
carefully
at
such
times
the
contest
for
superiority
between
his
real
and
acquired
character
was
striking
and
unaccountable
to
those
unacquainted
with
his
original
disposition
he
pronounced
the
most
severe
sentences
upon
offenders
which
the
moment
after
compassion
induced
him
to
mitigate
he
undertook
the
most
daring
enterprizes
which
the
fear
of
their
consequences
soon
obliged
him
to
abandon
his
inborn
genius
darted
a
brilliant
light
upon
subjects
the
most
obscure
and
almost
instantaneously
his
superstition
replunged
them
in
darkness
more
profound
than
that
from
which
they
had
just
been
rescued
his
brother
monks
regarding
him
as
a
superior
being
remarked
not
this
contradiction
in
their
idol's
conduct
they
were
persuaded
that
what
he
did
must
be
right
and
supposed
him
to
have
good
reasons
for
changing
his
resolutions
the
fact
was
that
the
different
sentiments
with
which
education
and
nature
had
inspired
him
were
combating
in
his
bosom
it
remained
for
his
passions
which
as
yet
no
opportunity
had
called
into
play
to
decide
the
victory
unfortunately
his
passions
were
the
very
worst
judges
to
whom
he
could
possibly
have
applied
his
monastic
seclusion
had
till
now
been
in
his
favour
since
it
gave
him
no
room
for
discovering
his
bad
qualities
the
superiority
of
his
talents
raised
him
too
far
above
his
companions
to
permit
his
being
jealous
of
them
his
exemplary
piety
persuasive
eloquence
and
pleasing
manners
had
secured
him
universal
esteem
and
consequently
he
had
no
injuries
to
revenge
his
ambition
was
justified
by
his
acknowledged
merit
and
his
pride
considered
as
no
more
than
proper
confidence
he
never
saw
much
less
conversed
with
the
other
sex
he
was
ignorant
of
the
pleasures
in
woman's
power
to
bestow
and
if
he
read
in
the
course
of
his
studies
'that
men
were
fond
he
smiled
and
wondered
how'
for
a
time
spare
diet
frequent
watching
and
severe
penance
cooled
and
represt
the
natural
warmth
of
his
constitution
but
no
sooner
did
opportunity
present
itself
no
sooner
did
he
catch
a
glimpse
of
joys
to
which
he
was
still
a
stranger
than
religion's
barriers
were
too
feeble
to
resist
the
overwhelming
torrent
of
his
desires
all
impediments
yielded
before
the
force
of
his
temperament
warm
sanguine
and
voluptuous
in
the
excess
as
yet
his
other
passions
lay
dormant
but
they
only
needed
to
be
once
awakened
to
display
themselves
with
violence
as
great
and
irresistible
he
continued
to
be
the
admiration
of
madrid
the
enthusiasm
created
by
his
eloquence
seemed
rather
to
increase
than
diminish
every
thursday
which
was
the
only
day
when
he
appeared
in
public
the
capuchin
cathedral
was
crowded
with
auditors
and
his
discourse
was
always
received
with
the
same
approbation
he
was
named
confessor
to
all
the
chief
families
in
madrid
and
no
one
was
counted
fashionable
who
was
injoined
penance
by
any
other
than
ambrosio
in
his
resolution
of
never
stirring
out
of
his
convent
he
still
persisted
this
circumstance
created
a
still
greater
opinion
of
his
sanctity
and
self-denial
above
all
the
women
sang
forth
his
praises
loudly
less
influenced
by
devotion
than
by
his
noble
countenance
majestic
air
and
well-turned
graceful
figure
the
abbey
door
was
thronged
with
carriages
from
morning
to
night
and
the
noblest
and
fairest
dames
of
madrid
confessed
to
the
abbot
their
secret
peccadilloes
the
eyes
of
the
luxurious
friar
devoured
their
charms
had
his
penitents
consulted
those
interpreters
he
would
have
needed
no
other
means
of
expressing
his
desires
for
his
misfortune
they
were
so
strongly
persuaded
of
his
continence
that
the
possibility
of
his
harbouring
indecent
thoughts
never
once
entered
their
imaginations
the
climate's
heat
'tis
well
known
operates
with
no
small
influence
upon
the
constitutions
of
the
spanish
ladies
but
the
most
abandoned
would
have
thought
it
an
easier
task
to
inspire
with
passion
the
marble
statue
of
st
francis
than
the
cold
and
rigid
heart
of
the
immaculate
ambrosio
on
his
part
the
friar
was
little
acquainted
with
the
depravity
of
the
world
he
suspected
not
that
but
few
of
his
penitents
would
have
rejected
his
addresses
yet
had
he
been
better
instructed
on
this
head
the
danger
attending
such
an
attempt
would
have
sealed
up
his
lips
in
silence
he
knew
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
a
woman
to
keep
a
secret
so
strange
and
so
important
as
his
frailty
and
he
even
trembled
lest
matilda
should
betray
him
anxious
to
preserve
a
reputation
which
was
infinitely
dear
to
him
he
saw
all
the
risque
of
committing
it
to
the
power
of
some
vain
giddy
female
and
as
the
beauties
of
madrid
affected
only
his
senses
without
touching
his
heart
he
forgot
them
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
his
sight
the
danger
of
discovery
the
fear
of
being
repulsed
the
loss
of
reputation
all
these
considerations
counselled
him
to
stifle
his
desires
and
though
he
now
felt
for
it
the
most
perfect
indifference
he
was
necessitated
to
confine
himself
to
matilda's
person
one
morning
the
confluence
of
penitents
was
greater
than
usual
he
was
detained
in
the
confessional
chair
till
a
late
hour
at
length
the
crowd
was
dispatched
and
he
prepared
to
quit
the
chapel
when
two
females
entered
and
drew
near
him
with
humility
they
threw
up
their
veils
and
the
youngest
entreated
him
to
listen
to
her
for
a
few
moments
the
melody
of
her
voice
of
that
voice
to
which
no
man
ever
listened
without
interest
immediately
caught
ambrosio's
attention
he
stopped
the
petitioner
seemed
bowed
down
with
affliction
her
cheeks
were
pale
her
eyes
dimmed
with
tears
and
her
hair
fell
in
disorder
over
her
face
and
bosom
still
her
countenance
was
so
sweet
so
innocent
so
heavenly
as
might
have
charmed
an
heart
less
susceptible
than
that
which
panted
in
the
abbot's
breast
with
more
than
usual
softness
of
manner
he
desired
her
to
proceed
and
heard
her
speak
as
follows
with
an
emotion
which
increased
every
moment
'reverend
father
you
see
an
unfortunate
threatened
with
the
loss
of
her
dearest
of
almost
her
only
friend
my
mother
my
excellent
mother
lies
upon
the
bed
of
sickness
a
sudden
and
dreadful
malady
seized
her
last
night
and
so
rapid
has
been
its
progress
that
the
physicians
despair
of
her
life
human
aid
fails
me
nothing
remains
for
me
but
to
implore
the
mercy
of
heaven
father
all
madrid
rings
with
the
report
of
your
piety
and
virtue
deign
to
remember
my
mother
in
your
prayers
perhaps
they
may
prevail
on
the
almighty
to
spare
her
and
should
that
be
the
case
i
engage
myself
every
thursday
in
the
next
three
months
to
illuminate
the
shrine
of
st
francis
in
his
honour'
'so'
thought
the
monk
'here
we
have
a
second
vincentio
della
ronda
rosario's
adventure
began
thus'
and
he
wished
secretly
that
this
might
have
the
same
conclusion
he
acceded
to
the
request
the
petitioner
returned
him
thanks
with
every
mark
of
gratitude
and
then
continued
'i
have
yet
another
favour
to
ask
we
are
strangers
in
madrid
my
mother
needs
a
confessor
and
knows
not
to
whom
she
should
apply
we
understand
that
you
never
quit
the
abbey
and
alas
my
poor
mother
is
unable
to
come
hither
if
you
would
have
the
goodness
reverend
father
to
name
a
proper
person
whose
wise
and
pious
consolations
may
soften
the
agonies
of
my
parent's
deathbed
you
will
confer
an
everlasting
favour
upon
hearts
not
ungrateful'
with
this
petition
also
the
monk
complied
indeed
what
petition
would
he
have
refused
if
urged
in
such
enchanting
accents
the
suppliant
was
so
interesting
her
voice
was
so
sweet
so
harmonious
her
very
tears
became
her
and
her
affliction
seemed
to
add
new
lustre
to
her
charms
he
promised
to
send
to
her
a
confessor
that
same
evening
and
begged
her
to
leave
her
address
the
companion
presented
him
with
a
card
on
which
it
was
written
and
then
withdrew
with
the
fair
petitioner
who
pronounced
before
her
departure
a
thousand
benedictions
on
the
abbot's
goodness
his
eyes
followed
her
out
of
the
chapel
it
was
not
till
she
was
out
of
sight
that
he
examined
the
card
on
which
he
read
the
following
words
'donna
elvira
dalfa
strada
di
san
iago
four
doors
from
the
palace
d'albornos'
the
suppliant
was
no
other
than
antonia
and
leonella
was
her
companion
the
latter
had
not
consented
without
difficulty
to
accompany
her
niece
to
the
abbey
ambrosio
had
inspired
her
with
such
awe
that
she
trembled
at
the
very
sight
of
him
her
fears
had
conquered
even
her
natural
loquacity
and
while
in
his
presence
she
uttered
not
a
single
syllable
the
monk
retired
to
his
cell
whither
he
was
pursued
by
antonia's
image
he
felt
a
thousand
new
emotions
springing
in
his
bosom
and
he
trembled
to
examine
into
the
cause
which
gave
them
birth
they
were
totally
different
from
those
inspired
by
matilda
when
she
first
declared
her
sex
and
her
affection
he
felt
not
the
provocation
of
lust
no
voluptuous
desires
rioted
in
his
bosom
nor
did
a
burning
imagination
picture
to
him
the
charms
which
modesty
had
veiled
from
his
eyes
on
the
contrary
what
he
now
felt
was
a
mingled
sentiment
of
tenderness
admiration
and
respect
a
soft
and
delicious
melancholy
infused
itself
into
his
soul
and
he
would
not
have
exchanged
it
for
the
most
lively
transports
of
joy
society
now
disgusted
him
he
delighted
in
solitude
which
permitted
his
indulging
the
visions
of
fancy
his
thoughts
were
all
gentle
sad
and
soothing
and
the
whole
wide
world
presented
him
with
no
other
object
than
antonia
'happy
man'
he
exclaimed
in
his
romantic
enthusiasm
'happy
man
who
is
destined
to
possess
the
heart
of
that
lovely
girl
what
delicacy
in
her
features
what
elegance
in
her
form
how
enchanting
was
the
timid
innocence
of
her
eyes
and
how
different
from
the
wanton
expression
the
wild
luxurious
fire
which
sparkles
in
matilda's
oh
sweeter
must
one
kiss
be
snatched
from
the
rosy
lips
of
the
first
than
all
the
full
and
lustful
favours
bestowed
so
freely
by
the
second
matilda
gluts
me
with
enjoyment
even
to
loathing
forces
me
to
her
arms
apes
the
harlot
and
glories
in
her
prostitution
disgusting
did
she
know
the
inexpressible
charm
of
modesty
how
irresistibly
it
enthralls
the
heart
of
man
how
firmly
it
chains
him
to
the
throne
of
beauty
she
never
would
have
thrown
it
off
what
would
be
too
dear
a
price
for
this
lovely
girl's
affections
what
would
i
refuse
to
sacrifice
could
i
be
released
from
my
vows
and
permitted
to
declare
my
love
in
the
sight
of
earth
and
heaven
while
i
strove
to
inspire
her
with
tenderness
with
friendship
and
esteem
how
tranquil
and
undisturbed
would
the
hours
roll
away
gracious
god
to
see
her
blue
downcast
eyes
beam
upon
mine
with
timid
fondness
to
sit
for
days
for
years
listening
to
that
gentle
voice
to
acquire
the
right
of
obliging
her
and
hear
the
artless
expressions
of
her
gratitude
to
watch
the
emotions
of
her
spotless
heart
to
encourage
each
dawning
virtue
to
share
in
her
joy
when
happy
to
kiss
away
her
tears
when
distrest
and
to
see
her
fly
to
my
arms
for
comfort
and
support
yes
if
there
is
perfect
bliss
on
earth
'tis
his
lot
alone
who
becomes
that
angel's
husband'
while
his
fancy
coined
these
ideas
he
paced
his
cell
with
a
disordered
air
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
vacancy
his
head
reclined
upon
his
shoulder
a
tear
rolled
down
his
cheek
while
he
reflected
that
the
vision
of
happiness
for
him
could
never
be
realized
'she
is
lost
to
me'
he
continued
'by
marriage
she
cannot
be
mine
and
to
seduce
such
innocence
to
use
the
confidence
reposed
in
me
to
work
her
ruin
oh
it
would
be
a
crime
blacker
than
yet
the
world
ever
witnessed
fear
not
lovely
girl
your
virtue
runs
no
risque
from
me
not
for
indies
would
i
make
that
gentle
bosom
know
the
tortures
of
remorse'
again
he
paced
his
chamber
hastily
then
stopping
his
eye
fell
upon
the
picture
of
his
once-admired
madona
he
tore
it
with
indignation
from
the
wall
he
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
spurned
it
from
him
with
his
foot
'the
prostitute'
unfortunate
matilda
her
paramour
forgot
that
for
his
sake
alone
she
had
forfeited
her
claim
to
virtue
and
his
only
reason
for
despising
her
was
that
she
had
loved
him
much
too
well
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
which
stood
near
the
table
he
saw
the
card
with
elvira's
address
he
took
it
up
and
it
brought
to
his
recollection
his
promise
respecting
a
confessor
he
passed
a
few
minutes
in
doubt
but
antonia's
empire
over
him
was
already
too
much
decided
to
permit
his
making
a
long
resistance
to
the
idea
which
struck
him
he
resolved
to
be
the
confessor
himself
he
could
leave
the
abbey
unobserved
without
difficulty
by
wrapping
up
his
head
in
his
cowl
he
hoped
to
pass
through
the
streets
without
being
recognised
by
taking
these
precautions
and
by
recommending
secrecy
to
elvira's
family
he
doubted
not
to
keep
madrid
in
ignorance
that
he
had
broken
his
vow
never
to
see
the
outside
of
the
abbey
walls
matilda
was
the
only
person
whose
vigilance
he
dreaded
but
by
informing
her
at
the
refectory
that
during
the
whole
of
that
day
business
would
confine
him
to
his
cell
he
thought
himself
secure
from
her
wakeful
jealousy
accordingly
at
the
hours
when
the
spaniards
are
generally
taking
their
siesta
he
ventured
to
quit
the
abbey
by
a
private
door
the
key
of
which
was
in
his
possession
the
cowl
of
his
habit
was
thrown
over
his
face
from
the
heat
of
the
weather
the
streets
were
almost
totally
deserted
the
monk
met
with
few
people
found
the
strada
di
san
iago
and
arrived
without
accident
at
donna
elvira's
door
he
rang
was
admitted
and
immediately
ushered
into
an
upper
apartment
it
was
here
that
he
ran
the
greatest
risque
of
a
discovery
had
leonella
been
at
home
she
would
have
recognized
him
directly
her
communicative
disposition
would
never
have
permitted
her
to
rest
till
all
madrid
was
informed
that
ambrosio
had
ventured
out
of
the
abbey
and
visited
her
sister
fortune
here
stood
the
monk's
friend
on
leonella's
return
home
she
found
a
letter
instructing
her
that
a
cousin
was
just
dead
who
had
left
what
little
he
possessed
between
herself
and
elvira
to
secure
this
bequest
she
was
obliged
to
set
out
for
cordova
without
losing
a
moment
amidst
all
her
foibles
her
heart
was
truly
warm
and
affectionate
and
she
was
unwilling
to
quit
her
sister
in
so
dangerous
a
state
but
elvira
insisted
upon
her
taking
the
journey
conscious
that
in
her
daughter's
forlorn
situation
no
increase
of
fortune
however
trifling
ought
to
be
neglected
accordingly
leonella
left
madrid
sincerely
grieved
at
her
sister's
illness
and
giving
some
few
sighs
to
the
memory
of
the
amiable
but
inconstant
don
christoval
she
was
fully
persuaded
that
at
first
she
had
made
a
terrible
breach
in
his
heart
but
hearing
nothing
more
of
him
she
supposed
that
he
had
quitted
the
pursuit
disgusted
by
the
lowness
of
her
origin
and
knowing
upon
other
terms
than
marriage
he
had
nothing
to
hope
from
such
a
dragon
of
virtue
as
she
professed
herself
or
else
that
being
naturally
capricious
and
changeable
the
remembrance
of
her
charms
had
been
effaced
from
the
conde's
heart
by
those
of
some
newer
beauty
whatever
was
the
cause
of
her
losing
him
she
lamented
it
sorely
she
strove
in
vain
as
she
assured
every
body
who
was
kind
enough
to
listen
to
her
to
tear
his
image
from
her
too
susceptible
heart
she
affected
the
airs
of
a
lovesick
virgin
and
carried
them
all
to
the
most
ridiculous
excess
she
heaved
lamentable
sighs
walked
with
her
arms
folded
uttered
long
soliloquies
and
her
discourse
generally
turned
upon
some
forsaken
maid
who
expired
of
a
broken
heart
her
fiery
locks
were
always
ornamented
with
a
garland
of
willow
every
evening
she
was
seen
straying
upon
the
banks
of
a
rivulet
by
moonlight
and
she
declared
herself
a
violent
admirer
of
murmuring
streams
and
nightingales
'of
lonely
haunts
and
twilight
groves
'places
which
pale
passion
loves'
such
was
the
state
of
leonella's
mind
when
obliged
to
quit
madrid
elvira
was
out
of
patience
at
all
these
follies
and
endeavoured
at
persuading
her
to
act
like
a
reasonable
woman
her
advice
was
thrown
away
leonella
assured
her
at
parting
that
nothing
could
make
her
forget
the
perfidious
don
christoval
in
this
point
she
was
fortunately
mistaken
an
honest
youth
of
cordova
journeyman
to
an
apothecary
found
that
her
fortune
would
be
sufficient
to
set
him
up
in
a
genteel
shop
of
his
own
in
consequence
of
this
reflection
he
avowed
himself
her
admirer
leonella
was
not
inflexible
the
ardour
of
his
sighs
melted
her
heart
and
she
soon
consented
to
make
him
the
happiest
of
mankind
she
wrote
to
inform
her
sister
of
her
marriage
but
for
reasons
which
will
be
explained
hereafter
elvira
never
answered
her
letter
ambrosio
was
conducted
into
the
antichamber
to
that
where
elvira
was
reposing
the
female
domestic
who
had
admitted
him
left
him
alone
while
she
announced
his
arrival
to
her
mistress
antonia
who
had
been
by
her
mother's
bedside
immediately
came
to
him
'pardon
me
father'
said
she
advancing
towards
him
when
recognizing
his
features
she
stopped
suddenly
and
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
'is
it
possible'
she
continued
'do
not
my
eyes
deceive
me
has
the
worthy
ambrosio
broken
through
his
resolution
that
he
may
soften
the
agonies
of
the
best
of
women
what
pleasure
will
this
visit
give
my
mother
let
me
not
delay
for
a
moment
the
comfort
which
your
piety
and
wisdom
will
afford
her'
thus
saying
she
opened
the
chamber
door
presented
to
her
mother
her
distinguished
visitor
and
having
placed
an
armed-chair
by
the
side
of
the
bed
withdrew
into
another
department
elvira
was
highly
gratified
by
this
visit
her
expectations
had
been
raised
high
by
general
report
but
she
found
them
far
exceeded
ambrosio
endowed
by
nature
with
powers
of
pleasing
exerted
them
to
the
utmost
while
conversing
with
antonia's
mother
with
persuasive
eloquence
he
calmed
every
fear
and
dissipated
every
scruple
he
bad
her
reflect
on
the
infinite
mercy
of
her
judge
despoiled
death
of
his
darts
and
terrors
and
taught
her
to
view
without
shrinking
the
abyss
of
eternity
on
whose
brink
she
then
stood
elvira
was
absorbed
in
attention
and
delight
while
she
listened
to
his
exhortations
confidence
and
comfort
stole
insensibly
into
her
mind
she
unbosomed
to
him
without
hesitation
her
cares
and
apprehensions
the
latter
respecting
a
future
life
he
had
already
quieted
and
he
now
removed
the
former
which
she
felt
for
the
concerns
of
this
she
trembled
for
antonia
she
had
none
to
whose
care
she
could
recommend
her
save
to
the
marquis
de
las
cisternas
and
her
sister
leonella
the
protection
of
the
one
was
very
uncertain
and
as
to
the
other
though
fond
of
her
niece
leonella
was
so
thoughtless
and
vain
as
to
make
her
an
improper
person
to
have
the
sole
direction
of
a
girl
so
young
and
ignorant
of
the
world
the
friar
no
sooner
learnt
the
cause
of
her
alarms
than
he
begged
her
to
make
herself
easy
upon
that
head
he
doubted
not
being
able
to
secure
for
antonia
a
safe
refuge
in
the
house
of
one
of
his
penitents
the
marchioness
of
villa-franca
this
was
a
lady
of
acknowledged
virtue
remarkable
for
strict
principles
and
extensive
charity
should
accident
deprive
her
of
this
resource
he
engaged
to
procure
antonia
a
reception
in
some
respectable
convent
that
is
to
say
in
quality
of
boarder
for
elvira
had
declared
herself
no
friend
to
a
monastic
life
and
the
monk
was
either
candid
or
complaisant
enough
to
allow
that
her
disapprobation
was
not
unfounded
these
proofs
of
the
interest
which
he
felt
for
her
completely
won
elvira's
heart
in
thanking
him
she
exhausted
every
expression
which
gratitude
could
furnish
and
protested
that
now
she
should
resign
herself
with
tranquillity
to
the
grave
ambrosio
rose
to
take
leave
he
promised
to
return
the
next
day
at
the
same
hour
but
requested
that
his
visits
might
be
kept
secret
'i
am
unwilling'
said
he
'that
my
breaking
through
a
rule
imposed
by
necessity
should
be
generally
known
had
i
not
resolved
never
to
quit
my
convent
except
upon
circumstances
as
urgent
as
that
which
has
conducted
me
to
your
door
i
should
be
frequently
summoned
upon
insignificant
occasions
that
time
would
be
engrossed
by
the
curious
the
unoccupied
and
the
fanciful
which
i
now
pass
at
the
bedside
of
the
sick
in
comforting
the
expiring
penitent
and
clearing
the
passage
to
eternity
from
thorns'
elvira
commended
equally
his
prudence
and
compassion
promising
to
conceal
carefully
the
honour
of
his
visits
the
monk
then
gave
her
his
benediction
and
retired
from
the
chamber
in
the
antiroom
he
found
antonia
he
could
not
refuse
himself
the
pleasure
of
passing
a
few
moments
in
her
society
he
bad
her
take
comfort
for
that
her
mother
seemed
composed
and
tranquil
and
he
hoped
that
she
might
yet
do
well
he
enquired
who
attended
her
and
engaged
to
send
the
physician
of
his
convent
to
see
her
one
of
the
most
skilful
in
madrid
he
then
launched
out
in
elvira's
commendation
praised
her
purity
and
fortitude
of
mind
and
declared
that
she
had
inspired
him
with
the
highest
esteem
and
reverence
antonia's
innocent
heart
swelled
with
gratitude
joy
danced
in
her
eyes
where
a
tear
still
sparkled
the
hopes
which
he
gave
her
of
her
mother's
recovery
the
lively
interest
which
he
seemed
to
feel
for
her
and
the
flattering
way
in
which
she
was
mentioned
by
him
added
to
the
report
of
his
judgment
and
virtue
and
to
the
impression
made
upon
her
by
his
eloquence
confirmed
the
favourable
opinion
with
which
his
first
appearance
had
inspired
antonia
she
replied
with
diffidence
but
without
restraint
she
feared
not
to
relate
to
him
all
her
little
sorrows
all
her
little
fears
and
anxieties
and
she
thanked
him
for
his
goodness
with
all
the
genuine
warmth
which
favours
kindle
in
a
young
and
innocent
heart
such
alone
know
how
to
estimate
benefits
at
their
full
value
they
who
are
conscious
of
mankind's
perfidy
and
selfishness
ever
receive
an
obligation
with
apprehension
and
distrust
they
suspect
that
some
secret
motive
must
lurk
behind
it
they
express
their
thanks
with
restraint
and
caution
and
fear
to
praise
a
kind
action
to
its
full
extent
aware
that
some
future
day
a
return
may
be
required
not
so
antonia
she
thought
the
world
was
composed
only
of
those
who
resembled
her
and
that
vice
existed
was
to
her
still
a
secret
the
monk
had
been
of
service
to
her
he
said
that
he
wished
her
well
she
was
grateful
for
his
kindness
and
thought
that
no
terms
were
strong
enough
to
be
the
vehicle
of
her
thanks
with
what
delight
did
ambrosio
listen
to
the
declaration
of
her
artless
gratitude
the
natural
grace
of
her
manners
the
unequalled
sweetness
of
her
voice
her
modest
vivacity
her
unstudied
elegance
her
expressive
countenance
and
intelligent
eyes
united
to
inspire
him
with
pleasure
and
admiration
while
the
solidity
and
correctness
of
her
remarks
received
additional
beauty
from
the
unaffected
simplicity
of
the
language
in
which
they
were
conveyed
ambrosio
was
at
length
obliged
to
tear
himself
from
this
conversation
which
possessed
for
him
but
too
many
charms
he
repeated
to
antonia
his
wishes
that
his
visits
should
not
be
made
known
which
desire
she
promised
to
observe
he
then
quitted
the
house
while
his
enchantress
hastened
to
her
mother
ignorant
of
the
mischief
which
her
beauty
had
caused
she
was
eager
to
know
elvira's
opinion
of
the
man
whom
she
had
praised
in
such
enthusiastic
terms
and
was
delighted
to
find
it
equally
favourable
if
not
even
more
so
than
her
own
'even
before
he
spoke'
said
elvira
'i
was
prejudiced
in
his
favour
the
fervour
of
his
exhortations
dignity
of
his
manner
and
closeness
of
his
reasoning
were
very
far
from
inducing
me
to
alter
my
opinion
his
fine
and
full-toned
voice
struck
me
particularly
but
surely
antonia
i
have
heard
it
before
it
seemed
perfectly
familiar
to
my
ear
either
i
must
have
known
the
abbot
in
former
times
or
his
voice
bears
a
wonderful
resemblance
to
that
of
some
other
to
whom
i
have
often
listened
there
were
certain
tones
which
touched
my
very
heart
and
made
me
feel
sensations
so
singular
that
i
strive
in
vain
to
account
for
them'
'my
dearest
mother
it
produced
the
same
effect
upon
me
yet
certainly
neither
of
us
ever
heard
his
voice
till
we
came
to
madrid
i
suspect
that
what
we
attribute
to
his
voice
really
proceeds
from
his
pleasant
manners
which
forbid
our
considering
him
as
a
stranger
i
know
not
why
but
i
feel
more
at
my
ease
while
conversing
with
him
than
i
usually
do
with
people
who
are
unknown
to
me
i
feared
not
to
repeat
to
him
all
my
childish
thoughts
and
somehow
i
felt
confident
that
he
would
hear
my
folly
with
indulgence
oh
i
was
not
deceived
in
him
he
listened
to
me
with
such
an
air
of
kindness
and
attention
he
answered
me
with
such
gentleness
such
condescension
he
did
not
call
me
an
infant
and
treat
me
with
contempt
as
our
cross
old
confessor
at
the
castle
used
to
do
i
verily
believe
that
if
i
had
lived
in
murcia
a
thousand
years
i
never
should
have
liked
that
fat
old
father
dominic'
'i
confess
that
father
dominic
had
not
the
most
pleasing
manners
in
the
world
but
he
was
honest
friendly
and
well-meaning'
'ah
my
dear
mother
those
qualities
are
so
common'
'god
grant
my
child
that
experience
may
not
teach
you
to
think
them
rare
and
precious
i
have
found
them
but
too
much
so
but
tell
me
antonia
why
is
it
impossible
for
me
to
have
seen
the
abbot
before'
'because
since
the
moment
when
he
entered
the
abbey
he
has
never
been
on
the
outside
of
its
walls
he
told
me
just
now
that
from
his
ignorance
of
the
streets
he
had
some
difficulty
to
find
the
strada
di
san
iago
though
so
near
the
abbey'
'all
this
is
possible
and
still
i
may
have
seen
him
before
he
entered
the
abbey
in
order
to
come
out
it
was
rather
necessary
that
he
should
first
go
in'
'holy
virgin
as
you
say
that
is
very
true--oh
but
might
he
not
have
been
born
in
the
abbey'
elvira
smiled
'why
not
very
easily'
'stay
stay
now
i
recollect
how
it
was
he
was
put
into
the
abbey
quite
a
child
the
common
people
say
that
he
fell
from
heaven
and
was
sent
as
a
present
to
the
capuchins
by
the
virgin'
'that
was
very
kind
of
her
and
so
he
fell
from
heaven
antonia
he
must
have
had
a
terrible
tumble'
'many
do
not
credit
this
and
i
fancy
my
dear
mother
that
i
must
number
you
among
the
unbelievers
indeed
as
our
landlady
told
my
aunt
the
general
idea
is
that
his
parents
being
poor
and
unable
to
maintain
him
left
him
just
born
at
the
abbey
door
the
late
superior
from
pure
charity
had
him
educated
in
the
convent
and
he
proved
to
be
a
model
of
virtue
and
piety
and
learning
and
i
know
not
what
else
besides
in
consequence
he
was
first
received
as
a
brother
of
the
order
and
not
long
ago
was
chosen
abbot
however
whether
this
account
or
the
other
is
the
true
one
at
least
all
agree
that
when
the
monks
took
him
under
their
care
he
could
not
speak
therefore
you
could
not
have
heard
his
voice
before
he
entered
the
monastery
because
at
that
time
he
had
no
voice
at
all'
'upon
my
word
antonia
you
argue
very
closely
your
conclusions
are
infallible
i
did
not
suspect
you
of
being
so
able
a
logician'
'ah
you
are
mocking
me
but
so
much
the
better
it
delights
me
to
see
you
in
spirits
besides
you
seem
tranquil
and
easy
and
i
hope
that
you
will
have
no
more
convulsions
oh
i
was
sure
the
abbot's
visit
would
do
you
good'
'it
has
indeed
done
me
good
my
child
he
has
quieted
my
mind
upon
some
points
which
agitated
me
and
i
already
feel
the
effects
of
his
attention
my
eyes
grow
heavy
and
i
think
i
can
sleep
a
little
draw
the
curtains
my
antonia
but
if
i
should
not
wake
before
midnight
do
not
sit
up
with
me
i
charge
you'
antonia
promised
to
obey
her
and
having
received
her
blessing
drew
the
curtains
of
the
bed
she
then
seated
herself
in
silence
at
her
embroidery
frame
and
beguiled
the
hours
with
building
castles
in
the
air
her
spirits
were
enlivened
by
the
evident
change
for
the
better
in
elvira
and
her
fancy
presented
her
with
visions
bright
and
pleasing
in
these
dreams
ambrosio
made
no
despicable
figure
she
thought
of
him
with
joy
and
gratitude
but
for
every
idea
which
fell
to
the
friar's
share
at
least
two
were
unconsciously
bestowed
upon
lorenzo
thus
passed
the
time
till
the
bell
in
the
neighbouring
steeple
of
the
capuchin
cathedral
announced
the
hour
of
midnight
antonia
remembered
her
mother's
injunctions
and
obeyed
them
though
with
reluctance
she
undrew
the
curtains
with
caution
elvira
was
enjoying
a
profound
and
quiet
slumber
her
cheek
glowed
with
health's
returning
colours
a
smile
declared
that
her
dreams
were
pleasant
and
as
antonia
bent
over
her
she
fancied
that
she
heard
her
name
pronounced
she
kissed
her
mother's
forehead
softly
and
retired
to
her
chamber
there
she
knelt
before
a
statue
of
st
rosolia
her
patroness
she
recommended
herself
to
the
protection
of
heaven
and
as
had
been
her
custom
from
infancy
concluded
her
devotions
by
chaunting
the
following
stanzas
midnight
hymn
now
all
is
hushed
the
solemn
chime
no
longer
swells
the
nightly
gale
thy
awful
presence

sublime
with

once
more

'tis
now
the
moment
still
and
dread
when
sorcerers
use
their
baleful
power
when
graves
give
up
their
buried
dead
to
profit
by
the
sanctioned
hour
from
guilt
and
guilty
thoughts
secure
to
duty
and
devotion
true
with

pure

thy
gentle

i
woo
good

take
my
thanks
that
still
the
snares
of
vice
i
view
with
scorn
thanks
that
to-night
as
free
from
ill
i
sleep
as
when
i
woke
at
morn
yet
may
not
my
unconscious
breast
harbour
some
guilt
to
me
unknown
some
wish
impure
which
unreprest
you
blush
to
see
and
i
to
own
if
such
there
be
in
gentle

instruct
my

bid
truth
upon
my

deign
to
make

peaceful

away
the
witching

the
nightly
goblin
wanton
fay
the
ghost
in
pain
and
fiend
unblest
let
not
the
tempter
in
mine
ear
pour
lessons
of
unhallowed
joy
let
not
the
night-mare
wandering
near
my
couch
the
calm
of
sleep
destroy
let
not
some
horrid
dream
affright
with
strange
fantastic
forms
mine
eyes
but
rather
bid
some
vision
bright
display
the
bliss
of
yonder
skies
show
me
the
crystal
domes
of
heaven
the
worlds
of
light
where
angels
lie
shew
me
the
lot
to
mortals
given
who
guiltless
live
who
guiltless
die
then
show
me
how
a
seat
to
gain
amidst
those
blissful
realms
of
air
teach
me
to
shun
each
guilty
stain
and
guide
me
to
the
good
and

so
every
morn
and
night
my
voice
to
heaven
the
grateful
strain
shall
raise
in
you
as
guardian

good
angels
and

your
praise
so
will
i
strive
with
zealous
fire
each

will
love
the
lessons
you
inspire
and
prize
the
virtues
you
protect
then
when
at
length
by
high
command
my
body
seeks
the
grave's
repose
when
death
draws
nigh
with
friendly
hand
my
failing
pilgrim
eyes
to
close
pleased
that
my
soul
has
'scaped

i
my
life
resign
and
yield
to
god
my
spirit
back
as
pure
as
when
it
first
was
mine
having
finished
her
usual
devotions
antonia
retired
to
bed
sleep
soon
stole
over
her
senses
and
for
several
hours
she
enjoyed
that
calm
repose
which
innocence
alone
can
know
and
for
which
many
a
monarch
with
pleasure
would
exchange
his
crown
----ah
how
dark
these
long-extended
realms
and
rueful
wastes
where
nought
but
silence
reigns
and
night
dark
night
dark
as
was
chaos
ere
the
infant
sun
was
rolled
together
or
had
tried
its
beams
athwart
the
gloom
profound
the
sickly
taper
by
glimmering
through
thy
low-browed
misty
vaults
furred
round
with
mouldy
damps
and
ropy
slime
lets
fall
a
supernumerary
horror
and
only
serves
to
make
thy
night
more
irksome
blair
returned
undiscovered
to
the
abbey
ambrosio's
mind
was
filled
with
the
most
pleasing
images
he
was
wilfully
blind
to
the
danger
of
exposing
himself
to
antonia's
charms
he
only
remembered
the
pleasure
which
her
society
had
afforded
him
and
rejoiced
in
the
prospect
of
that
pleasure
being
repeated
he
failed
not
to
profit
by
elvira's
indisposition
to
obtain
a
sight
of
her
daughter
every
day
at
first
he
bounded
his
wishes
to
inspire
antonia
with
friendship
but
no
sooner
was
he
convinced
that
she
felt
that
sentiment
in
its
fullest
extent
than
his
aim
became
more
decided
and
his
attentions
assumed
a
warmer
colour
the
innocent
familiarity
with
which
she
treated
him
encouraged
his
desires
grown
used
to
her
modesty
it
no
longer
commanded
the
same
respect
and
awe
he
still
admired
it
but
it
only
made
him
more
anxious
to
deprive
her
of
that
quality
which
formed
her
principal
charm
warmth
of
passion
and
natural
penetration
of
which
latter
unfortunately
both
for
himself
and
antonia
he
possessed
an
ample
share
supplied
a
knowledge
of
the
arts
of
seduction
he
easily
distinguished
the
emotions
which
were
favourable
to
his
designs
and
seized
every
means
with
avidity
of
infusing
corruption
into
antonia's
bosom
this
he
found
no
easy
matter
extreme
simplicity
prevented
her
from
perceiving
the
aim
to
which
the
monk's
insinuations
tended
but
the
excellent
morals
which
she
owed
to
elvira's
care
the
solidity
and
correctness
of
her
understanding
and
a
strong
sense
of
what
was
right
implanted
in
her
heart
by
nature
made
her
feel
that
his
precepts
must
be
faulty
by
a
few
simple
words
she
frequently
overthrew
the
whole
bulk
of
his
sophistical
arguments
and
made
him
conscious
how
weak
they
were
when
opposed
to
virtue
and
truth
on
such
occasion
he
took
refuge
in
his
eloquence
he
overpowered
her
with
a
torrent
of
philosophical
paradoxes
to
which
not
understanding
them
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
reply
and
thus
though
he
did
not
convince
her
that
his
reasoning
was
just
he
at
least
prevented
her
from
discovering
it
to
be
false
he
perceived
that
her
respect
for
his
judgment
augmented
daily
and
doubted
not
with
time
to
bring
her
to
the
point
desired
he
was
not
unconscious
that
his
attempts
were
highly
criminal
he
saw
clearly
the
baseness
of
seducing
the
innocent
girl
but
his
passion
was
too
violent
to
permit
his
abandoning
his
design
he
resolved
to
pursue
it
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
might
he
depended
upon
finding
antonia
in
some
unguarded
moment
and
seeing
no
other
man
admitted
into
her
society
nor
hearing
any
mentioned
either
by
her
or
by
elvira
he
imagined
that
her
young
heart
was
still
unoccupied
while
he
waited
for
the
opportunity
of
satisfying
his
unwarrantable
lust
every
day
increased
his
coldness
for
matilda
not
a
little
was
this
occasioned
by
the
consciousness
of
his
faults
to
her
to
hide
them
from
her
he
was
not
sufficiently
master
of
himself
yet
he
dreaded
lest
in
a
transport
of
jealous
rage
she
should
betray
the
secret
on
which
his
character
and
even
his
life
depended
matilda
could
not
but
remark
his
indifference
he
was
conscious
that
she
remarked
it
and
fearing
her
reproaches
shunned
her
studiously
yet
when
he
could
not
avoid
her
her
mildness
might
have
convinced
him
that
he
had
nothing
to
dread
from
her
resentment
she
had
resumed
the
character
of
the
gentle
interesting
rosario
she
taxed
him
not
with
ingratitude
but
her
eyes
filled
with
involuntary
tears
and
the
soft
melancholy
of
her
countenance
and
voice
uttered
complaints
far
more
touching
than
words
could
have
conveyed
ambrosio
was
not
unmoved
by
her
sorrow
but
unable
to
remove
its
cause
he
forbore
to
show
that
it
affected
him
as
her
conduct
convinced
him
that
he
needed
not
fear
her
vengeance
he
continued
to
neglect
her
and
avoided
her
company
with
care
matilda
saw
that
she
in
vain
attempted
to
regain
his
affections
yet
she
stifled
the
impulse
of
resentment
and
continued
to
treat
her
inconstant
lover
with
her
former
fondness
and
attention
by
degrees
elvira's
constitution
recovered
itself
she
was
no
longer
troubled
with
convulsions
and
antonia
ceased
to
tremble
for
her
mother
ambrosio
beheld
this
reestablishment
with
displeasure
he
saw
that
elvira's
knowledge
of
the
world
would
not
be
the
dupe
of
his
sanctified
demeanour
and
that
she
would
easily
perceive
his
views
upon
her
daughter
he
resolved
therefore
before
she
quitted
her
chamber
to
try
the
extent
of
his
influence
over
the
innocent
antonia
one
evening
when
he
had
found
elvira
almost
perfectly
restored
to
health
he
quitted
her
earlier
than
was
his
usual
custom
not
finding
antonia
in
the
antichamber
he
ventured
to
follow
her
to
her
own
it
was
only
separated
from
her
mother's
by
a
closet
in
which
flora
the
waiting-woman
generally
slept
antonia
sat
upon
a
sopha
with
her
back
towards
the
door
and
read
attentively
she
heard
not
his
approach
till
he
had
seated
himself
by
her
she
started
and
welcomed
him
with
a
look
of
pleasure
then
rising
she
would
have
conducted
him
to
the
sitting-room
but
ambrosio
taking
her
hand
obliged
her
by
gentle
violence
to
resume
her
place
she
complied
without
difficulty
she
knew
not
that
there
was
more
impropriety
in
conversing
with
him
in
one
room
than
another
she
thought
herself
equally
secure
of
his
principles
and
her
own
and
having
replaced
herself
upon
the
sopha
she
began
to
prattle
to
him
with
her
usual
ease
and
vivacity
he
examined
the
book
which
she
had
been
reading
and
had
now
placed
upon
the
table
it
was
the
bible
'how'
said
the
friar
to
himself
'antonia
reads
the
bible
and
is
still
so
ignorant'
but
upon
a
further
inspection
he
found
that
elvira
had
made
exactly
the
same
remark
that
prudent
mother
while
she
admired
the
beauties
of
the
sacred
writings
was
convinced
that
unrestricted
no
reading
more
improper
could
be
permitted
a
young
woman
many
of
the
narratives
can
only
tend
to
excite
ideas
the
worst
calculated
for
a
female
breast
every
thing
is
called
plainly
and
roundly
by
its
name
and
the
annals
of
a
brothel
would
scarcely
furnish
a
greater
choice
of
indecent
expressions
yet
this
is
the
book
which
young
women
are
recommended
to
study
which
is
put
into
the
hands
of
children
able
to
comprehend
little
more
than
those
passages
of
which
they
had
better
remain
ignorant
and
which
but
too
frequently
inculcates
the
first
rudiments
of
vice
and
gives
the
first
alarm
to
the
still
sleeping
passions
of
this
was
elvira
so
fully
convinced
that
she
would
have
preferred
putting
into
her
daughter's
hands
'amadis
de
gaul'
or
'the
valiant
champion
tirante
the
white'
and
would
sooner
have
authorised
her
studying
the
lewd
exploits
of
'don
galaor'
or
the
lascivious
jokes
of
the
'damsel
plazer
di
mi
vida'
she
had
in
consequence
made
two
resolutions
respecting
the
bible
the
first
was
that
antonia
should
not
read
it
till
she
was
of
an
age
to
feel
its
beauties
and
profit
by
its
morality
the
second
that
it
should
be
copied
out
with
her
own
hand
and
all
improper
passages
either
altered
or
omitted
she
had
adhered
to
this
determination
and
such
was
the
bible
which
antonia
was
reading
it
had
been
lately
delivered
to
her
and
she
perused
it
with
an
avidity
with
a
delight
that
was
inexpressible
ambrosio
perceived
his
mistake
and
replaced
the
book
upon
the
table
antonia
spoke
of
her
mother's
health
with
all
the
enthusiastic
joy
of
a
youthful
heart
'i
admire
your
filial
affection'
said
the
abbot
'it
proves
the
excellence
and
sensibility
of
your
character
it
promises
a
treasure
to
him
whom
heaven
has
destined
to
possess
your
affections
the
breast
so
capable
of
fondness
for
a
parent
what
will
it
feel
for
a
lover
nay
perhaps
what
feels
it
for
one
even
now
tell
me
my
lovely
daughter
have
you
known
what
it
is
to
love
answer
me
with
sincerity
forget
my
habit
and
consider
me
only
as
a
friend'
'what
it
is
to
love'
said
she
repeating
his
question
'oh
yes
undoubtedly
i
have
loved
many
many
people'
'that
is
not
what
i
mean
the
love
of
which
i
speak
can
be
felt
only
for
one
have
you
never
seen
the
man
whom
you
wished
to
be
your
husband'
'oh
no
indeed'
this
was
an
untruth
but
she
was
unconscious
of
its
falsehood
she
knew
not
the
nature
of
her
sentiments
for
lorenzo
and
never
having
seen
him
since
his
first
visit
to
elvira
with
every
day
his
image
grew
less
feebly
impressed
upon
her
bosom
besides
she
thought
of
an
husband
with
all
a
virgin's
terror
and
negatived
the
friar's
demand
without
a
moment's
hesitation
'and
do
you
not
long
to
see
that
man
antonia
do
you
feel
no
void
in
your
heart
which
you
fain
would
have
filled
up
do
you
heave
no
sighs
for
the
absence
of
some
one
dear
to
you
but
who
that
some
one
is
you
know
not
perceive
you
not
that
what
formerly
could
please
has
charms
for
you
no
longer
that
a
thousand
new
wishes
new
ideas
new
sensations
have
sprang
in
your
bosom
only
to
be
felt
never
to
be
described
or
while
you
fill
every
other
heart
with
passion
is
it
possible
that
your
own
remains
insensible
and
cold
it
cannot
be
that
melting
eye
that
blushing
cheek
that
enchanting
voluptuous
melancholy
which
at
times
overspreads
your
features
all
these
marks
belye
your
words
you
love
antonia
and
in
vain
would
hide
it
from
me'
'father
you
amaze
me
what
is
this
love
of
which
you
speak
i
neither
know
its
nature
nor
if
i
felt
it
why
i
should
conceal
the
sentiment'
'have
you
seen
no
man
antonia
whom
though
never
seen
before
you
seemed
long
to
have
sought
whose
form
though
a
stranger's
was
familiar
to
your
eyes
the
sound
of
whose
voice
soothed

your

soul
in
whose
presence
you
rejoiced
for
whose
absence
you
lamented
with
whom
your
heart
seemed
to
expand
and
in
whose
bosom
with
confidence
unbounded
you
reposed
the
cares
of
your
own
have
you
not
felt
all
this
antonia'
'certainly
i
have
the
first
time
that
i
saw
you
i
felt
it'
ambrosio
started
scarcely
dared
he
credit
his
hearing
'me
antonia'
he
cried
his
eyes
sparkling
with
delight
and
impatience
while
he
seized
her
hand
and
pressed
it
rapturously
to
his
lips
'me
antonia
you
felt
these
sentiments
for
me'
'even
with
more
strength
than
you
have
described
the
very
moment
that
i
beheld
you
i
felt
so
pleased
so
interested
i
waited
so
eagerly
to
catch
the
sound
of
your
voice
and
when
i
heard
it
it
seemed
so
sweet
it
spoke
to
me
a
language
till
then
so
unknown
methought
it
told
me
a
thousand
things
which
i
wished
to
hear
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
long
known
you
as
if
i
had
a
right
to
your
friendship
your
advice
and
your
protection
i
wept
when
you
departed
and
longed
for
the
time
which
should
restore
you
to
my
sight'
'antonia
my
charming
antonia'
exclaimed
the
monk
and
caught
her
to
his
bosom
'can
i
believe
my
senses
repeat
it
to
me
my
sweet
girl
tell
me
again
that
you
love
me
that
you
love
me
truly
and
tenderly'
'indeed
i
do
let
my
mother
be
excepted
and
the
world
holds
no
one
more
dear
to
me'
at
this
frank
avowal
ambrosio
no
longer
possessed
himself
wild
with
desire
he
clasped
the
blushing
trembler
in
his
arms
he
fastened
his
lips
greedily
upon
hers
sucked
in
her
pure
delicious
breath
violated
with
his
bold
hand
the
treasures
of
her
bosom
and
wound
around
him
her
soft
and
yielding
limbs
startled
alarmed
and
confused
at
his
action
surprize
at
first
deprived
her
of
the
power
of
resistance
at
length
recovering
herself
she
strove
to
escape
from
his
embrace
'father

ambrosio'
she
cried
'release
me
for
god's
sake'
but
the
licentious
monk
heeded
not
her
prayers
he
persisted
in
his
design
and
proceeded
to
take
still
greater
liberties
antonia
prayed
wept
and
struggled
terrified
to
the
extreme
though
at
what
she
knew
not
she
exerted
all
her
strength
to
repulse
the
friar
and
was
on
the
point
of
shrieking
for
assistance
when
the
chamber
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
ambrosio
had
just
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
be
sensible
of
his
danger
reluctantly
he
quitted
his
prey
and
started
hastily
from
the
couch
antonia
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
flew
towards
the
door
and
found
herself
clasped
in
the
arms
of
her
mother
alarmed
at
some
of
the
abbot's
speeches
which
antonia
had
innocently
repeated
elvira
resolved
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
her
suspicions
she
had
known
enough
of
mankind
not
to
be
imposed
upon
by
the
monk's
reputed
virtue
she
reflected
on
several
circumstances
which
though
trifling
on
being
put
together
seemed
to
authorize
her
fears
his
frequent
visits
which
as
far
as
she
could
see
were
confined
to
her
family
his
evident
emotion
whenever
she
spoke
of
antonia
his
being
in
the
full
prime
and
heat
of
manhood
and
above
all
his
pernicious
philosophy
communicated
to
her
by
antonia
and
which
accorded
but
ill
with
his
conversation
in
her
presence
all
these
circumstances
inspired
her
with
doubts
respecting
the
purity
of
ambrosio's
friendship
in
consequence
she
resolved
when
he
should
next
be
alone
with
antonia
to
endeavour
at
surprizing
him
her
plan
had
succeeded
'tis
true
that
when
she
entered
the
room
he
had
already
abandoned
his
prey
but
the
disorder
of
her
daughter's
dress
and
the
shame
and
confusion
stamped
upon
the
friar's
countenance
sufficed
to
prove
that
her
suspicions
were
but
too
well-founded
however
she
was
too
prudent
to
make
those
suspicions
known
she
judged
that
to
unmask
the
imposter
would
be
no
easy
matter
the
public
being
so
much
prejudiced
in
his
favour
and
having
but
few
friends
she
thought
it
dangerous
to
make
herself
so
powerful
an
enemy
she
affected
therefore
not
to
remark
his
agitation
seated
herself
tranquilly
upon
the
sopha
assigned
some
trifling
reason
for
having
quitted
her
room
unexpectedly
and
conversed
on
various
subjects
with
seeming
confidence
and
ease
reassured
by
her
behaviour
the
monk
began
to
recover
himself
he
strove
to
answer
elvira
without
appearing
embarrassed
but
he
was
still
too
great
a
novice
in
dissimulation
and
he
felt
that
he
must
look
confused
and
awkward
he
soon
broke
off
the
conversation
and
rose
to
depart
what
was
his
vexation
when
on
taking
leave
elvira
told
him
in
polite
terms
that
being
now
perfectly
reestablished
she
thought
it
an
injustice
to
deprive
others
of
his
company
who
might
be
more
in
need
of
it
she
assured
him
of
her
eternal
gratitude
for
the
benefit
which
during
her
illness
she
had
derived
from
his
society
and
exhortations
and
she
lamented
that
her
domestic
affairs
as
well
as
the
multitude
of
business
which
his
situation
must
of
necessity
impose
upon
him
would
in
future
deprive
her
of
the
pleasure
of
his
visits
though
delivered
in
the
mildest
language
this
hint
was
too
plain
to
be
mistaken
still
he
was
preparing
to
put
in
a
remonstrance
when
an
expressive
look
from
elvira
stopped
him
short
he
dared
not
press
her
to
receive
him
for
her
manner
convinced
him
that
he
was
discovered
he
submitted
without
reply
took
an
hasty
leave
and
retired
to
the
abbey
his
heart
filled
with
rage
and
shame
with
bitterness
and
disappointment
antonia's
mind
felt
relieved
by
his
departure
yet
she
could
not
help
lamenting
that
she
was
never
to
see
him
more
elvira
also
felt
a
secret
sorrow
she
had
received
too
much
pleasure
from
thinking
him
her
friend
not
to
regret
the
necessity
of
changing
her
opinion
but
her
mind
was
too
much
accustomed
to
the
fallacy
of
worldly
friendships
to
permit
her
present
disappointment
to
weigh
upon
it
long
she
now
endeavoured
to
make
her
daughter
aware
of
the
risque
which
she
had
ran
but
she
was
obliged
to
treat
the
subject
with
caution
lest
in
removing
the
bandage
of
ignorance
the
veil
of
innocence
should
be
rent
away
she
therefore
contented
herself
with
warning
antonia
to
be
upon
her
guard
and
ordering
her
should
the
abbot
persist
in
his
visits
never
to
receive
them
but
in
company
with
this
injunction
antonia
promised
to
comply
ambrosio
hastened
to
his
cell
he
closed
the
door
after
him
and
threw
himself
upon
the
bed
in
despair
the
impulse
of
desire
the
stings
of
disappointment
the
shame
of
detection
and
the
fear
of
being
publicly
unmasked
rendered
his
bosom
a
scene
of
the
most
horrible
confusion
he
knew
not
what
course
to
pursue
debarred
the
presence
of
antonia
he
had
no
hopes
of
satisfying
that
passion
which
was
now
become
a
part
of
his
existence
he
reflected
that
his
secret
was
in
a
woman's
power
he
trembled
with
apprehension
when
he
beheld
the
precipice
before
him
and
with
rage
when
he
thought
that
had
it
not
been
for
elvira
he
should
now
have
possessed
the
object
of
his
desires
with
the
direct
imprecations
he
vowed
vengeance
against
her
he
swore
that
cost
what
it
would
he
still
would
possess
antonia
starting
from
the
bed
he
paced
the
chamber
with
disordered
steps
howled
with
impotent
fury
dashed
himself
violently
against
the
walls
and
indulged
all
the
transports
of
rage
and
madness
he
was
still
under
the
influence
of
this
storm
of
passions
when
he
heard
a
gentle
knock
at
the
door
of
his
cell
conscious
that
his
voice
must
have
been
heard
he
dared
not
refuse
admittance
to
the
importuner
he
strove
to
compose
himself
and
to
hide
his
agitation
having
in
some
degree
succeeded
he
drew
back
the
bolt
the
door
opened
and
matilda
appeared
at
this
precise
moment
there
was
no
one
with
whose
presence
he
could
better
have
dispensed
he
had
not
sufficient
command
over
himself
to
conceal
his
vexation
he
started
back
and
frowned
'i
am
busy'
said
he
in
a
stern
and
hasty
tone
'leave
me'
matilda
heeded
him
not
she
again
fastened
the
door
and
then
advanced
towards
him
with
an
air
gentle
and
supplicating
'forgive
me
ambrosio'
said
she
'for
your
own
sake
i
must
not
obey
you
fear
no
complaints
from
me
i
come
not
to
reproach
you
with
your
ingratitude
i
pardon
you
from
my
heart
and
since
your
love
can
no
longer
be
mine
i
request
the
next
best
gift
your
confidence
and
friendship
we
cannot
force
our
inclinations
the
little
beauty
which
you
once
saw
in
me
has
perished
with
its
novelty
and
if
it
can
no
longer
excite
desire
mine
is
the
fault
not
yours
but
why
persist
in
shunning
me
why
such
anxiety
to
fly
my
presence
you
have
sorrows
but
will
not
permit
me
to
share
them
you
have
disappointments
but
will
not
accept
my
comfort
you
have
wishes
but
forbid
my
aiding
your
pursuits
'tis
of
this
which
i
complain
not
of
your
indifference
to
my
person
i
have
given
up
the
claims
of
the
mistress
but
nothing
shall
prevail
on
me
to
give
up
those
of
the
friend'
her
mildness
had
an
instantaneous
effect
upon
ambrosio's
feelings
'generous
matilda'
he
replied
taking
her
hand
'how
far
do
you
rise
superior
to
the
foibles
of
your
sex
yes
i
accept
your
offer
i
have
need
of
an
adviser
and
a
confident
in
you
i
find
every
needful
quality
united
but
to
aid
my
pursuits

ah
matilda
it
lies
not
in
your
power'
'it
lies
in
no
one's
power
but
mine
ambrosio
your
secret
is
none
to
me
your
every
step
your
every
action
has
been
observed
by
my
attentive
eye
you
love'
'matilda'
'why
conceal
it
from
me
fear
not
the
little
jealousy
which
taints
the
generality
of
women
my
soul
disdains
so
despicable
a
passion

love
ambrosio
antonia
dalfa
is
the
object

your
flame
i
know
every
circumstance
respecting
your
passion

conversation
has
been
repeated
to
me
i
have
been
informed
of
your
attempt
to
enjoy
antonia's
person
your
disappointment
and
dismission
from
elvira's
house
you
now
despair
of
possessing
your
mistress
but
i
come
to
revive
your
hopes
and
point
out
the
road
to
success'
'to
success
oh
impossible'
'to
them
who
dare
nothing
is
impossible
rely
upon
me
and
you
may
yet
be
happy
the
time
is
come
ambrosio
when
regard
for
your
comfort
and
tranquillity
compels
me
to
reveal
a
part
of
my
history
with
which
you
are
still
unacquainted
listen
and
do
not
interrupt
me
should
my
confession
disgust
you
remember
that
in
making
it
my
sole
aim
is
to
satisfy
your
wishes
and
restore
that
peace
to
your
heart
which
at
present
has
abandoned
it
i
formerly
mentioned
that
my
guardian
was
a
man
of
uncommon
knowledge
he
took
pains
to
instil
that
knowledge
into
my
infant
mind
among
the
various
sciences
which
curiosity
had
induced
him
to
explore
he
neglected
not
that
which
by
most
is
esteemed
impious
and
by
many
chimerical
i
speak
of
those
arts
which
relate
to
the
world
of
spirits
his
deep
researches
into
causes
and
effects
his
unwearied
application
to
the
study
of
natural
philosophy
his
profound
and
unlimited
knowledge
of
the
properties
and
virtues
of
every
gem
which
enriches
the
deep
of
every
herb
which
the
earth
produces
at
length
procured
him
the
distinction
which
he
had
sought
so
long
so
earnestly
his
curiosity
was
fully
slaked
his
ambition
amply
gratified
he
gave
laws
to
the
elements
he
could
reverse
the
order
of
nature
his
eye
read
the
mandates
of
futurity
and
the
infernal
spirits
were
submissive
to
his
commands
why
shrink
you
from
me
i
understand
that
enquiring
look
your
suspicions
are
right
though
your
terrors
are
unfounded
my
guardian
concealed
not
from
me
his
most
precious
acquisition
yet
had
i
never
seen
you
i
should
never
have
exerted
my
power
like
you
i
shuddered
at
the
thoughts
of
magic
like
you
i
had
formed
a
terrible
idea
of
the
consequences
of
raising
a
daemon
to
preserve
that
life
which
your
love
had
taught
me
to
prize
i
had
recourse
to
means
which
i
trembled
at
employing
you
remember
that
night
which
i
past
in
st
clare's
sepulchre
then
was
it
that
surrounded
by
mouldering
bodies
i
dared
to
perform
those
mystic
rites
which
summoned
to
my
aid
a
fallen
angel
judge
what
must
have
been
my
joy
at
discovering
that
my
terrors
were
imaginary
i
saw
the
daemon
obedient
to
my
orders
i
saw
him
trembling
at
my
frown
and
found
that
instead
of
selling
my
soul
to
a
master
my
courage
had
purchased
for
myself
a
slave'
'rash
matilda
what
have
you
done
you
have
doomed
yourself
to
endless
perdition
you
have
bartered
for
momentary

happiness

on

depends
the
fruition
of
my
desires

renounce

absolutely

horrible

who
first
seduced
me
to
violate
my
vows
you
who
first
rouzed
my
sleeping
vices
made
me
feel
the
weight
of
religion's
chains
and
bad
me
be
convinced
that
guilt
had
pleasures
yet
though
my
principles
have
yielded
to
the
force
of
temperament
i
still
have
sufficient
grace
to
shudder
at
sorcery
and
avoid
a
crime
so
monstrous
so
unpardonable'
'unpardonable
say
you
where
then
is
your
constant
boast
of
the
almighty's
infinite
mercy
has
he
of
late
set
bounds
to
it

no

ambrosio
you
will
always
have
time
to
repent
and
he
have
goodness
to
forgive
afford
him
a
glorious
opportunity
to
exert
that
goodness
the
greater
your
crime
the
greater

merit
in
pardoning
away
then
with
these
childish
scruples
be
persuaded
to
your
good
and

me
to
the
sepulchre'
'oh
cease
matilda
that
scoffing
tone
that
bold
and
impious
language
is
horrible
in
every
mouth
but
most
so
in
a
woman's
let
us
drop
a
conversation
which
excites
no
other
sentiments
than
horror
and
disgust
i
will
not
follow
you
to
the
sepulchre
or
accept
the
services
of
your
infernal
agents
antonia
shall
be
mine
but
mine
by
human
means'
'then
yours
she
will
never
be
you
are
banished
her
presence
her
mother
has
opened
her
eyes
to
your
designs
and
she
is
now
upon
her
guard
against
them
nay
more
she
loves
another
a
youth
of
distinguished
merit
possesses
her
heart
and
unless
you
interfere
a
few
days
will
make
her
his
bride
this
intelligence
was
brought
me
by
my
invisible
servants
to
whom
i
had
recourse
on
first
perceiving
your
indifference
they
watched
your
every
action
related
to
me
all
that
past
at
elvira's
and
inspired
me
with
the
idea
of
favouring
your
designs
their
reports
have
been
my
only
comfort
though
you
shunned
my
presence
all
your
proceedings
were
known
to
me
nay
i
was
constantly
with
you
in
some
degree
thanks
to
this
precious
gift'
with
these
words
she
drew
from
beneath
her
habit
a
mirror
of
polished
steel
the
borders
of
which
were
marked
with
various
strange
and
unknown
characters
'amidst
all
my
sorrows
amidst
all
my
regrets
for
your
coldness
i
was
sustained
from
despair
by
the
virtues
of
this
talisman
on
pronouncing
certain
words
the
person
appears
in
it
on
whom
the
observer's
thoughts
are
bent
thus
though
i
was
exiled
from
your
sight
you
ambrosio
were
ever
present
to
mine'
the
friar's
curiosity
was
excited
strongly
'what
you
relate
is
incredible
matilda
are
you
not
amusing
yourself
with
my
credulity'
'be
your
own
eyes
the
judge'
she
put
the
mirror
into
his
hand
curiosity
induced
him
to
take
it
and
love
to
wish
that
antonia
might
appear
matilda
pronounced
the
magic
words
immediately
a
thick
smoke
rose
from
the
characters
traced
upon
the
borders
and
spread
itself
over
the
surface
it
dispersed
again
gradually
a
confused
mixture
of
colours
and
images
presented
themselves
to
the
friar's
eyes
which
at
length
arranging
themselves
in
their
proper
places
he
beheld
in
miniature
antonia's
lovely
form
the
scene
was
a
small
closet
belonging
to
her
apartment
she
was
undressing
to
bathe
herself
the
long
tresses
of
her
hair
were
already
bound
up
the
amorous
monk
had
full
opportunity
to
observe
the
voluptuous
contours
and
admirable
symmetry
of
her
person
she
threw
off
her
last
garment
and
advancing
to
the
bath
prepared
for
her
she
put
her
foot
into
the
water
it
struck
cold
and
she
drew
it
back
again
though
unconscious
of
being
observed
an
inbred
sense
of
modesty
induced
her
to
veil
her
charms
and
she
stood
hesitating
upon
the
brink
in
the
attitude
of
the
venus
de
medicis
at
this
moment
a
tame
linnet
flew
towards
her
nestled
its
head
between
her
breasts
and
nibbled
them
in
wanton
play
the
smiling
antonia
strove
in
vain
to
shake
off
the
bird
and
at
length
raised
her
hands
to
drive
it
from
its
delightful
harbour
ambrosio
could
bear
no
more
his
desires
were
worked
up
to
phrenzy
'i
yield'
he
cried
dashing
the
mirror
upon
the
ground
'matilda
i
follow
you
do
with
me
what
you
will'
she
waited
not
to
hear
his
consent
repeated
it
was
already
midnight
she
flew
to
her
cell
and
soon
returned
with
her
little
basket
and
the
key
of
the
cemetery
which
had
remained
in
her
possession
since
her
first
visit
to
the
vaults
she
gave
the
monk
no
time
for
reflection
'come'
she
said
and
took
his
hand
'follow
me
and
witness
the
effects
of
your
resolve'
this
said
she
drew
him
hastily
along
they
passed
into
the
burying-ground
unobserved
opened
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
and
found
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
subterraneous
staircase
as
yet
the
beams
of
the
full
moon
had
guided
their
steps
but
that
resource
now
failed
them
matilda
had
neglected
to
provide
herself
with
a
lamp
still
holding
ambrosio's
hand
she
descended
the
marble
steps
but
the
profound
obscurity
with
which
they
were
overspread
obliged
them
to
walk
slow
and
cautiously
'you
tremble'
said
matilda
to
her
companion
'fear
not
the
destined
spot
is
near'
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
continued
to
proceed
feeling
their
way
along
the
walls
on
turning
a
corner
suddenly
they
descried
faint
gleams
of
light
which
seemed
burning
at
a
distance
thither
they
bent
their
steps
the
rays
proceeded
from
a
small
sepulchral
lamp
which
flamed
unceasingly
before
the
statue
of
st
clare
it
tinged
with
dim
and
cheerless
beams
the
massy
columns
which
supported
the
roof
but
was
too
feeble
to
dissipate
the
thick
gloom
in
which
the
vaults
above
were
buried
matilda
took
the
lamp
'wait
for
me'
said
she
to
the
friar
'in
a
few
moments
i
am
here
again'
with
these
words
she
hastened
into
one
of
the
passages
which
branched
in
various
directions
from
this
spot
and
formed
a
sort
of
labyrinth
ambrosio
was
now
left
alone
darkness
the
most
profound
surrounded
him
and
encouraged
the
doubts
which
began
to
revive
in
his
bosom
he
had
been
hurried
away
by
the
delirium
of
the
moment
the
shame
of
betraying
his
terrors
while
in
matilda's
presence
had
induced
him
to
repress
them
but
now
that
he
was
abandoned
to
himself
they
resumed
their
former
ascendancy
he
trembled
at
the
scene
which
he
was
soon
to
witness
he
knew
not
how
far
the
delusions
of
magic
might
operate
upon
his
mind
and
possibly
might
force
him
to
some
deed
whose
commission
would
make
the
breach
between
himself
and
heaven
irreparable
in
this
fearful
dilemma
he
would
have
implored
god's
assistance
but
was
conscious
that
he
had
forfeited
all
claim
to
such
protection
gladly
would
he
have
returned
to
the
abbey
but
as
he
had
past
through
innumerable
caverns
and
winding
passages
the
attempt
of
regaining
the
stairs
was
hopeless
his
fate
was
determined
no
possibility
of
escape
presented
itself
he
therefore
combated
his
apprehensions
and
called
every
argument
to
his
succour
which
might
enable
him
to
support
the
trying
scene
with
fortitude
he
reflected
that
antonia
would
be
the
reward
of
his
daring
he
inflamed
his
imagination
by
enumerating
her
charms
he
persuaded
himself
that
as
matilda
had
observed
he
always
should
have
time
sufficient
for
repentance
and
that
as
he
employed
her
assistance
not
that
of
the
daemons
the
crime
of
sorcery
could
not
be
laid
to
his
charge
he
had
read
much
respecting
witchcraft
he
understood
that
unless
a
formal
act
was
signed
renouncing
his
claim
to
salvation
satan
would
have
no
power
over
him
he
was
fully
determined
not
to
execute
any
such
act
whatever
threats
might
be
used
or
advantages
held
out
to
him
such
were
his
meditations
while
waiting
for
matilda
they
were
interrupted
by
a
low
murmur
which
seemed
at
no
great
distance
from
him
he
was
startled
he
listened
some
minutes
past
in
silence
after
which
the
murmur
was
repeated
it
appeared
to
be
the
groaning
of
one
in
pain
in
any
other
situation
this
circumstance
would
only
have
excited
his
attention
and
curiosity
in
the
present
his
predominant
sensation
was
that
of
terror
his
imagination
totally
engrossed
by
the
ideas
of
sorcery
and
spirits
he
fancied
that
some
unquiet
ghost
was
wandering
near
him
or
else
that
matilda
had
fallen
a
victim
to
her
presumption
and
was
perishing
under
the
cruel
fangs
of
the
daemons
the
noise
seemed
not
to
approach
but
continued
to
be
heard
at
intervals
sometimes
it
became
more
audible
doubtless
as
the
sufferings
of
the
person
who
uttered
the
groans
became
more
acute
and
insupportable
ambrosio
now
and
then
thought
that
he
could
distinguish
accents
and
once
in
particular
he
was
almost
convinced
that
he
heard
a
faint
voice
exclaim
'god
oh
god
no
hope
no
succour'
yet
deeper
groans
followed
these
words
they
died
away
gradually
and
universal
silence
again
prevailed
'what
can
this
mean'
thought
the
bewildered
monk
at
that
moment
an
idea
which
flashed
into
his
mind
almost
petrified
him
with
horror
he
started
and
shuddered
at
himself
'should
it
be
possible'
he
groaned
involuntarily
'should
it
but
be
possible
oh
what
a
monster
am
i'
he
wished
to
resolve
his
doubts
and
to
repair
his
fault
if
it
were
not
too
late
already
but
these
generous
and
compassionate
sentiments
were
soon
put
to
flight
by
the
return
of
matilda
he
forgot
the
groaning
sufferer
and
remembered
nothing
but
the
danger
and
embarrassment
of
his
own
situation
the
light
of
the
returning
lamp
gilded
the
walls
and
in
a
few
moments
after
matilda
stood
beside
him
she
had
quitted
her
religious
habit
she
was
now
cloathed
in
a
long
sable
robe
on
which
was
traced
in
gold
embroidery
a
variety
of
unknown
characters
it
was
fastened
by
a
girdle
of
precious
stones
in
which
was
fixed
a
poignard
her
neck
and
arms
were
uncovered
in
her
hand
she
bore
a
golden
wand
her
hair
was
loose
and
flowed
wildly
upon
her
shoulders
her
eyes
sparkled
with
terrific
expression
and
her
whole
demeanour
was
calculated
to
inspire
the
beholder
with
awe
and
admiration
'follow
me'
she
said
to
the
monk
in
a
low
and
solemn
voice
'all
is
ready'
his
limbs
trembled
while
he
obeyed
her
she
led
him
through
various
narrow
passages
and
on
every
side
as
they
past
along
the
beams
of
the
lamp
displayed
none
but
the
most
revolting
objects
skulls
bones
graves
and
images
whose
eyes
seemed
to
glare
on
them
with
horror
and
surprize
at
length
they
reached
a
spacious
cavern
whose
lofty
roof
the
eye
sought
in
vain
to
discover
a
profound
obscurity
hovered
through
the
void
damp
vapours
struck
cold
to
the
friar's
heart
and
he
listened
sadly
to
the
blast
while
it
howled
along
the
lonely
vaults
here
matilda
stopped
she
turned
to
ambrosio
his
cheeks
and
lips
were
pale
with
apprehension
by
a
glance
of
mingled
scorn
and
anger
she
reproved
his
pusillanimity
but
she
spoke
not
she
placed
the
lamp
upon
the
ground
near
the
basket
she
motioned
that
ambrosio
should
be
silent
and
began
the
mysterious
rites
she
drew
a
circle
round
him
another
round
herself
and
then
taking
a
small
phial
from
the
basket
poured
a
few
drops
upon
the
ground
before
her
she
bent
over
the
place
muttered
some
indistinct
sentences
and
immediately
a
pale
sulphurous
flame
arose
from
the
ground
it
increased
by
degrees
and
at
length
spread
its
waves
over
the
whole
surface
the
circles
alone
excepted
in
which
stood
matilda
and
the
monk
it
then
ascended
the
huge
columns
of
unhewn
stone
glided
along
the
roof
and
formed
the
cavern
into
an
immense
chamber
totally
covered
with
blue
trembling
fire
it
emitted
no
heat
on
the
contrary
the
extreme
chillness
of
the
place
seemed
to
augment
with
every
moment
matilda
continued
her
incantations
at
intervals
she
took
various
articles
from
the
basket
the
nature
and
name
of
most
of
which
were
unknown
to
the
friar
but
among
the
few
which
he
distinguished
he
particularly
observed
three
human
fingers
and
an
agnus
dei
which
she
broke
in
pieces
she
threw
them
all
into
the
flames
which
burned
before
her
and
they
were
instantly
consumed
the
monk
beheld
her
with
anxious
curiosity
suddenly
she
uttered
a
loud
and
piercing
shriek
she
appeared
to
be
seized
with
an
access
of
delirium
she
tore
her
hair
beat
her
bosom
used
the
most
frantic
gestures
and
drawing
the
poignard
from
her
girdle
plunged
it
into
her
left
arm
the
blood
gushed
out
plentifully
and
as
she
stood
on
the
brink
of
the
circle
she
took
care
that
it
should
fall
on
the
outside
the
flames
retired
from
the
spot
on
which
the
blood
was
pouring
a
volume
of
dark
clouds
rose
slowly
from
the
ensanguined
earth
and
ascended
gradually
till
it
reached
the
vault
of
the
cavern
at
the
same
time
a
clap
of
thunder
was
heard
the
echo
pealed
fearfully
along
the
subterraneous
passages
and
the
ground
shook
beneath
the
feet
of
the
enchantress
it
was
now
that
ambrosio
repented
of
his
rashness
the
solemn
singularity
of
the
charm
had
prepared
him
for
something
strange
and
horrible
he
waited
with
fear
for
the
spirit's
appearance
whose
coming
was
announced
by
thunder
and
earthquakes
he
looked
wildly
round
him
expecting
that
some
dreadful
apparition
would
meet
his
eyes
the
sight
of
which
would
drive
him
mad
a
cold
shivering
seized
his
body
and
he
sank
upon
one
knee
unable
to
support
himself
'he
comes'
exclaimed
matilda
in
a
joyful
accent
ambrosio
started
and
expected
the
daemon
with
terror
what
was
his
surprize
when
the
thunder
ceasing
to
roll
a
full
strain
of
melodious
music
sounded
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
the
cloud
dispersed
and
he
beheld
a
figure
more
beautiful
than
fancy's
pencil
ever
drew
it
was
a
youth
seemingly
scarce
eighteen
the
perfection
of
whose
form
and
face
was
unrivalled
he
was
perfectly
naked
a
bright
star
sparkled
upon
his
forehead
two
crimson
wings
extended
themselves
from
his
shoulders
and
his
silken
locks
were
confined
by
a
band
of
many-coloured
fires
which
played
round
his
head
formed
themselves
into
a
variety
of
figures
and
shone
with
a
brilliance
far
surpassing
that
of
precious
stones
circlets
of
diamonds
were
fastened
round
his
arms
and
ankles
and
in
his
right
hand
he
bore
a
silver
branch
imitating
myrtle
his
form
shone
with
dazzling
glory
he
was
surrounded
by
clouds
of
rose-coloured
light
and
at
the
moment
that
he
appeared
a
refreshing
air
breathed
perfumes
through
the
cavern
enchanted
at
a
vision
so
contrary
to
his
expectations
ambrosio
gazed
upon
the
spirit
with
delight
and
wonder
yet
however
beautiful
the
figure
he
could
not
but
remark
a
wildness
in
the
daemon's
eyes
and
a
mysterious
melancholy
impressed
upon
his
features
betraying
the
fallen
angel
and
inspiring
the
spectators
with
secret
awe
the
music
ceased
matilda
addressed
herself
to
the
spirit
she
spoke
in
a
language
unintelligible
to
the
monk
and
was
answered
in
the
same
she
seemed
to
insist
upon
something
which
the
daemon
was
unwilling
to
grant
he
frequently
darted
upon
ambrosio
angry
glances
and
at
such
times
the
friar's
heart
sank
within
him
matilda
appeared
to
grow
incensed
she
spoke
in
a
loud
and
commanding
tone
and
her
gestures
declared
that
she
was
threatening
him
with
her
vengeance
her
menaces
had
the
desired
effect
the
spirit
sank
upon
his
knee
and
with
a
submissive
air
presented
to
her
the
branch
of
myrtle
no
sooner
had
she
received
it
than
the
music
was
again
heard
a
thick
cloud
spread
itself
over
the
apparition
the
blue
flames
disappeared
and
total
obscurity
reigned
through
the
cave
the
abbot
moved
not
from
his
place
his
faculties
were
all
bound
up
in
pleasure
anxiety
and
surprize
at
length
the
darkness
dispersing
he
perceived
matilda
standing
near
him
in
her
religious
habit
with
the
myrtle
in
her
hand
no
traces
of
the
incantation
and
the
vaults
were
only
illuminated

this
you

the
abbot
received
the
talisman
with
silent
gratitude
his
ideas
were
too
much
bewildered
by
the
adventures
of
the
night
to
permit
his
expressing
his
thanks
audibly
or
indeed
as
yet
to
feel
the
whole
value
of
her
present
matilda
took
up
her
lamp
and
basket
and
guided
her
companion
from
the
mysterious
cavern
she
restored
the
lamp
to
its
former
place
and
continued
her
route
in
darkness
till
she
reached
the
foot
of
the
staircase
the

of
the
rising

darting

facilitated
the
ascent
matilda
and
the
abbot
hastened
out
of
the
sepulchre
closed
the
door
after
them
and
soon
regained
the
abbey's
western
cloister
no
one
met
them
and
they
retired
unobserved
to
their
respective
cells
the
confusion
of
ambrosio's
mind
now
began
to
appease
he
rejoiced
in
the
fortunate
issue
of
his
adventure
and
reflecting
upon
the
virtues
of
the
myrtle
looked
upon
antonia
as
already
in

imagination
retraced
to
him
those

betrayed

all
the

proved
vain
agnes
was
lost
to
him
for
ever
despair
produced
so
violent
an
effect
upon
his
constitution
that
the
consequence
was
a
long
and
severe
illness
this
prevented
him
from
visiting
elvira
as
he
had
intended
and
she
being
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
his
neglect
it
gave
her
no
trifling
uneasiness
his
sister's
death
had
prevented
lorenzo
from
communicating
to
his
uncle
his
designs
respecting
antonia
the
injunctions
of
her
mother
forbad
his
presenting
himself
to
her
without
the
duke's
consent
and
as
she
heard
no
more
of
him
or
his
proposals
elvira
conjectured
that
he
had
either
met
with
a
better
match
or
had
been
commanded
to
give
up
all
thoughts
of
her
daughter
every
day
made
her
more
uneasy
respecting
antonia's
fate
while
she
retained
the
abbot's
protection
she
bore
with
fortitude
the
disappointment
of
her
hopes
with
regard
to
lorenzo
and
the
marquis
that
resource
now
failed
her
she
was
convinced
that
ambrosio
had
meditated
her
daughter's
ruin
and
when
she
reflected
that
her
death
would
leave
antonia
friendless
and
unprotected
in
a
world
so
base
so
perfidious
and
depraved
her
heart
swelled
with
the
bitterness
of
apprehension
at
such
times
she
would
sit
for
hours
gazing
upon
the
lovely
girl
and
seeming
to
listen
to
her
innocent
prattle
while
in
reality
her
thoughts
dwelt
upon
the
sorrows
into
which
a
moment
would
suffice
to
plunge
her
then
she
would
clasp
her
in
her
arms
suddenly
lean
her
head
upon
her
daughter's
bosom
and
bedew
it
with
her
tears
an
event
was
in
preparation
which
had
she
known
it
would
have
relieved
her
from
her
inquietude
lorenzo
now
waited
only
for
a
favourable
opportunity
to
inform
the
duke
of
his
intended
marriage
however
a
circumstance
which
occurred
at
this
period
obliged
him
to
delay
his
explanation
for
a
few
days
longer
don
raymond's
malady
seemed
to
gain
ground
lorenzo
was
constantly
at
his
bedside
and
treated
him
with
a
tenderness
truly
fraternal
both
the
cause
and
effects
of
the
disorder
were
highly
afflicting
to
the
brother
of
agnes
yet
theodore's
grief
was
scarcely
less
sincere
that
amiable
boy
quitted
not
his
master
for
a
moment
and
put
every
means
in
practice
to
console
and
alleviate
his
sufferings
the
marquis
had
conceived
so
rooted
an
affection
for
his
deceased
mistress
that
it
was
evident
to
all
that
he
never
could
survive
her
loss
nothing
could
have
prevented
him
from
sinking
under
his
grief
but
the
persuasion
of
her
being
still
alive
and
in
need
of
his
assistance
though
convinced
of
its
falsehood
his
attendants
encouraged
him
in
a
belief
which
formed
his
only
comfort
he
was
assured
daily
that
fresh
perquisitions
were
making
respecting
the
fate
of
agnes
stories
were
invented
recounting
the
various
attempts
made
to
get
admittance
into
the
convent
and
circumstances
were
related
which
though
they
did
not
promise
her
absolute
recovery
at
least
were
sufficient
to
keep
his
hopes
alive
the
marquis
constantly
fell
into
the
most
terrible
excess
of
passion
when
informed
of
the
failure
of
these
supposed
attempts
still
he
would
not
credit
that
the
succeeding
ones
would
have
the
same
fate
but
flattered
himself
that
the
next
would
prove
more
fortunate
theodore
was
the
only
one
who
exerted
himself
to
realize
his
master's
chimoeras
he
was
eternally
busied
in
planning
schemes
for
entering
the
convent
or
at
least
of
obtaining
from
the
nuns
some
intelligence
of
agnes
to
execute
these
schemes
was
the
only
inducement
which
could
prevail
on
him
to
quit
don
raymond
he
became
a
very
proteus
changing
his
shape
every
day
but
all
his
metamorphoses
were
to
very
little
purpose
he
regularly
returned
to
the
palace
de
las
cisternas
without
any
intelligence
to
confirm
his
master's
hopes
one
day
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
disguise
himself
as
a
beggar
he
put
a
patch
over
his
left
eye
took
his
guitar
in
hand
and
posted
himself
at
the
gate
of
the
convent
'if
agnes
is
really
confined
in
the
convent'
thought
he
'and
hears
my
voice
she
will
recollect
it
and
possibly
may
find
means
to
let
me
know
that
she
is
here'
with
this
idea
he
mingled
with
a
crowd
of
beggars
who
assembled
daily
at
the
gate
of
st
clare
to
receive
soup
which
the
nuns
were
accustomed
to
distribute
at
twelve
o'clock
all
were
provided
with
jugs
or
bowls
to
carry
it
away
but
as
theodore
had
no
utensil
of
this
kind
he
begged
leave
to
eat
his
portion
at
the
convent
door
this
was
granted
without
difficulty
his
sweet
voice
and
in
spite
of
his
patched
eye
his
engaging
countenance
won
the
heart
of
the
good
old
porteress
who
aided
by
a
lay-sister
was
busied
in
serving
to
each
his
mess
theodore
was
bad
to
stay
till
the
others
should
depart
and
promised
that
his
request
should
then
be
granted
the
youth
desired
no
better
since
it
was
not
to
eat
soup
that
he
presented
himself
at
the
convent
he
thanked
the
porteress
for
her
permission
retired
from
the
door
and
seating
himself
upon
a
large
stone
amused
himself
in
tuning
his
guitar
while
the
beggars
were
served
as
soon
as
the
crowd
was
gone
theodore
was
beckoned
to
the
gate
and
desired
to
come
in
he
obeyed
with
infinite
readiness
but
affected
great
respect
at
passing
the
hallowed
threshold
and
to
be
much
daunted
by
the
presence
of
the
reverend
ladies
his
feigned
timidity
flattered
the
vanity
of
the
nuns
who
endeavoured
to
reassure
him
the
porteress
took
him
into
her
awn
little
parlour
in
the
meanwhile
the
lay-sister
went
to
the
kitchen
and
soon
returned
with
a
double
portion
of
soup
of
better
quality
than
what
was
given
to
the
beggars
his
hostess
added
some
fruits
and
confections
from
her
own
private
store
and
both
encouraged
the
youth
to
dine
heartily
to
all
these
attentions
he
replied
with
much
seeming
gratitude
and
abundance
of
blessings
upon
his
benefactresses
while
he
ate
the
nuns
admired
the
delicacy
of
his
features
the
beauty
of
his
hair
and
the
sweetness
and
grace
which
accompanied
all
his
actions
they
lamented
to
each
other
in
whispers
that
so
charming
a
youth
should
be
exposed
to
the
seductions
of
the
world
and
agreed
that
he
would
be
a
worthy
pillar
of
the
catholic
church
they
concluded
their
conference
by
resolving
that
heaven
would
be
rendered
a
real
service
if
they
entreated
the
prioress
to
intercede
with
ambrosio
for
the
beggar's
admission
into
the
order
of
capuchins
this
being
determined
the
porteress
who
was
a
person
of
great
influence
in
the
convent
posted
away
in
all
haste
to
the
domina's
cell
here
she
made
so
flaming
a
narrative
of
theodore's
merits
that
the
old
lady
grew
curious
to
see
him
accordingly
the
porteress
was
commissioned
to
convey
him
to
the
parlour
grate
in
the
interim
the
supposed
beggar
was
sifting
the
lay-sister
with
respect
to
the
fate
of
agnes
her
evidence
only
corroborated
the
domina's
assertions
she
said
that
agnes
had
been
taken
ill
on
returning
from
confession
had
never
quitted
her
bed
from
that
moment
and
that
she
had
herself
been
present
at
the
funeral
she
even
attested
having
seen
her
dead
body
and
assisted
with
her
own
hands
in
adjusting
it
upon
the
bier
this
account
discouraged
theodore
yet
as
he
had
pushed
the
adventure
so
far
he
resolved
to
witness
its
conclusion
the
porteress
now
returned
and
ordered
him
to
follow
her
he
obeyed
and
was
conducted
into
the
parlour
where
the
lady
prioress
was
already
posted
at
the
grate
the
nuns
surrounded
her
who
all
flocked
with
eagerness
to
a
scene
which
promised
some
diversion
theodore
saluted
them
with
profound
respect
and
his
presence
had
the
power
to
smooth
for
a
moment
even
the
stern
brow
of
the
superior
she
asked
several
questions
respecting
his
parents
his
religion
and
what
had
reduced
him
to
a
state
of
beggary
to
these
demands
his
answers
were
perfectly
satisfactory
and
perfectly
false
he
was
then
asked
his
opinion
of
a
monastic
life
he
replied
in
terms
of
high
estimation
and
respect
for
it
upon
this
the
prioress
told
him
that
his
obtaining
an
entrance
into
a
religious
order
was
not
impossible
that
her
recommendation
would
not
permit
his
poverty
to
be
an
obstacle
and
that
if
she
found
him
deserving
it
he
might
depend
in
future
upon
her
protection
theodore
assured
her
that
to
merit
her
favour
would
be
his
highest
ambition
and
having
ordered
him
to
return
next
day
when
she
would
talk
with
him
further
the
domina
quitted
the
parlour
the
nuns
whom
respect
for
the
superior
had
till
then
kept
silent
now
crowded
all
together
to
the
grate
and
assailed
the
youth
with
a
multitude
of
questions
he
had
already
examined
each
with
attention
alas
agnes
was
not
amongst
them
the
nuns
heaped
question
upon
question
so
thickly
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
for
him
to
reply
one
asked
where
he
was
born
since
his
accent
declared
him
to
be
a
foreigner
another
wanted
to
know
why
he
wore
a
patch
upon
his
left
eye
sister
helena
enquired
whether
he
had
not
a
sister
like
him
because
she
should
like
such
a
companion
and
sister
rachael
was
fully
persuaded
that
the
brother
would
be
the
pleasanter
companion
of
the
two
theodore
amused
himself
with
retailing
to
the
credulous
nuns
for
truths
all
the
strange
stories
which
his
imagination
could
invent
he
related
to
them
his
supposed
adventures
and
penetrated
every
auditor
with
astonishment
while
he
talked
of
giants
savages
ship-wrecks
and
islands
inhabited
'by
anthropophagi
and
men
whose
heads
do
grow
beneath
their
shoulders'
with
many
other
circumstances
to
the
full
as
remarkable
he
said
that
he
was
born
in
terra
incognita
was
educated
at
an
hottentot
university
and
had
past
two
years
among
the
americans
of
silesia
'for
what
regards
the
loss
of
my
eye'
said
he
'it
was
a
just
punishment
upon
me
for
disrespect
to
the
virgin
when
i
made
my
second
pilgrimage
to
loretto
i
stood
near
the
altar
in
the
miraculous
chapel
the
monks
were
proceeding
to
array
the
statue
in
her
best
apparel
the
pilgrims
were
ordered
to
close
their
eyes
during
this
ceremony
but
though
by
nature
extremely
religious
curiosity
was
too
powerful
at
the
moment

i
shall
penetrate
you
with
horror
reverend
ladies
when
i
reveal
my
crime

at
the
moment
that
the
monks
were
changing
her
shift
i
ventured
to
open
my
left
eye
and
gave
a
little
peep
towards
the
statue
that
look
was
my
last
the
glory
which
surrounded
the
virgin
was
too
great
to
be
supported
i
hastily
shut
my
sacrilegious
eye
and
never
have
been
able
to
unclose
it
since'
at
the
relation
of
this
miracle
the
nuns
all
crossed
themselves
and
promised
to
intercede
with
the
blessed
virgin
for
the
recovery
of
his
sight
they
expressed
their
wonder
at
the
extent
of
his
travels
and
at
the
strange
adventures
which
he
had
met
with
at
so
early
an
age
they
now
remarked
his
guitar
and
enquired
whether
he
was
an
adept
in
music
he
replied
with
modesty
that
it
was
not
for
him
to
decide
upon
his
talents
but
requested
permission
to
appeal
to
them
as
judges
this
was
granted
without
difficulty
'but
at
least'
said
the
old
porteress
'take
care
not
to
sing
any
thing
profane'
'you
may
depend
upon
my
discretion'
replied
theodore
'you
shall
hear
how
dangerous
it
is
for
young
women
to
abandon
themselves
to
their
passions
illustrated
by
the
adventure
of
a
damsel
who
fell
suddenly
in
love
with
an
unknown
knight'
'but
is
the
adventure
true'
enquired
the
porteress
'every
word
of
it
it
happened
in
denmark
and
the
heroine
was
thought
so
beautiful
that
she
was
known
by
no
other
name
but
that
of
the
lovely
maid'
'in
denmark
say
you'
mumbled
an
old
nun
'are
not
the
people
all
blacks
in
denmark'
'by
no
means
reverend
lady
they
are
of
a
delicate
pea-green
with
flame-coloured
hair
and
whiskers'
'mother
of
god
pea-green'
exclaimed
sister
helena
'oh
'tis
impossible'
'impossible'
said
the
porteress
with
a
look
of
contempt
and
exultation
'not
at
all
when
i
was
a
young
woman
i
remember
seeing
several
of
them
myself'
theodore
now
put
his
instrument
in
proper
order
he
had
read
the
story
of
a
king
of
england
whose
prison
was
discovered
by
a
minstrel
and
he
hoped
that
the
same
scheme
would
enable
him
to
discover
agnes
should
she
be
in
the
convent
he
chose
a
ballad
which
she
had
taught
him
herself
in
the
castle
of
lindenberg
she
might
possibly
catch
the
sound
and
he
hoped
to
hear
her
replying
to
some
of
the
stanzas
his
guitar
was
now
in
tune
and
he
prepared
to
strike
it
'but
before
i
begin'
said
he
'it
is
necessary
to
inform
you
ladies
that
this
same
denmark
is
terribly
infested
by
sorcerers
witches
and
evil
spirits
every
element
possesses
its
appropriate
daemons
the
woods
are
haunted
by
a
malignant
power
called
the
erl-
or
oak-king
he
it
is
who
blights
the
trees
spoils
the
harvest
and
commands
the
imps
and
goblins
he
appears
in
the
form
of
an
old
man
of
majestic
figure
with
a
golden
crown
and
long
white
beard
his
principal
amusement
is
to
entice
young
children
from
their
parents
and
as
soon
as
he
gets
them
into
his
cave
he
tears
them
into
a
thousand
pieces--the
rivers
are
governed
by
another
fiend
called
the
water-king
his
province
is
to
agitate
the
deep
occasion
ship-wrecks
and
drag
the
drowning
sailors
beneath
the
waves
he
wears
the
appearance
of
a
warrior
and
employs
himself
in
luring
young
virgins
into
his
snare
what
he
does
with
them
when
he
catches
them
in
the
water
reverend
ladies
i
leave
for
you
to
imagine--the
fire-king
seems
to
be
a
man
all
formed
of
flames
he
raises
the
meteors
and
wandering
lights
which
beguile
travellers
into
ponds
and
marshes
and
he
directs
the
lightning
where
it
may
do
most
mischief--the
last
of
these
elementary
daemons
is
called
the
cloud-king
his
figure
is
that
of
a
beautiful
youth
and
he
is
distinguished
by
two
large
sable
wings
though
his
outside
is
so
enchanting
he
is
not
a
bit
better
disposed
than
the
others
he
is
continually
employed
in
raising
storms
tearing
up
forests
by
the
roots
and
blowing
castles
and
convents
about
the
ears
of
their
inhabitants
the
first
has
a
daughter
who
is
queen
of
the
elves
and
fairies
the
second
has
a
mother
who
is
a
powerful
enchantress
neither
of
these
ladies
are
worth
more
than
the
gentlemen
i
do
not
remember
to
have
heard
any
family
assigned
to
the
two
other
daemons
but
at
present
i
have
no
business
with
any
of
them
except
the
fiend
of
the
waters
he
is
the
hero
of
my
ballad
but
i
thought
it
necessary
before
i
began
to
give
you
some
account
of
his
proceedings--'
theodore
then
played
a
short
symphony
after
which
stretching
his
voice
to
its
utmost
extent
to
facilitate
its
reaching
the
ear
of
agnes
he
sang
the
following
stanzas
the
water-king
a
danish
ballad
with
gentle
murmur
flowed
the
tide
while
by
the
fragrant
flowery
side
the
lovely
maid
with
carols
gay
to
mary's
church
pursued
her
way
the
water-fiend's
malignant
eye
along
the
banks
beheld
her
hie
straight
to
his
mother-witch
he
sped
and
thus
in
suppliant
accents
said
'oh
mother
mother
now
advise
how
i
may
yonder
maid
surprize
oh
mother
mother
now
explain
how
i
may
yonder
maid
obtain'
the
witch
she
gave
him
armour
white
she
formed
him
like
a
gallant
knight
of
water
clear
next
made
her
hand
a
steed
whose
housings
were
of
sand
the
water-king
then
swift
he
went
to
mary's
church
his
steps
he
bent
he
bound
his
courser
to
the
door
and
paced
the
church-yard
three
times
four
his
courser
to
the
door
bound
he
and
paced
the
church-yard
four
time
three
then
hastened
up
the
aisle
where
all
the
people
flocked
both
great
and
small
the
priest
said
as
the
knight
drew
near
'and
wherefore
comes
the
white
chief
here'
the
lovely
maid
she
smiled
aside
'oh
would
i
were
the
white
chief's
bride'
he
stept
o'er
benches
one
and
two
'oh
lovely
maid
i
die
for
you'
he
stept
o'er
benches
two
and
three
'oh
lovely
maiden
go
with
me'
then
sweet
she
smiled
the
lovely
maid
and
while
she
gave
her
hand
she
said
'betide
me
joy
betide
me
woe
o'er
hill
o'er
dale
with
thee
i
go'
the
priest
their
hands
together
joins
they
dance
while
clear
the
moon-beam
shines
and
little
thinks
the
maiden
bright
her
partner
is
the
water-spright
oh
had
some
spirit
deigned
to
sing
'your
partner
is
the
water-king'
the
maid
had
fear
and
hate
confest
and
cursed
the
hand
which
then
she
prest
but
nothing
giving
cause
to
think
how
near
she
strayed
to
danger's
brink
still
on
she
went
and
hand
in
hand
the
lovers
reached
the
yellow
sand
'ascend
this
steed
with
me
my
dear
we
needs
must
cross
the
streamlet
here
ride
boldly
in
it
is
not
deep
the
winds
are
hushed
the
billows
sleep'
thus
spoke
the
water-king
the
maid
her
traitor-bride-groom's
wish
obeyed
and
soon
she
saw
the
courser
lave
delighted
in
his
parent
wave
'stop
stop
my
love
the
waters
blue
e'en
now
my
shrinking
foot
bedew'
'oh
lay
aside
your
fears
sweet
heart
we
now
have
reached
the
deepest
part'
'stop
stop
my
love
for
now
i
see
the
waters
rise
above
my
knee'
'oh
lay
aside
your
fears
sweet
heart
we
now
have
reached
the
deepest
part'
'stop
stop
for
god's
sake
stop
for
oh
the
waters
o'er
my
bosom
flow'--
scarce
was
the
word
pronounced
when
knight
and
courser
vanished
from
her
sight
she
shrieks
but
shrieks
in
vain
for
high
the
wild
winds
rising
dull
the
cry
the
fiend
exults
the
billows
dash
and
o'er
their
hapless
victim
wash
three
times
while
struggling
with
the
stream
the
lovely
maid
was
heard
to
scream
but
when
the
tempest's
rage
was
o'er
the
lovely
maid
was
seen
no
more
warned
by
this
tale
ye
damsels
fair
to
whom
you
give
your
love
beware
believe
not
every
handsome
knight
and
dance
not
with
the
water-spright
the
youth
ceased
to
sing
the
nuns
were
delighted
with
the
sweetness
of
his
voice
and
masterly
manner
of
touching
the
instrument
but
however
acceptable
this
applause
would
have
been
at
any
other
time
at
present
it
was
insipid
to
theodore
his
artifice
had
not
succeeded
he
paused
in
vain
between
the
stanzas
no
voice
replied
to
his
and
he
abandoned
the
hope
of
equalling
blondel
the
convent
bell
now
warned
the
nuns
that
it
was
time
to
assemble
in
the
refectory
they
were
obliged
to
quit
the
grate
they
thanked
the
youth
for
the
entertainment
which
his
music
had
afforded
them
and
charged
him
to
return
the
next
day
this
he
promised
the
nuns
to
give
him
the
greater
inclination
to
keep
his
word
told
him
that
he
might
always
depend
upon
the
convent
for
his
meals
and
each
of
them
made
him
some
little
present
one
gave
him
a
box
of
sweetmeats
another
an
agnus
dei
some
brought
reliques
of
saints
waxen
images
and
consecrated
crosses
and
others
presented
him
with
pieces
of
those
works
in
which
the
religious
excel
such
as
embroidery
artificial
flowers
lace
and
needlework
all
these
he
was
advised
to
sell
in
order
to
put
himself
into
better
case
and
he
was
assured
that
it
would
be
easy
to
dispose
of
them
since
the
spaniards
hold
the
performances
of
the
nuns
in
high
estimation
having
received
these
gifts
with
seeming
respect
and
gratitude
he
remarked
that
having
no
basket
he
knew
not
how
to
convey
them
away
several
of
the
nuns
were
hastening
in
search
of
one
when
they
were
stopped
by
the
return
of
an
elderly
woman
whom
theodore
had
not
till
then
observed
her
mild
countenance
and
respectable
air
prejudiced
him
immediately
in
her
favour
'hah'
said
the
porteress
'here
comes
the
mother
st
ursula
with
a
basket'
the
nun
approached
the
grate
and
presented
the
basket
to
theodore
it
was
of
willow
lined
with
blue
satin
and
upon
the
four
sides
were
painted
scenes
from
the
legend
of
st
genevieve
'here
is
my
gift'
said
she
as
she
gave
it
into
his
hand
'good
youth
despise
it
not
though
its
value
seems
insignificant
it
has
many
hidden
virtues'
she
accompanied
these
words
with
an
expressive
look
it
was
not
lost
upon
theodore
in
receiving
the
present
he
drew
as
near
the
grate
as
possible
'agnes'
she
whispered
in
a
voice
scarcely
intelligible
theodore
however
caught
the
sound
he
concluded
that
some
mystery
was
concealed
in
the
basket
and
his
heart
beat
with
impatience
and
joy
at
this
moment
the
domina
returned
her
air
was
gloomy
and
frowning
and
she
looked
if
possible
more
stern
than
ever
'mother
st
ursula
i
would
speak
with
you
in
private'
the
nun
changed
colour
and
was
evidently
disconcerted
'with
me'
she
replied
in
a
faltering
voice
the
domina
motioned
that
she
must
follow
her
and
retired
the
mother
st
ursula
obeyed
her
soon
after
the
refectory
bell
ringing
a
second
time
the
nuns
quitted
the
grate
and
theodore
was
left
at
liberty
to
carry
off
his
prize
delighted
that
at
length
he
had
obtained
some
intelligence
for
the
marquis
he
flew
rather
than
ran
till
he
reached
the
hotel
de
las
cisternas
in
a
few
minutes
he
stood
by
his
master's
bed
with
the
basket
in
his
hand
lorenzo
was
in
the
chamber
endeavouring
to
reconcile
his
friend
to
a
misfortune
which
he
felt
himself
but
too
severely
theodore
related
his
adventure
and
the
hopes
which
had
been
created
by
the
mother
st
ursula's
gift
the
marquis
started
from
his
pillow
that
fire
which
since
the
death
of
agnes
had
been
extinguished
now
revived
in
his
bosom
and
his
eyes
sparkled
with
the
eagerness
of
expectation
the
emotions
which
lorenzo's
countenance
betrayed
were
scarcely
weaker
and
he
waited
with
inexpressible
impatience
for
the
solution
of
this
mystery
raymond
caught
the
basket
from
the
hands
of
his
page
he
emptied
the
contents
upon
the
bed
and
examined
them
with
minute
attention
he
hoped
that
a
letter
would
be
found
at
the
bottom
nothing
of
the
kind
appeared
the
search
was
resumed
and
still
with
no
better
success
at
length
don
raymond
observed
that
one
corner
of
the
blue
satin
lining
was
unripped
he
tore
it
open
hastily
and
drew
forth
a
small
scrap
of
paper
neither
folded
or
sealed
it
was
addressed
to
the
marquis
de
las
cisternas
and
the
contents
were
as
follows
having
recognised
your
page
i
venture
to
send
these
few
lines
procure
an
order
from
the
cardinal-duke
for
seizing
my
person
and
that
of
the
domina
but
let
it
not
be
executed
till
friday
at
midnight
it
is
the
festival
of
st
clare
there
will
be
a
procession
of
nuns
by
torch-light
and
i
shall
be
among
them
beware
not
to
let
your
intention
be
known
should
a
syllable
be
dropt
to
excite
the
domina's
suspicions
you
will
never
hear
of
me
more
be
cautious
if
you
prize
the
memory
of
agnes
and
wish
to
punish
her
assassins
i
have
that
to
tell
will
freeze
your
blood
with
horror
st
ursula
no
sooner
had
the
marquis
read
the
note
than
he
fell
back
upon
his
pillow
deprived
of
sense
or
motion
the
hope
failed
him
which
till
now
had
supported
his
existence
and
these
lines
convinced
him
but
too
positively
that
agnes
was
indeed
no
more
lorenzo
felt
this
circumstance
less
forcibly
since
it
had
always
been
his
idea
that
his
sister
had
perished
by
unfair
means
when
he
found
by
the
mother
st
ursula's
letter
how
true
were
his
suspicions
the
confirmation
excited
no
other
sentiment
in
his
bosom
than
a
wish
to
punish
the
murderers
as
they
deserved
it
was
no
easy
task
to
recall
the
marquis
to
himself
as
soon
as
he
recovered
his
speech
he
broke
out
into
execrations
against
the
assassins
of
his
beloved
and
vowed
to
take
upon
them
a
signal
vengeance
he
continued
to
rave
and
torment
himself
with
impotent
passion
till
his
constitution
enfeebled
by
grief
and
illness
could
support
itself
no
longer
and
he
relapsed
into
insensibility
his
melancholy
situation
sincerely
affected
lorenzo
who
would
willingly
have
remained
in
the
apartment
of
his
friend
but
other
cares
now
demanded
his
presence
it
was
necessary
to
procure
the
order
for
seizing
the
prioress
of
st
clare
for
this
purpose
having
committed
raymond
to
the
care
of
the
best
physicians
in
madrid
he
quitted
the
hotel
de
las
cisternas
and
bent
his
course
towards
the
palace
of
the
cardinal-duke
his
disappointment
was
excessive
when
he
found
that
affairs
of
state
had
obliged
the
cardinal
to
set
out
for
a
distant
province
it
wanted
but
five
to
friday
yet
by
travelling
day
and
night
he
hoped
to
return
in
time
for
the
pilgrimage
of
st
clare
in
this
he
succeeded
he
found
the
cardinal-duke
and
represented
to
him
the
supposed
culpability
of
the
prioress
as
also
the
violent
effects
which
it
had
produced
upon
don
raymond
he
could
have
used
no
argument
so
forcible
as
this
last
of
all
his
nephews
the
marquis
was
the
only
one
to
whom
the
cardinal-duke
was
sincerely
attached
he
perfectly
doated
upon
him
and
the
prioress
could
have
committed
no
greater
crime
in
his
eyes
than
to
have
endangered
the
life
of
the
marquis
consequently
he
granted
the
order
of
arrest
without
difficulty
he
also
gave
lorenzo
a
letter
to
a
principal
officer
of
the
inquisition
desiring
him
to
see
his
mandate
executed
furnished
with
these
papers
medina
hastened
back
to
madrid
which
he
reached
on
the
friday
a
few
hours
before
dark
he
found
the
marquis
somewhat
easier
but
so
weak
and
exhausted
that
without
great
exertion
he
could
neither
speak
or
more
having
past
an
hour
by
his
bedside
lorenzo
left
him
to
communicate
his
design
to
his
uncle
as
also
to
give
don
ramirez
de
mello
the
cardinal's
letter
the
first
was
petrified
with
horror
when
he
learnt
the
fate
of
his
unhappy
niece
he
encouraged
lorenzo
to
punish
her
assassins
and
engaged
to
accompany
him
at
night
to
st
clare's
convent
don
ramirez
promised
his
firmest
support
and
selected
a
band
of
trusty
archers
to
prevent
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
populace
but
while
lorenzo
was
anxious
to
unmask
one
religious
hypocrite
he
was
unconscious
of
the
sorrows
prepared
for
him
by
another
aided
by
matilda's
infernal
agents
ambrosio
had
resolved
upon
the
innocent
antonia's
ruin
the
moment
destined
to
be
so
fatal
to
her
arrived
she
had
taken
leave
of
her
mother
for
the
night
as
she
kissed
her
she
felt
an
unusual
despondency
infuse
itself
into
her
bosom
she
left
her
and
returned
to
her
instantly
threw
herself
into
her
maternal
arms
and
bathed
her
cheek
with
tears
she
felt
uneasy
at
quitting
her
and
a
secret
presentiment
assured
her
that
never
must
they
meet
again
elvira
observed
and
tried
to
laugh
her
out
of
this
childish
prejudice
she
chid
her
mildly
for
encouraging
such
ungrounded
sadness
and
warned
her
how
dangerous
it
was
to
encourage
such
ideas
to
all
her
remonstrances
she
received
no
other
answer
than
'mother
dear
mother
oh
would
to
god
it
were
morning'
elvira
whose
inquietude
respecting
her
daughter
was
a
great
obstacle
to
her
perfect
reestablishment
was
still
labouring
under
the
effects
of
her
late
severe
illness
she
was
this
evening
more
than
usually
indisposed
and
retired
to
bed
before
her
accustomed
hour
antonia
withdrew
from
her
mother's
chamber
with
regret
and
till
the
door
closed
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
with
melancholy
expression
she
retired
to
her
own
apartment
her
heart
was
filled
with
bitterness
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
her
prospects
were
blasted
and
the
world
contained
nothing
for
which
it
was
worth
existing
she
sank
into
a
chair
reclined
her
head
upon
her
arm
and
gazed
upon
the
floor
with
a
vacant
stare
while
the
most
gloomy
images
floated
before
her
fancy
she
was
still
in
this
state
of
insensibility
when
she
was
disturbed
by
hearing
a
strain
of
soft
music
breathed
beneath
her
window
she
rose
drew
near
the
casement
and
opened
it
to
hear
it
more
distinctly
having
thrown
her
veil
over
her
face
she
ventured
to
look
out
by
the
light
of
the
moon
she
perceived
several
men
below
with
guitars
and
lutes
in
their
hands
and
at
a
little
distance
from
them
stood
another
wrapped
in
his
cloak
whose
stature
and
appearance
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
lorenzo's
she
was
not
deceived
in
this
conjecture
it
was
indeed
lorenzo
himself
who
bound
by
his
word
not
to
present
himself
to
antonia
without
his
uncle's
consent
endeavoured
by
occasional
serenades
to
convince
his
mistress
that
his
attachment
still
existed
his
stratagem
had
not
the
desired
effect
antonia
was
far
from
supposing
that
this
nightly
music
was
intended
as
a
compliment
to
her
she
was
too
modest
to
think
herself
worthy
such
attentions
and
concluding
them
to
be
addressed
to
some
neighbouring
lady
she
grieved
to
find
that
they
were
offered
by
lorenzo
the
air
which
was
played
was
plaintive
and
melodious
it
accorded
with
the
state
of
antonia's
mind
and
she
listened
with
pleasure
after
a
symphony
of
some
length
it
was
succeeded
by
the
sound
of
voices
and
antonia
distinguished
the
following
words
serenade
chorus
oh
breathe
in
gentle
strain
my
lyre
'tis
here
that
beauty
loves
to
rest
describe
the
pangs
of
fond
desire
which
rend
a
faithful
lover's
breast
song
in
every
heart
to
find
a
slave
in
every
soul
to
fix
his
reign
in
bonds
to
lead
the
wise
and
brave
and
make
the
captives
kiss
his
chain
such
is
the
power
of
love
and
oh
i
grieve
so
well
love's
power
to
know
in
sighs
to
pass
the
live-long
day
to
taste
a
short
and
broken
sleep
for
one
dear
object
far
away
all
others
scorned
to
watch
and
weep
such
are
the
pains
of
love
and
oh
i
grieve
so
well
love's
pains
to
know
to
read
consent
in
virgin
eyes
to
press
the
lip
ne'er
prest
till
then
to
hear
the
sigh
of
transport
rise
and
kiss
and
kiss
and
kiss
again
such
are
thy
pleasures
love
but
oh
when
shall
my
heart
thy
pleasures
know
chorus
now
hush
my
lyre
my
voice
be
still
sleep
gentle
maid
may
fond
desire
with
amorous
thoughts
thy
visions
fill
though
still
my
voice
and
hushed
my
lyre
the
music
ceased
the
performers
dispersed
and
silence
prevailed
through
the
street
antonia
quitted
the
window
with
regret
she
as
usual
recommended
herself
to
the
protection
of
st
rosolia
said
her
accustomed
prayers
and
retired
to
bed
sleep
was
not
long
absent
and
his
presence
relieved
her
from
her
terrors
and
inquietude
it
was
almost
two
o'clock
before
the
lustful
monk
ventured
to
bend
his
steps
towards
antonia's
dwelling
it
has
been
already
mentioned
that
the
abbey
was
at
no
great
distance
from
the
strada
di
san
iago
he
reached
the
house
unobserved
here
he
stopped
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
he
reflected
on
the
enormity
of
the
crime
the
consequences
of
a
discovery
and
the
probability
after
what
had
passed
of
elvira's
suspecting
him
to
be
her
daughter's
ravisher
on
the
other
hand
it
was
suggested
that
she
could
do
no
more
than
suspect
that
no
proofs
of
his
guilt
could
be
produced
that
it
would
seem
impossible
for
the
rape
to
have
been
committed
without
antonia's
knowing
when
where
or
by
whom
and
finally
he
believed
that
his
fame
was
too
firmly
established
to
be
shaken
by
the
unsupported
accusations
of
two
unknown
women
this
latter
argument
was
perfectly
false
he
knew
not
how
uncertain
is
the
air
of
popular
applause
and
that
a
moment
suffices
to
make
him
today
the
detestation
of
the
world
who
yesterday
was
its
idol
the
result
of
the
monk's
deliberations
was
that
he
should
proceed
in
his
enterprize
he
ascended
the
steps
leading
to
the
house
no
sooner
did
he
touch
the
door
with
the
silver
myrtle
than
it
flew
open
and
presented
him
with
a
free
passage
he
entered
and
the
door
closed
after
him
of
its
own
accord
guided
by
the
moonbeams
he
proceeded
up
the
staircase
with
slow
and
cautious
steps
he
looked
round
him
every
moment
with
apprehension
and
anxiety
he
saw
a
spy
in
every
shadow
and
heard
a
voice
in
every
murmur
of
the
night
breeze
consciousness
of
the
guilty
business
on
which
he
was
employed
appalled
his
heart
and
rendered
it
more
timid
than
a
woman's
yet
still
he
proceeded
he
reached
the
door
of
antonia's
chamber
he
stopped
and
listened
all
was
hushed
within
the
total
silence
persuaded
him
that
his
intended
victim
was
retired
to
rest
and
he
ventured
to
lift
up
the
latch
the
door
was
fastened
and
resisted
his
efforts
but
no
sooner
was
it
touched
by
the
talisman
than
the
bolt
flew
back
the
ravisher
stept
on
and
found
himself
in
the
chamber
where
slept
the
innocent
girl
unconscious
how
dangerous
a
visitor
was
drawing
near
her
couch
the
door
closed
after
him
and
the
bolt
shot
again
into
its
fastening
ambrosio
advanced
with
precaution
he
took
care
that
not
a
board
should
creak
under
his
foot
and
held
in
his
breath
as
he
approached
the
bed
his
first
attention
was
to
perform
the
magic
ceremony
as
matilda
had
charged
him
he
breathed
thrice
upon
the
silver
myrtle
pronounced
over
it
antonia's
name
and
laid
it
upon
her
pillow
the
effects
which
it
had
already
produced
permitted
not
his
doubting
its
success
in
prolonging
the
slumbers
of
his
devoted
mistress
no
sooner
was
the
enchantment
performed
than
he
considered
her
to
be
absolutely
in
his
power
and
his
eyes
flamed
with
lust
and
impatience
he
now
ventured
to
cast
a
glance
upon
the
sleeping
beauty
a
single
lamp
burning
before
the
statue
of
st
rosolia
shed
a
faint
light
through
the
room
and
permitted
him
to
examine
all
the
charms
of
the
lovely
object
before
him
the
heat
of
the
weather
had
obliged
her
to
throw
off
part
of
the
bed-cloathes
those
which
still
covered
her
ambrosio's
insolent
hand
hastened
to
remove
she
lay
with
her
cheek
reclining
upon
one
ivory
arm
the
other
rested
on
the
side
of
the
bed
with
graceful
indolence
a
few
tresses
of
her
hair
had
escaped
from
beneath
the
muslin
which
confined
the
rest
and
fell
carelessly
over
her
bosom
as
it
heaved
with
slow
and
regular
suspiration
the
warm
air
had
spread
her
cheek
with
higher
colour
than
usual
a
smile
inexpressibly
sweet
played
round
her
ripe
and
coral
lips
from
which
every
now
and
then
escaped
a
gentle
sigh
or
an
half-pronounced
sentence
an
air
of
enchanting
innocence
and
candour
pervaded
her
whole
form
and
there
was
a
sort
of
modesty
in
her
very
nakedness
which
added
fresh
stings
to
the
desires
of
the
lustful
monk
he
remained
for
some
moments
devouring
those
charms
with
his
eyes
which
soon
were
to
be
subjected
to
his
ill-regulated
passions
her
mouth
half-opened
seemed
to
solicit
a
kiss
he
bent
over
her
he
joined
his
lips
to
hers
and
drew
in
the
fragrance
of
her
breath
with
rapture
this
momentary
pleasure
increased
his
longing
for
still
greater
his
desires
were
raised
to
that
frantic
height
by
which
brutes
are
agitated
he
resolved
not
to
delay
for
one
instant
longer
the
accomplishment
of
his
wishes
and
hastily
proceeded
to
tear
off
those
garments
which
impeded
the
gratification
of
his
lust
'gracious
god'
exclaimed
a
voice
behind
him
'am
i
not
deceived
is
not
this
an
illusion'
terror
confusion
and
disappointment
accompanied
these
words
as
they
struck
ambrosio's
hearing
he
started
and
turned
towards
it
elvira
stood
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
regarded
the
monk
with
looks
of
surprize
and
detestation
a
frightful
dream
had
represented
to
her
antonia
on
the
verge
of
a
precipice
she
saw
her
trembling
on
the
brink
every
moment
seemed
to
threaten
her
fall
and
she
heard
her
exclaim
with
shrieks
'save
me
mother
save
me--yet
a
moment
and
it
will
be
too
late'
elvira
woke
in
terror
the
vision
had
made
too
strong
an
impression
upon
her
mind
to
permit
her
resting
till
assured
of
her
daughter's
safety
she
hastily
started
from
her
bed
threw
on
a
loose
night-gown
and
passing
through
the
closet
in
which
slept
the
waiting-woman
she
reached
antonia's
chamber
just
in
time
to
rescue
her
from
the
grasp
of
the
ravisher
his
shame
and
her
amazement
seemed
to
have
petrified
into
statues
both
elvira
and
the
monk
they
remained
gazing
upon
each
other
in
silence
the
lady
was
the
first
to
recover
herself
'it
is
no
dream'
she
cried
'it
is
really
ambrosio
who
stands
before
me
it
is
the
man
whom
madrid
esteems
a
saint
that
i
find
at
this
late
hour
near
the
couch
of
my
unhappy
child
monster
of
hypocrisy
i
already
suspected
your
designs
but
forbore
your
accusation
in
pity
to
human
frailty
silence
would
now
be
criminal
the
whole
city
shall
be
informed
of
your
incontinence
i
will
unmask
you
villain
and
convince
the
church
what
a
viper
she
cherishes
in
her
bosom'
pale
and
confused
the
baffled
culprit
stood
trembling
before
her
he
would
fain
have
extenuated
his
offence
but
could
find
no
apology
for
his
conduct
he
could
produce
nothing
but
broken
sentences
and
excuses
which
contradicted
each
other
elvira
was
too
justly
incensed
to
grant
the
pardon
which
he
requested
she
protested
that
she
would
raise
the
neighbourhood
and
make
him
an
example
to
all
future
hypocrites
then
hastening
to
the
bed
she
called
to
antonia
to
wake
and
finding
that
her
voice
had
no
effect
she
took
her
arm
and
raised
her
forcibly
from
the
pillow
the
charm
operated
too
powerfully
antonia
remained
insensible
and
on
being
released
by
her
mother
sank
back
upon
the
pillow
'this
slumber
cannot
be
natural'
cried
the
amazed
elvira
whose
indignation
increased
with
every
moment
'some
mystery
is
concealed
in
it
but
tremble
hypocrite
all
your
villainy
shall
soon
be
unravelled
help
help'
she
exclaimed
aloud
'within
there
flora
flora'
'hear
me
for
one
moment
lady'
cried
the
monk
restored
to
himself
by
the
urgency
of
the
danger
'by
all
that
is
sacred
and
holy
i
swear
that
your
daughter's
honour
is
still
unviolated
forgive
my
transgression
spare
me
the
shame
of
a
discovery
and
permit
me
to
regain
the
abbey
undisturbed
grant
me
this
request
in
mercy
i
promise
not
only
that
antonia
shall
be
secure
from
me
in
future
but
that
the
rest
of
my
life
shall
prove
'
elvira
interrupted
him
abruptly
'antonia
secure
from
you
i
will
secure
her
you
shall
betray
no
longer
the
confidence
of
parents
your
iniquity
shall
be
unveiled
to
the
public
eye
all
madrid
shall
shudder
at
your
perfidy
your
hypocrisy
and
incontinence
what
ho
there
flora
flora
i
say'
while
she
spoke
thus
the
remembrance
of
agnes
struck
upon
his
mind
thus
had
she
sued
to
him
for
mercy
and
thus
had
he
refused
her
prayer
it
was
now
his
turn
to
suffer
and
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
his
punishment
was
just
in
the
meanwhile
elvira
continued
to
call
flora
to
her
assistance
but
her
voice
was
so
choaked
with
passion
that
the
servant
who
was
buried
in
profound
slumber
was
insensible
to
all
her
cries
elvira
dared
not
go
towards
the
closet
in
which
flora
slept
lest
the
monk
should
take
that
opportunity
to
escape
such
indeed
was
his
intention
he
trusted
that
could
he
reach
the
abbey
unobserved
by
any
other
than
elvira
her
single
testimony
would
not
suffice
to
ruin
a
reputation
so
well
established
as
his
was
in
madrid
with
this
idea
he
gathered
up
such
garments
as
he
had
already
thrown
off
and
hastened
towards
the
door
elvira
was
aware
of
his
design
she
followed
him
and
ere
he
could
draw
back
the
bolt
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
detained
him
'attempt
not
to
fly'
said
she
'you
quit
not
this
room
without
witnesses
of
your
guilt'
ambrosio
struggled
in
vain
to
disengage
himself
elvira
quitted
not
her
hold
but
redoubled
her
cries
for
succour
the
friar's
danger
grew
more
urgent
he
expected
every
moment
to
hear
people
assembling
at
her
voice
and
worked
up
to
madness
by
the
approach
of
ruin
he
adopted
a
resolution
equally
desperate
and
savage
turning
round
suddenly
with
one
hand
he
grasped
elvira's
throat
so
as
to
prevent
her
continuing
her
clamour
and
with
the
other
dashing
her
violently
upon
the
ground
he
dragged
her
towards
the
bed
confused
by
this
unexpected
attack
she
scarcely
had
power
to
strive
at
forcing
herself
from
his
grasp
while
the
monk
snatching
the
pillow
from
beneath
her
daughter's
head
covering
with
it
elvira's
face
and
pressing
his
knee
upon
her
stomach
with
all
his
strength
endeavoured
to
put
an
end
to
her
existence
he
succeeded
but
too
well
her
natural
strength
increased
by
the
excess
of
anguish
long
did
the
sufferer
struggle
to
disengage
herself
but
in
vain
the
monk
continued
to
kneel
upon
her
breast
witnessed
without
mercy
the
convulsive
trembling
of
her
limbs
beneath
him
and
sustained
with
inhuman
firmness
the
spectacle
of
her
agonies
when
soul
and
body
were
on
the
point
of
separating
those
agonies
at
length
were
over
she
ceased
to
struggle
for
life
the
monk
took
off
the
pillow
and
gazed
upon
her
her
face
was
covered
with
a
frightful
blackness
her
limbs
moved
no
more
the
blood
was
chilled
in
her
veins
her
heart
had
forgotten
to
beat
and
her
hands
were
stiff
and
frozen
ambrosio
beheld
before
him
that
once
noble
and
majestic
form
now
become
a
corse
cold
senseless
and
disgusting
this
horrible
act
was
no
sooner
perpetrated
than
the
friar
beheld
the
enormity
of
his
crime
a
cold
dew
flowed
over
his
limbs
his
eyes
closed
he
staggered
to
a
chair
and
sank
into
it
almost
as
lifeless
as
the
unfortunate
who
lay
extended
at
his
feet
from
this
state
he
was
rouzed
by
the
necessity
of
flight
and
the
danger
of
being
found
in
antonia's
apartment
he
had
no
desire
to
profit
by
the
execution
of
his
crime
antonia
now
appeared
to
him
an
object
of
disgust
a
deadly
cold
had
usurped
the
place
of
that
warmth
which
glowed
in
his
bosom
no
ideas
offered
themselves
to
his
mind
but
those
of
death
and
guilt
of
present
shame
and
future
punishment
agitated
by
remorse
and
fear
he
prepared
for
flight
yet
his
terrors
did
not
so
compleatly
master
his
recollection
as
to
prevent
his
taking
the
precautions
necessary
for
his
safety
he
replaced
the
pillow
upon
the
bed
gathered
up
his
garments
and
with
the
fatal
talisman
in
his
hand
bent
his
unsteady
steps
towards
the
door
bewildered
by
fear
he
fancied
that
his
flight
was
opposed
by
legions
of
phantoms
whereever
he
turned
the
disfigured
corse
seemed
to
lie
in
his
passage
and
it
was
long
before
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
door
the
enchanted
myrtle
produced
its
former
effect
the
door
opened
and
he
hastened
down
the
staircase
he
entered
the
abbey
unobserved
and
having
shut
himself
into
his
cell
he
abandoned
his
soul
to
the
tortures
of
unavailing
remorse
and
terrors
of
impending
detection
tell
us
ye
dead
will
none
of
you
in
pity
to
those
you
left
behind
disclose
the
secret
o
that
some
courteous
ghost
would
blab
it
out
what
'tis
you
are
and
we
must
shortly
be
i've
heard
that
souls
departed
have
sometimes
fore-warned
men
of
their
deaths
'twas
kindly
done
to
knock
and
give
the
alarum
blair
ambrosio
shuddered
at
himself
when
he
reflected
on
his
rapid
advances
in
iniquity
the
enormous
crime
which
he
had
just
committed
filled
him
with
real
horror
the
murdered
elvira
was
continually
before
his
eyes
and
his
guilt
was
already
punished
by
the
agonies
of
his
conscience
time
however
considerably
weakened
these
impressions
one
day
passed
away
another
followed
it
and
still
not
the
least
suspicion
was
thrown
upon
him
impunity
reconciled
him
to
his
guilt
he
began
to
resume
his
spirits
and
as
his
fears
of
detection
died
away
he
paid
less
attention
to
the
reproaches
of
remorse
matilda
exerted
herself
to
quiet
his
alarms
at
the
first
intelligence
of
elvira's
death
she
seemed
greatly
affected
and
joined
the
monk
in
deploring
the
unhappy
catastrophe
of
his
adventure
but
when
she
found
his
agitation
to
be
somewhat
calmed
and
himself
better
disposed
to
listen
to
her
arguments
she
proceeded
to
mention
his
offence
in
milder
terms
and
convince
him
that
he
was
not
so
highly
culpable
as
he
appeared
to
consider
himself
she
represented
that
he
had
only
availed
himself
of
the
rights
which
nature
allows
to
every
one
those
of
self-preservation
that
either
elvira
or
himself
must
have
perished
and
that
her
inflexibility
and
resolution
to
ruin
him
had
deservedly
marked
her
out
for
the
victim
she
next
stated
that
as
he
had
before
rendered
himself
suspected
to
elvira
it
was
a
fortunate
event
for
him
that
her
lips
were
closed
by
death
since
without
this
last
adventure
her
suspicions
if
made
public
might
have
produced
very
disagreeable
consequences
he
had
therefore
freed
himself
from
an
enemy
to
whom
the
errors
of
his
conduct
were
sufficiently
known
to
make
her
dangerous
and
who
was
the
greatest
obstacle
to
his
designs
upon
antonia
those
designs
she
encouraged
him
not
to
abandon
she
assured
him
that
no
longer
protected
by
her
mother's
watchful
eye
the
daughter
would
fall
an
easy
conquest
and
by
praising
and
enumerating
antonia's
charms
she
strove
to
rekindle
the
desires
of
the
monk
in
this
endeavour
she
succeeded
but
too
well
as
if
the
crimes
into
which
his
passion
had
seduced
him
had
only
increased
its
violence
he
longed
more
eagerly
than
ever
to
enjoy
antonia
the
same
success
in
concealing
his
present
guilt
he
trusted
would
attend
his
future
he
was
deaf
to
the
murmurs
of
conscience
and
resolved
to
satisfy
his
desires
at
any
price
he
waited
only
for
an
opportunity
of
repeating
his
former
enterprize
but
to
procure
that
opportunity
by
the
same
means
was
now
impracticable
in
the
first
transports
of
despair
he
had
dashed
the
enchanted
myrtle
into
a
thousand
pieces
matilda
told
him
plainly
that
he
must
expect
no
further
assistance
from
the
infernal
powers
unless
he
was
willing
to
subscribe
to
their
established
conditions
this
ambrosio
was
determined
not
to
do
he
persuaded
himself
that
however
great
might
be
his
iniquity
so
long
as
he
preserved
his
claim
to
salvation
he
need
not
despair
of
pardon
he
therefore
resolutely
refused
to
enter
into
any
bond
or
compact
with
the
fiends
and
matilda
finding
him
obstinate
upon
this
point
forbore
to
press
him
further
she
exerted
her
invention
to
discover
some
means
of
putting
antonia
into
the
abbot's
power
nor
was
it
long
before
that
means
presented
itself
while
her
ruin
was
thus
meditating
the
unhappy
girl
herself
suffered
severely
from
the
loss
of
her
mother
every
morning
on
waking
it
was
her
first
care
to
hasten
to
elvira's
chamber
on
that
which
followed
ambrosio's
fatal
visit
she
woke
later
than
was
her
usual
custom
of
this
she
was
convinced
by
the
abbey
chimes
she
started
from
her
bed
threw
on
a
few
loose
garments
hastily
and
was
speeding
to
enquire
how
her
mother
had
passed
the
night
when
her
foot
struck
against
something
which
lay
in
her
passage
she
looked
down
what
was
her
horror
at
recognizing
elvira's
livid
corse
she
uttered
a
loud
shriek
and
threw
herself
upon
the
floor
she
clasped
the
inanimate
form
to
her
bosom
felt
that
it
was
dead-cold
and
with
a
movement
of
disgust
of
which
she
was
not
the
mistress
let
it
fall
again
from
her
arms
the
cry
had
alarmed
flora
who
hastened
to
her
assistance
the
sight
which
she
beheld
penetrated
her
with
horror
but
her
alarm
was
more
audible
than
antonia's
she
made
the
house
ring
with
her
lamentations
while
her
mistress
almost
suffocated
with
grief
could
only
mark
her
distress
by
sobs
and
groans
flora's
shrieks
soon
reached
the
ears
of
the
hostess
whose
terror
and
surprize
were
excessive
on
learning
the
cause
of
this
disturbance
a
physician
was
immediately
sent
for
but
on
the
first
moment
of
beholding
the
corse
he
declared
that
elvira's
recovery
was
beyond
the
power
of
art
he
proceeded
therefore
to
give
his
assistance
to
antonia
who
by
this
time
was
truly
in
need
of
it
she
was
conveyed
to
bed
while
the
landlady
busied
herself
in
giving
orders
for
elvira's
burial
dame
jacintha
was
a
plain
good
kind
of
woman
charitable
generous
and
devout
but
her
intellects
were
weak
and
she
was
a
miserable
slave
to
fear
and
superstition
she
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
passing
the
night
in
the
same
house
with
a
dead
body
she
was
persuaded
that
elvira's
ghost
would
appear
to
her
and
no
less
certain
that
such
a
visit
would
kill
her
with
fright
from
this
persuasion
she
resolved
to
pass
the
night
at
a
neighbour's
and
insisted
that
the
funeral
should
take
place
the
next
day
st
clare's
cemetery
being
the
nearest
it
was
determined
that
elvira
should
be
buried
there
dame
jacintha
engaged
to
defray
every
expence
attending
the
burial
she
knew
not
in
what
circumstances
antonia
was
left
but
from
the
sparing
manner
in
which
the
family
had
lived
she
concluded
them
to
be
indifferent
consequently
she
entertained
very
little
hope
of
ever
being
recompensed
but
this
consideration
prevented
her
not
from
taking
care
that
the
interment
was
performed
with
decency
and
from
showing
the
unfortunate
antonia
all
possible
respect
nobody
dies
of
mere
grief
of
this
antonia
was
an
instance
aided
by
her
youth
and
healthy
constitution
she
shook
off
the
malady
which
her
mother's
death
had
occasioned
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
remove
the
disease
of
her
mind
her
eyes
were
constantly
filled
with
tears
every
trifle
affected
her
and
she
evidently
nourished
in
her
bosom
a
profound
and
rooted
melancholy
the
slightest
mention
of
elvira
the
most
trivial
circumstance
recalling
that
beloved
parent
to
her
memory
was
sufficient
to
throw
her
into
serious
agitation
how
much
would
her
grief
have
been
increased
had
she
known
the
agonies
which
terminated
her
mother's
existence
but
of
this
no
one
entertained
the
least
suspicion
elvira
was
subject
to
strong
convulsions
it
was
supposed
that
aware
of
their
approach
she
had
dragged
herself
to
her
daughter's
chamber
in
hopes
of
assistance
that
a
sudden
access
of
her
fits
had
seized
her
too
violent
to
be
resisted
by
her
already
enfeebled
state
of
health
and
that
she
had
expired
ere
she
had
time
to
reach
the
medicine
which
generally
relieved
her
and
which
stood
upon
a
shelf
in
antonia's
room
this
idea
was
firmly
credited
by
the
few
people
who
interested
themselves
about
elvira
her
death
was
esteemed
a
natural
event
and
soon
forgotten
by
all
save
by
her
who
had
but
too
much
reason
to
deplore
her
loss
in
truth
antonia's
situation
was
sufficiently
embarrassing
and
unpleasant
she
was
alone
in
the
midst
of
a
dissipated
and
expensive
city
she
was
ill
provided
with
money
and
worse
with
friends
her
aunt
leonella
was
still
at
cordova
and
she
knew
not
her
direction
of
the
marquis
de
las
cisternas
she
heard
no
news
as
to
lorenzo
she
had
long
given
up
the
idea
of
possessing
any
interest
in
his
bosom
she
knew
not
to
whom
she
could
address
herself
in
her
present
dilemma
she
wished
to
consult
ambrosio
but
she
remembered
her
mother's
injunctions
to
shun
him
as
much
as
possible
and
the
last
conversation
which
elvira
had
held
with
her
upon
the
subject
had
given
her
sufficient
lights
respecting
his
designs
to
put
her
upon
her
guard
against
him
in
future
still
all
her
mother's
warnings
could
not
make
her
change
her
good
opinion
of
the
friar
she
continued
to
feel
that
his
friendship
and
society
were
requisite
to
her
happiness
she
looked
upon
his
failings
with
a
partial
eye
and
could
not
persuade
herself
that
he
really
had
intended
her
ruin
however
elvira
had
positively
commanded
her
to
drop
his
acquaintance
and
she
had
too
much
respect
for
her
orders
to
disobey
them
at
length
she
resolved
to
address
herself
for
advice
and
protection
to
the
marquis
de
las
cisternas
as
being
her
nearest
relation
she
wrote
to
him
briefly
stating
her
desolate
situation
she
besought
him
to
compassionate
his
brother's
child
to
continue
to
her
elvira's
pension
and
to
authorise
her
retiring
to
his
old
castle
in
murcia
which
till
now
had
been
her
retreat
having
sealed
her
letter
she
gave
it
to
the
trusty
flora
who
immediately
set
out
to
execute
her
commission
but
antonia
was
born
under
an
unlucky
star
had
she
made
her
application
to
the
marquis
but
one
day
sooner
received
as
his
niece
and
placed
at
the
head
of
his
family
she
would
have
escaped
all
the
misfortunes
with
which
she
was
now
threatened
raymond
had
always
intended
to
execute
this
plan
but
first
his
hopes
of
making
the
proposal
to
elvira
through
the
lips
of
agnes
and
afterwards
his
disappointment
at
losing
his
intended
bride
as
well
as
the
severe
illness
which
for
some
time
had
confined
him
to
his
bed
made
him
defer
from
day
to
day
the
giving
an
asylum
in
his
house
to
his
brother's
widow
he
had
commissioned
lorenzo
to
supply
her
liberally
with
money
but
elvira
unwilling
to
receive
obligations
from
that
nobleman
had
assured
him
that
she
needed
no
immediate
pecuniary
assistance
consequently
the
marquis
did
not
imagine
that
a
trifling
delay
on
his
part
could
create
any
embarrassment
and
the
distress
and
agitation
of
his
mind
might
well
excuse
his
negligence
had
he
been
informed
that
elvira's
death
had
left
her
daughter
friendless
and
unprotected
he
would
doubtless
have
taken
such
measures
as
would
have
ensured
her
from
every
danger
but
antonia
was
not
destined
to
be
so
fortunate
the
day
on
which
she
sent
her
letter
to
the
palace
de
las
cisternas
was
that
following
lorenzo's
departure
from
madrid
the
marquis
was
in
the
first
paroxysms
of
despair
at
the
conviction
that
agnes
was
indeed
no
more
he
was
delirious
and
his
life
being
in
danger
no
one
was
suffered
to
approach
him
flora
was
informed
that
he
was
incapable
of
attending
to
letters
and
that
probably
a
few
hours
would
decide
his
fate
with
this
unsatisfactory
answer
she
was
obliged
to
return
to
her
mistress
who
now
found
herself
plunged
into
greater
difficulties
than
ever
flora
and
dame
jacintha
exerted
themselves
to
console
her
the
latter
begged
her
to
make
herself
easy
for
that
as
long
as
she
chose
to
stay
with
her
she
would
treat
her
like
her
own
child
antonia
finding
that
the
good
woman
had
taken
a
real
affection
for
her
was
somewhat
comforted
by
thinking
that
she
had
at
least
one
friend
in
the
world
a
letter
was
now
brought
to
her
directed
to
elvira
she
recognized
leonella's
writing
and
opening
it
with
joy
found
a
detailed
account
of
her
aunt's
adventures
at
cordova
she
informed
her
sister
that
she
had
recovered
her
legacy
had
lost
her
heart
and
had
received
in
exchange
that
of
the
most
amiable
of
apothecaries
past
present
and
to
come
she
added
that
she
should
be
at
madrid
on
the
tuesday
night
and
meant
to
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
her
caro
sposo
in
form
though
her
nuptials
were
far
from
pleasing
antonia
leonella's
speedy
return
gave
her
niece
much
delight
she
rejoiced
in
thinking
that
she
should
once
more
be
under
a
relation's
care
she
could
not
but
judge
it
to
be
highly
improper
for
a
young
woman
to
be
living
among
absolute
strangers
with
no
one
to
regulate
her
conduct
or
protect
her
from
the
insults
to
which
in
her
defenceless
situation
she
was
exposed
she
therefore
looked
forward
with
impatience
to
the
tuesday
night
it
arrived
antonia
listened
anxiously
to
the
carriages
as
they
rolled
along
the
street
none
of
them
stopped
and
it
grew
late
without
leonella's
appearing
still
antonia
resolved
to
sit
up
till
her
aunt's
arrival
and
in
spite
of
all
her
remonstrances
dame
jacintha
and
flora
insisted
upon
doing
the
same
the
hours
passed
on
slow
and
tediously
lorenzo's
departure
from
madrid
had
put
a
stop
to
the
nightly
serenades
she
hoped
in
vain
to
hear
the
usual
sound
of
guitars
beneath
her
window
she
took
up
her
own
and
struck
a
few
chords
but
music
that
evening
had
lost
its
charms
for
her
and
she
soon
replaced
the
instrument
in
its
case
she
seated
herself
at
her
embroidery
frame
but
nothing
went
right
the
silks
were
missing
the
thread
snapped
every
moment
and
the
needles
were
so
expert
at
falling
that
they
seemed
to
be
animated
at
length
a
flake
of
wax
fell
from
the
taper
which
stood
near
her
upon
a
favourite
wreath
of
violets
this
compleatly
discomposed
her
she
threw
down
her
needle
and
quitted
the
frame
it
was
decreed
that
for
that
night
nothing
should
have
the
power
of
amusing
her
she
was
the
prey
of
ennui
and
employed
herself
in
making
fruitless
wishes
for
the
arrival
of
her
aunt
as
she
walked
with
a
listless
air
up
and
down
the
chamber
the
door
caught
her
eye
conducting
to
that
which
had
been
her
mother's
she
remembered
that
elvira's
little
library
was
arranged
there
and
thought
that
she
might
possibly
find
in
it
some
book
to
amuse
her
till
leonella
should
arrive
accordingly
she
took
her
taper
from
the
table
passed
through
the
little
closet
and
entered
the
adjoining
apartment
as
she
looked
around
her
the
sight
of
this
room
brought
to
her
recollection
a
thousand
painful
ideas
it
was
the
first
time
of
her
entering
it
since
her
mother's
death
the
total
silence
prevailing
through
the
chamber
the
bed
despoiled
of
its
furniture
the
cheerless
hearth
where
stood
an
extinguished
lamp
and
a
few
dying
plants
in
the
window
which
since
elvira's
loss
had
been
neglected
inspired
antonia
with
a
melancholy
awe
the
gloom
of
night
gave
strength
to
this
sensation
she
placed
her
light
upon
the
table
and
sank
into
a
large
chair
in
which
she
had
seen
her
mother
seated
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
times
she
was
never
to
see
her
seated
there
again
tears
unbidden
streamed
down
her
cheek
and
she
abandoned
herself
to
the
sadness
which
grew
deeper
with
every
moment
ashamed
of
her
weakness
she
at
length
rose
from
her
seat
she
proceeded
to
seek
for
what
had
brought
her
to
this
melancholy
scene
the
small
collection
of
books
was
arranged
upon
several
shelves
in
order
antonia
examined
them
without
finding
any
thing
likely
to
interest
her
till
she
put
her
hand
upon
a
volume
of
old
spanish
ballads
she
read
a
few
stanzas
of
one
of
them
they
excited
her
curiosity
she
took
down
the
book
and
seated
herself
to
peruse
it
with
more
ease
she
trimmed
the
taper
which
now
drew
towards
its
end
and
then
read
the
following
ballad
alonzo
the
brave
and
fair
imogine
a
warrior
so
bold
and
a
virgin
so
bright
conversed
as
they
sat
on
the
green
they
gazed
on
each
other
with
tender
delight
alonzo
the
brave
was
the
name
of
the
knight
the
maid's
was
the
fair
imogine
'and
oh'
said
the
youth
'since
to-morrow
i
go
to
fight
in
a
far
distant
land
your
tears
for
my
absence
soon
leaving
to
flow
some
other
will
court
you
and
you
will
bestow
on
a
wealthier
suitor
your
hand'
'oh
hush
these
suspicions'
fair
imogine
said
'offensive
to
love
and
to
me
for
if
ye
be
living
or
if
ye
be
dead
i
swear
by
the
virgin
that
none
in
your
stead
shall
husband
of
imogine
be
'if
e'er
i
by
lust
or
by
wealth
led
aside
forget
my
alonzo
the
brave
god
grant
that
to
punish
my
falsehood
and
pride
your
ghost
at
the
marriage
may
sit
by
my
side
may
tax
me
with
perjury

me
as
bride
and
bear
me
away
to
the
grave'
to
palestine
hastened
the
hero
so
bold
his
love
she
lamented
him
sore
but
scarce
had
a
twelve-month
elapsed
when
behold
a
baron
all
covered
with
jewels
and
gold
arrived
at
fair
imogine's
door
his
treasure
his
presents
his
spacious
domain
soon
made
her
untrue
to
her
vows
he
dazzled
her
eyes
he
bewildered
her
brain
he
caught
her
affections
so
light
and
so
vain
and
carried
her
home
as
his
spouse
and
now
had
the
marriage
been
blest
by
the
priest
the
revelry
now
was
begun
the
tables
they
groaned
with
the
weight
of
the
feast
nor
yet
had
the
laughter
and
merriment
ceased
when
the
bell
of
the
castle
told--'one'
then
first
with
amazement
fair
imogine
found
that
a
stranger
was
placed
by
her
side
his
air
was
terrific
he
uttered
no
sound
he
spoke
not
he
moved
not
he
looked
not
around
but
earnestly
gazed
on
the
bride
his
vizor
was
closed
and
gigantic
his
height
his
armour
was
sable
to
view
all
pleasure
and
laughter
were
hushed
at
his
sight
the
dogs
as
they
eyed
him
drew
back
in
affright
the
lights
in
the
chamber
burned
blue
his
presence
all
bosoms
appeared
to
dismay
the
guests
sat
in
silence
and
fear
at
length
spoke
the
bride
while
she
trembled
'i
pray
sir
knight
that
your
helmet
aside
you
would
lay
and
deign
to
partake
of
our
chear'
the
lady
is
silent
the
stranger
complies
his
vizor
lie
slowly
unclosed
oh
god
what
a
sight
met
fair
imogine's
eyes
what
words
can
express
her
dismay
and
surprize
when
a
skeleton's
head
was
exposed
all
present
then
uttered
a
terrified
shout
all
turned
with
disgust
from
the
scene
the
worms
they
crept
in
and
the
worms
they
crept
out
and
sported
his
eyes
and
his
temples
about
while
the
spectre
addressed
imogine
'behold
me
thou
false
one
behold
me'
he
cried
'remember
alonzo
the
brave
god
grants
that
to
punish
thy
falsehood
and
pride
my
ghost
at
thy
marriage
should
sit
by
thy
side
should
tax
thee
with
perjury
claim
thee
as
bride
and
bear
thee
away
to
the
grave'
thus
saying
his
arms
round
the
lady
he
wound
while
loudly
she
shrieked
in
dismay
then
sank
with
his
prey
through
the
wide-yawning
ground
nor
ever
again
was
fair
imogine
found
or
the
spectre
who
bore
her
away
not
long
lived
the
baron
and
none
since
that
time
to
inhabit
the
castle
presume
for
chronicles
tell
that
by
order
sublime
there
imogine
suffers
the
pain
of
her
crime
and
mourns
her
deplorable
doom
at
midnight
four
times
in
each
year
does
her
spright
when
mortals
in
slumber
are
bound
arrayed
in
her
bridal
apparel
of
white
appear
in
the
hall
with
the
skeleton-knight
and
shriek
as
he
whirls
her
around
while
they
drink
out
of
skulls
newly
torn
from
the
grave
dancing
round
them
the
spectres
are
seen
their
liquor
is
blood
and
this
horrible
stave
they
howl--'to
the
health
of
alonzo
the
brave
and
his
consort
the
false
imogine'
the
perusal
of
this
story
was
ill-calculated
to
dispel
antonia's
melancholy
she
had
naturally
a
strong
inclination
to
the
marvellous
and
her
nurse
who
believed
firmly
in
apparitions
had
related
to
her
when
an
infant
so
many
horrible
adventures
of
this
kind
that
all
elvira's
attempts
had
failed
to
eradicate
their
impressions
from
her
daughter's
mind
antonia
still
nourished
a
superstitious
prejudice
in
her
bosom
she
was
often
susceptible
of
terrors
which
when
she
discovered
their
natural
and
insignificant
cause
made
her
blush
at
her
own
weakness
with
such
a
turn
of
mind
the
adventure
which
she
had
just
been
reading
sufficed
to
give
her
apprehensions
the
alarm
the
hour
and
the
scene
combined
to
authorize
them
it
was
the
dead
of
night
she
was
alone
and
in
the
chamber
once
occupied
by
her
deceased
mother
the
weather
was
comfortless
and
stormy
the
wind
howled
around
the
house
the
doors
rattled
in
their
frames
and
the
heavy
rain
pattered
against
the
windows
no
other
sound
was
heard
the
taper
now
burnt
down
to
the
socket
sometimes
flaring
upwards
shot
a
gleam
of
light
through
the
room
then
sinking
again
seemed
upon
the
point
of
expiring
antonia's
heart
throbbed
with
agitation
her
eyes
wandered
fearfully
over
the
objects
around
her
as
the
trembling
flame
illuminated
them
at
intervals
she
attempted
to
rise
from
her
seat
but
her
limbs
trembled
so
violently
that
she
was
unable
to
proceed
she
then
called
flora
who
was
in
a
room
at
no
great
distance
but
agitation
choaked
her
voice
and
her
cries
died
away
in
hollow
murmurs
she
passed
some
minutes
in
this
situation
after
which
her
terrors
began
to
diminish
she
strove
to
recover
herself
and
acquire
strength
enough
to
quit
the
room
suddenly
she
fancied
that
she
heard
a
low
sigh
drawn
near
her
this
idea
brought
back
her
former
weakness
she
had
already
raised
herself
from
her
seat
and
was
on
the
point
of
taking
the
lamp
from
the
table
the
imaginary
noise
stopped
her
she
drew
back
her
hand
and
supported
herself
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
she
listened
anxiously
but
nothing
more
was
heard
'gracious
god'
she
said
to
herself
'what
could
be
that
sound
was
i
deceived
or
did
i
really
hear
it'
her
reflections
were
interrupted
by
a
noise
at
the
door
scarcely
audible
it
seemed
as
if
somebody
was
whispering
antonia's
alarm
increased
yet
the
bolt
she
knew
to
be
fastened
and
this
idea
in
some
degree
reassured
her
presently
the
latch
was
lifted
up
softly
and
the
door
moved
with
caution
backwards
and
forwards
excess
of
terror
now
supplied
antonia
with
that
strength
of
which
she
had
till
then
been
deprived
she
started
from
her
place
and
made
towards
the
closet
door
whence
she
might
soon
have
reached
the
chamber
where
she
expected
to
find
flora
and
dame
jacintha
scarcely
had
she
reached
the
middle
of
the
room
when
the
latch
was
lifted
up
a
second
time
an
involuntary
movement
obliged
her
to
turn
her
head
slowly
and
gradually
the
door
turned
upon
its
hinges
and
standing
upon
the
threshold
she
beheld
a
tall
thin
figure
wrapped
in
a
white
shroud
which
covered
it
from
head
to
foot
this
vision
arrested
her
feet
she
remained
as
if
petrified
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
the
stranger
with
measured
and
solemn
steps
drew
near
the
table
the
dying
taper
darted
a
blue
and
melancholy
flame
as
the
figure
advanced
towards
it
over
the
table
was
fixed
a
small
clock
the
hand
of
it
was
upon
the
stroke
of
three
the
figure
stopped
opposite
to
the
clock
it
raised
its
right
arm
and
pointed
to
the
hour
at
the
same
time
looking
earnestly
upon
antonia
who
waited
for
the
conclusion
of
this
scene
motionless
and
silent
the
figure
remained
in
this
posture
for
some
moments
the
clock
struck
when
the
sound
had
ceased
the
stranger
advanced
yet
a
few
steps
nearer
antonia
'yet
three
days'
said
a
voice
faint
hollow
and
sepulchral
'yet
three
days
and
we
meet
again'
antonia
shuddered
at
the
words
'we
meet
again'
she
pronounced
at
length
with
difficulty
'where
shall
we
meet
whom
shall
i
meet'
the
figure
pointed
to
the
ground
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
raised
the
linen
which
covered
its
face
'almighty
god
my
mother'
antonia
shrieked
and
fell
lifeless
upon
the
floor
dame
jacintha
who
was
at
work
in
a
neighbouring
chamber
was
alarmed
by
the
cry
flora
was
just
gone
down
stairs
to
fetch
fresh
oil
for
the
lamp
by
which
they
had
been
sitting
jacintha
therefore
hastened
alone
to
antonia's
assistance
and
great
was
her
amazement
to
find
her
extended
upon
the
floor
she
raised
her
in
her
arms
conveyed
her
to
her
apartment
and
placed
her
upon
the
bed
still
senseless
she
then
proceeded
to
bathe
her
temples
chafe
her
hands
and
use
all
possible
means
of
bringing
her
to
herself
with
some
difficulty
she
succeeded
antonia
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
round
her
wildly
'where
is
she'
she
cried
in
a
trembling
voice
'is
she
gone
am
i
safe
speak
to
me
comfort
me
oh
speak
to
me
for
god's
sake'
'safe
from
whom
my
child'
replied
the
astonished
jacintha
'what
alarms
you
of
whom
are
you
afraid'
'in
three
days
she
told
me
that
we
should
meet
in
three
days
i
heard
her
say
it
i
saw
her
jacintha
i
saw
her
but
this
moment'
she
threw
herself
upon
jacintha's
bosom
'you
saw
her
saw
whom'
'my
mother's
ghost'
'christ
jesus'
cried
jacintha
and
starting
from
the
bed
let
fall
antonia
upon
the
pillow
and
fled
in
consternation
out
of
the
room
as
she
hastened
down
stairs
she
met
flora
ascending
them
'go
to
your
mistress
flora'
said
she
'here
are
rare
doings
oh
i
am
the
most
unfortunate
woman
alive
my
house
is
filled
with
ghosts
and
dead
bodies
and
the
lord
knows
what
besides
yet
i
am
sure
nobody
likes
such
company
less
than
i
do
but
go
your
way
to
donna
antonia
flora
and
let
me
go
mine'
thus
saying
she
continued
her
course
to
the
street
door
which
she
opened
and
without
allowing
herself
time
to
throw
on
her
veil
she
made
the
best
of
her
way
to
the
capuchin
abbey
in
the
meanwhile
flora
hastened
to
her
lady's
chamber
equally
surprized
and
alarmed
at
jacintha's
consternation
she
found
antonia
lying
upon
the
bed
insensible
she
used
the
same
means
for
her
recovery
that
jacintha
had
already
employed
but
finding
that
her
mistress
only
recovered
from
one
fit
to
fall
into
another
she
sent
in
all
haste
for
a
physician
while
expecting
his
arrival
she
undrest
antonia
and
conveyed
her
to
bed
heedless
of
the
storm
terrified
almost
out
of
her
senses
jacintha
ran
through
the
streets
and
stopped
not
till
she
reached
the
gate
of
the
abbey
she
rang
loudly
at
the
bell
and
as
soon
as
the
porter
appeared
she
desired
permission
to
speak
to
the
superior
ambrosio
was
then
conferring
with
matilda
upon
the
means
of
procuring
access
to
antonia
the
cause
of
elvira's
death
remaining
unknown
he
was
convinced
that
crimes
were
not
so
swiftly
followed
by
punishment
as
his
instructors
the
monks
had
taught
him
and
as
till
then
he
had
himself
believed
this
persuasion
made
him
resolve
upon
antonia's
ruin
for
the
enjoyment
of
whose
person
dangers
and
difficulties
only
seemed
to
have
increased
his
passion
the
monk
had
already
made
one
attempt
to
gain
admission
to
her
presence
but
flora
had
refused
him
in
such
a
manner
as
to
convince
him
that
all
future
endeavours
must
be
vain
elvira
had
confided
her
suspicions
to
that
trusty
servant
she
had
desired
her
never
to
leave
ambrosio
alone
with
her
daughter
and
if
possible
to
prevent
their
meeting
altogether
flora
promised
to
obey
her
and
had
executed
her
orders
to
the
very
letter
ambrosio's
visit
had
been
rejected
that
morning
though
antonia
was
ignorant
of
it
he
saw
that
to
obtain
a
sight
of
his
mistress
by
open
means
was
out
of
the
question
and
both
himself
and
matilda
had
consumed
the
night
in
endeavouring
to
invent
some
plan
whose
event
might
be
more
successful
such
was
their
employment
when
a
lay-brother
entered
the
abbot's
cell
and
informed
him
that
a
woman
calling
herself
jacintha
zuniga
requested
audience
for
a
few
minutes
ambrosio
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
grant
the
petition
of
his
visitor
he
refused
it
positively
and
bad
the
lay-brother
tell
the
stranger
to
return
the
next
day
matilda
interrupted
him
'see
this
woman'
said
she
in
a
low
voice
'i
have
my
reasons'
the
abbot
obeyed
her
and
signified
that
he
would
go
to
the
parlour
immediately
with
this
answer
the
lay-brother
withdrew
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
ambrosio
enquired
why
matilda
wished
him
to
see
this
jacintha
'she
is
antonia's
hostess'
replied
matilda
'she
may
possibly
be
of
use
to
you
but
let
us
examine
her
and
learn
what
brings
her
hither'
they
proceeded
together
to
the
parlour
where
jacintha
was
already
waiting
for
the
abbot
she
had
conceived
a
great
opinion
of
his
piety
and
virtue
and
supposing
him
to
have
much
influence
over
the
devil
thought
that
it
must
be
an
easy
matter
for
him
to
lay
elvira's
ghost
in
the
red
sea
filled
with
this
persuasion
she
had
hastened
to
the
abbey
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
monk
enter
the
parlour
she
dropped
upon
her
knees
and
began
her
story
as
follows
'oh
reverend
father
such
an
accident
such
an
adventure
i
know
not
what
course
to
take
and
unless
you
can
help
me
i
shall
certainly
go
distracted
well
to
be
sure
never
was
woman
so
unfortunate
as
myself
all
in
my
power
to
keep
clear
of
such
abomination
have
i
done
and
yet
that
all
is
too
little
what
signifies
my
telling
my
beads
four
times
a
day
and
observing
every
fast
prescribed
by
the
calendar
what
signifies
my
having
made
three
pilgrimages
to
st
james
of
compostella
and
purchased
as
many
pardons
from
the
pope
as
would
buy
off
cain's
punishment
nothing
prospers
with
me
all
goes
wrong
and
god
only
knows
whether
any
thing
will
ever
go
right
again
why
now
be
your
holiness
the
judge
my
lodger
dies
in
convulsions
out
of
pure
kindness
i
bury
her
at
my
own
expence
not
that
she
is
any
relation
of
mine
or
that
i
shall
be
benefited
a
single
pistole
by
her
death
i
got
nothing
by
it
and
therefore
you
know
reverend
father
that
her
living
or
dying
was
just
the
same
to
me
but
that
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
to
return
to
what
i
was
saying
i
took
care
of
her
funeral
had
every
thing
performed
decently
and
properly
and
put
myself
to
expence
enough
god
knows
and
how
do
you
think
the
lady
repays
me
for
my
kindness
why
truly
by
refusing
to
sleep
quietly
in
her
comfortable
deal
coffin
as
a
peaceable
well-disposed
spirit
ought
to
do
and
coming
to
plague
me
who
never
wish
to
set
eyes
on
her
again
forsooth
it
well
becomes
her
to
go
racketing
about
my
house
at
midnight
popping
into
her
daughter's
room
through
the
keyhole
and
frightening
the
poor
child
out
of
her
wits
though
she
be
a
ghost
she
might
be
more
civil
than
to
bolt
into
a
person's
house
who
likes
her
company
so
little
but
as
for
me
reverend
father
the
plain
state
of
the
case
is
this
if
she
walks
into
my
house
i
must
walk
out
of
it
for
i
cannot
abide
such
visitors
not
i
thus
you
see
your
sanctity
that
without
your
assistance
i
am
ruined
and
undone
for
ever
i
shall
be
obliged
to
quit
my
house
nobody
will
take
it
when
'tis
known
that
she
haunts
it
and
then
i
shall
find
myself
in
a
fine
situation
miserable
woman
that
i
am
what
shall
i
do
what
will
become
of
me'
here
she
wept
bitterly
wrung
her
hands
and
begged
to
know
the
abbot's
opinion
of
her
case
'in
truth
good
woman'
replied
he
'it
will
be
difficult
for
me
to
relieve
you
without
knowing
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
have
forgotten
to
tell
me
what
has
happened
and
what
it
is
you
want'
'let
me
die'
cried
jacintha
'but
your
sanctity
is
in
the
right
this
then
is
the
fact
stated
briefly
a
lodger
of
mine
is
lately
dead
a
very
good
sort
of
woman
that
i
must
needs
say
for
her
as
far
as
my
knowledge
of
her
went
though
that
was
not
a
great
way
she
kept
me
too
much
at
a
distance
for
indeed
she
was
given
to
be
upon
the
high
ropes
and
whenever
i
ventured
to
speak
to
her
she
had
a
look
with
her
which
always
made
me
feel
a
little
queerish
god
forgive
me
for
saying
so
however
though
she
was
more
stately
than
needful
and
affected
to
look
down
upon
me
though
if
i
am
well
informed
i
come
of
as
good
parents
as
she
could
do
for
her
ears
for
her
father
was
a
shoe-maker
at
cordova
and
mine
was
an
hatter
at
madrid
aye
and
a
very
creditable
hatter
too
let
me
tell
you
yet
for
all
her
pride
she
was
a
quiet
well-behaved
body
and
i
never
wish
to
have
a
better
lodger
this
makes
me
wonder
the
more
at
her
not
sleeping
quietly
in
her
grave
but
there
is
no
trusting
to
people
in
this
world
for
my
part
i
never
saw
her
do
amiss
except
on
the
friday
before
her
death
to
be
sure
i
was
then
much
scandalized
by
seeing
her
eat
the
wing
of
a
chicken
how
madona
flora
quoth
i
flora
may
it
please
your
reverence
is
the
name
of
the
waiting
maid--how
madona
flora
quoth
i
does
your
mistress
eat
flesh
upon
fridays
well
well
see
the
event
and
then
remember
that
dame
jacintha
warned
you
of
it
these
were
my
very
words
but
alas
i
might
as
well
have
held
my
tongue
nobody
minded
me
and
flora
who
is
somewhat
pert
and
snappish
more
is
the
pity
say
i
told
me
that
there
was
no
more
harm
in
eating
a
chicken
than
the
egg
from
which
it
came
nay
she
even
declared
that
if
her
lady
added
a
slice
of
bacon
she
would
not
be
an
inch
nearer
damnation
god
protect
us
a
poor
ignorant
sinful
soul
i
protest
to
your
holiness
i
trembled
to
hear
her
utter
such
blasphemies
and
expected
every
moment
to
see
the
ground
open
and
swallow
her
up
chicken
and
all
for
you
must
know
worshipful
father
that
while
she
talked
thus
she
held
the
plate
in
her
hand
on
which
lay
the
identical
roast
fowl
and
a
fine
bird
it
was
that
i
must
say
for
it
done
to
a
turn
for
i
superintended
the
cooking
of
it
myself
it
was
a
little
gallician
of
my
own
raising
may
it
please
your
holiness
and
the
flesh
was
as
white
as
an
egg-shell
as
indeed
donna
elvira
told
me
herself
dame
jacintha
said
she
very
good-humouredly
though
to
say
the
truth
she
was
always
very
polite
to
me
'
here
ambrosio's
patience
failed
him
eager
to
know
jacintha's
business
in
which
antonia
seemed
to
be
concerned
he
was
almost
distracted
while
listening
to
the
rambling
of
this
prosing
old
woman
he
interrupted
her
and
protested
that
if
she
did
not
immediately
tell
her
story
and
have
done
with
it
he
should
quit
the
parlour
and
leave
her
to
get
out
of
her
difficulties
by
herself
this
threat
had
the
desired
effect
jacintha
related
her
business
in
as
few
words
as
she
could
manage
but
her
account
was
still
so
prolix
that
ambrosio
had
need
of
his
patience
to
bear
him
to
the
conclusion
'and
so
your
reverence'
said
she
after
relating
elvira's
death
and
burial
with
all
their
circumstances
'and
so
your
reverence
upon
hearing
the
shriek
i
put
away
my
work
and
away
posted
i
to
donna
antonia's
chamber
finding
nobody
there
i
past
on
to
the
next
but
i
must
own
i
was
a
little
timorous
at
going
in
for
this
was
the
very
room
where
donna
elvira
used
to
sleep
however
in
i
went
and
sure
enough
there
lay
the
young
lady
at
full
length
upon
the
floor
as
cold
as
a
stone
and
as
white
as
a
sheet
i
was
surprized
at
this
as
your
holiness
may
well
suppose
but
oh
me
how
i
shook
when
i
saw
a
great
tall
figure
at
my
elbow
whose
head
touched
the
ceiling
the
face
was
donna
elvira's
i
must
confess
but
out
of
its
mouth
came
clouds
of
fire
its
arms
were
loaded
with
heavy
chains
which
it
rattled
piteously
and
every
hair
on
its
head
was
a
serpent
as
big
as
my
arm
at
this
i
was
frightened
enough
and
began
to
say
my
ave-maria
but
the
ghost
interrupting
me
uttered
three
loud
groans
and
roared
out
in
a
terrible
voice
oh
that
chicken's
wing
my
poor
soul
suffers
for
it
as
soon
as
she
had
said
this
the
ground
opened
the
spectre
sank
down
i
heard
a
clap
of
thunder
and
the
room
was
filled
with
a
smell
of
brimstone
when
i
recovered
from
my
fright
and
had
brought
donna
antonia
to
herself
who
told
me
that
she
had
cried
out
upon
seeing
her
mother's
ghost
and
well
might
she
cry
poor
soul
had
i
been
in
her
place
i
should
have
cried
ten
times
louder
it
directly
came
into
my
head
that
if
any
one
had
power
to
quiet
this
spectre
it
must
be
your
reverence
so
hither
i
came
in
all
diligence
to
beg
that
you
will
sprinkle
my
house
with
holy
water
and
lay
the
apparition
in
the
red
sea'
ambrosio
stared
at
this
strange
story
which
he
could
not
credit
'did
donna
antonia
also
see
the
ghost'
said
he
'as
plain
as
i
see
you
reverend
father'
ambrosio
paused
for
a
moment
here
was
an
opportunity
offered
him
of
gaining
access
to
antonia
but
he
hesitated
to
employ
it
the
reputation
which
he
enjoyed
in
madrid
was
still
dear
to
him
and
since
he
had
lost
the
reality
of
virtue
it
appeared
as
if
its
semblance
was
become
more
valuable
he
was
conscious
that
publicly
to
break
through
the
rule
never
to
quit
the
abbey
precincts
would
derogate
much
from
his
supposed
austerity
in
visiting
elvira
he
had
always
taken
care
to
keep
his
features
concealed
from
the
domestics
except
by
the
lady
her
daughter
and
the
faithful
flora
he
was
known
in
the
family
by
no
other
name
than
that
of
father
jerome
should
he
comply
with
jacintha's
request
and
accompany
her
to
her
house
he
knew
that
the
violation
of
his
rule
could
not
be
kept
a
secret
however
his
eagerness
to
see
antonia
obtained
the
victory
he
even
hoped
that
the
singularity
of
this
adventure
would
justify
him
in
the
eyes
of
madrid
but
whatever
might
be
the
consequences
he
resolved
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
which
chance
had
presented
to
him
an
expressive
look
from
matilda
confirmed
him
in
this
resolution
'good
woman'
said
he
to
jacintha
'what
you
tell
me
is
so
extraordinary
that
i
can
scarcely
credit
your
assertions
however
i
will
comply
with
your
request
tomorrow
after
matins
you
may
expect
me
at
your
house
i
will
then
examine
into
what
i
can
do
for
you
and
if
it
is
in
my
power
will
free
you
from
this
unwelcome
visitor
now
then
go
home
and
peace
be
with
you'
'home'
exclaimed
jacintha
'i
go
home
not
i
by
my
troth
except
under
your
protection
i
set
no
foot
of
mine
within
the
threshold
god
help
me
the
ghost
may
meet
me
upon
the
stairs
and
whisk
me
away
with
her
to
the
devil
oh
that
i
had
accepted
young
melchior
basco's
offer
then
i
should
have
had
somebody
to
protect
me
but
now
i
am
a
lone
woman
and
meet
with
nothing
but
crosses
and
misfortunes
thank
heaven
it
is
not
yet
too
late
to
repent
there
is
simon
gonzalez
will
have
me
any
day
of
the
week
and
if
i
live
till
daybreak
i
will
marry
him
out
of
hand
an
husband
i
will
have
that
is
determined
for
now
this
ghost
is
once
in
my
house
i
shall
be
frightened
out
of
my
wits
to
sleep
alone
but
for
god's
sake
reverend
father
come
with
me
now
i
shall
have
no
rest
till
the
house
is
purified
or
the
poor
young
lady
either
the
dear
girl
she
is
in
a
piteous
taking
i
left
her
in
strong
convulsions
and
i
doubt
she
will
not
easily
recover
her
fright'
the
friar
started
and
interrupted
her
hastily
'in
convulsions
say
you
antonia
in
convulsions
lead
on
good
woman
i
follow
you
this
moment'
jacintha
insisted
upon
his
stopping
to
furnish
himself
with
the
vessel
of
holy
water
with
this
request
he
complied
thinking
herself
safe
under
his
protection
should
a
legion
of
ghosts
attack
her
the
old
woman
returned
the
monk
a
profusion
of
thanks
and
they
departed
together
for
the
strada
di
san
iago
so
strong
an
impression
had
the
spectre
made
upon
antonia
that
for
the
first
two
or
three
hours
the
physician
declared
her
life
to
be
in
danger
the
fits
at
length
becoming
less
frequent
induced
him
to
alter
his
opinion
he
said
that
to
keep
her
quiet
was
all
that
was
necessary
and
he
ordered
a
medicine
to
be
prepared
which
would
tranquillize
her
nerves
and
procure
her
that
repose
which
at
present
she
much
wanted
the
sight
of
ambrosio
who
now
appeared
with
jacintha
at
her
bedside
contributed
essentially
to
compose
her
ruffled
spirits
elvira
had
not
sufficiently
explained
herself
upon
the
nature
of
his
designs
to
make
a
girl
so
ignorant
of
the
world
as
her
daughter
aware
how
dangerous
was
his
acquaintance
at
this
moment
when
penetrated
with
horror
at
the
scene
which
had
just
past
and
dreading
to
contemplate
the
ghost's
prediction
her
mind
had
need
of
all
the
succours
of
friendship
and
religion
antonia
regarded
the
abbot
with
an
eye
doubly
partial
that
strong
prepossession
in
his
favour
still
existed
which
she
had
felt
for
him
at
first
sight
she
fancied
yet
knew
not
wherefore
that
his
presence
was
a
safeguard
to
her
from
every
danger
insult
or
misfortune
she
thanked
him
gratefully
for
his
visit
and
related
to
him
the
adventure
which
had
alarmed
her
so
seriously
the
abbot
strove
to
reassure
her
and
convince
her
that
the
whole
had
been
a
deception
of
her
overheated
fancy
the
solitude
in
which
she
had
passed
the
evening
the
gloom
of
night
the
book
which
she
had
been
reading
and
the
room
in
which
she
sat
were
all
calculated
to
place
before
her
such
a
vision
he
treated
the
idea
of
ghosts
with
ridicule
and
produced
strong
arguments
to
prove
the
fallacy
of
such
a
system
his
conversation
tranquillized
and
comforted
her
but
did
not
convince
her
she
could
not
believe
that
the
spectre
had
been
a
mere
creature
of
her
imagination
every
circumstance
was
impressed
upon
her
mind
too
forcibly
to
permit
her
flattering
herself
with
such
an
idea
she
persisted
in
asserting
that
she
had
really
seen
her
mother's
ghost
had
heard
the
period
of
her
dissolution
announced
and
declared
that
she
never
should
quit
her
bed
alive
ambrosio
advised
her
against
encouraging
these
sentiments
and
then
quitted
her
chamber
having
promised
to
repeat
his
visit
on
the
morrow
antonia
received
this
assurance
with
every
mark
of
joy
but
the
monk
easily
perceived
that
he
was
not
equally
acceptable
to
her
attendant
flora
obeyed
elvira's
injunctions
with
the
most
scrupulous
observance
she
examined
every
circumstance
with
an
anxious
eye
likely
in
the
least
to
prejudice
her
young
mistress
to
whom
she
had
been
attached
for
many
years
she
was
a
native
of
cuba
had
followed
elvira
to
spain
and
loved
the
young
antonia
with
a
mother's
affection
flora
quitted
not
the
room
for
a
moment
while
the
abbot
remained
there
she
watched
his
every
word
his
every
look
his
every
action
he
saw
that
her
suspicious
eye
was
always
fixed
upon
him
and
conscious
that
his
designs
would
not
bear
inspection
so
minute
he
felt
frequently
confused
and
disconcerted
he
was
aware
that
she
doubted
the
purity
of
his
intentions
that
she
would
never
leave
him
alone
with
antonia
and
his
mistress
defended
by
the
presence
of
this
vigilant
observer
he
despaired
of
finding
the
means
to
gratify
his
passion
as
he
quitted
the
house
jacintha
met
him
and
begged
that
some
masses
might
be
sung
for
the
repose
of
elvira's
soul
which
she
doubted
not
was
suffering
in
purgatory
he
promised
not
to
forget
her
request
but
he
perfectly
gained
the
old
woman's
heart
by
engaging
to
watch
during
the
whole
of
the
approaching
night
in
the
haunted
chamber
jacintha
could
find
no
terms
sufficiently
strong
to
express
her
gratitude
and
the
monk
departed
loaded
with
her
benedictions
it
was
broad
day
when
he
returned
to
the
abbey
his
first
care
was
to
communicate
what
had
past
to
his
confident
he
felt
too
sincere
a
passion
for
antonia
to
have
heard
unmoved
the
prediction
of
her
speedy
death
and
he
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
losing
an
object
so
dear
to
him
upon
this
head
matilda
reassured
him
she
confirmed
the
arguments
which
himself
had
already
used
she
declared
antonia
to
have
been
deceived
by
the
wandering
of
her
brain
by
the
spleen
which
opprest
her
at
the
moment
and
by
the
natural
turn
of
her
mind
to
superstition
and
the
marvellous
as
to
jacintha's
account
the
absurdity
refuted
itself
the
abbot
hesitated
not
to
believe
that
she
had
fabricated
the
whole
story
either
confused
by
terror
or
hoping
to
make
him
comply
more
readily
with
her
request
having
overruled
the
monk's
apprehensions
matilda
continued
thus
'the
prediction
and
the
ghost
are
equally
false
but
it
must
be
your
care
ambrosio
to
verify
the
first
antonia
within
three
days
must
indeed
be
dead
to
the
world
but
she
must
live
for
you
her
present
illness
and
this
fancy
which
she
has
taken
into
her
head
will
colour
a
plan
which
i
have
long
meditated
but
which
was
impracticable
without
your
procuring
access
to
antonia
she
shall
be
yours
not
for
a
single
night
but
for
ever
all
the
vigilance
of
her
duenna
shall
not
avail
her
you
shall
riot
unrestrained
in
the
charms
of
your
mistress
this
very
day
must
the
scheme
be
put
in
execution
for
you
have
no
time
to
lose
the
nephew
of
the
duke
of
medina
celi
prepares
to
demand
antonia
for
his
bride
in
a
few
days
she
will
be
removed
to
the
palace
of
her
relation
the
marquis
de
las
cisternas
and
there
she
will
be
secure
from
your
attempts
thus
during
your
absence
have
i
been
informed
by
my
spies
who
are
ever
employed
in
bringing
me
intelligence
for
your
service
now
then
listen
to
me
there
is
a
juice
extracted
from
certain
herbs
known
but
to
few
which
brings
on
the
person
who
drinks
it
the
exact
image
of
death
let
this
be
administered
to
antonia
you
may
easily
find
means
to
pour
a
few
drops
into
her
medicine
the
effect
will
be
throwing
her
into
strong
convulsions
for
an
hour
after
which
her
blood
will
gradually
cease
to
flow
and
heart
to
beat
a
mortal
paleness
will
spread
itself
over
her
features
and
she
will
appear
a
corse
to
every
eye
she
has
no
friends
about
her
you
may
charge
yourself
unsuspected
with
the
superintendence
of
her
funeral
and
cause
her
to
be
buried
in
the
vaults
of
st
clare
their
solitude
and
easy
access
render
these
caverns
favourable
to
your
designs
give
antonia
the
soporific
draught
this
evening
eight
and
forty
hours
after
she
has
drank
it
life
will
revive
to
her
bosom
she
will
then
be
absolutely
in
your
power
she
will
find
all
resistance
unavailing
and
necessity
will
compel
her
to
receive
you
in
her
arms'
'antonia
will
be
in
my
power'
exclaimed
the
monk
'matilda
you
transport
me
at
length
then
happiness
will
be
mine
and
that
happiness
will
be
matilda's
gift
will
be
the
gift
of
friendship
i
shall
clasp
antonia
in
my
arms
far
from
every
prying
eye
from
every
tormenting
intruder
i
shall
sigh
out
my
soul
upon
her
bosom
shall
teach
her
young
heart
the
first
rudiments
of
pleasure
and
revel
uncontrouled
in
the
endless
variety
of
her
charms
and
shall
this
delight
indeed
by
mine
shall
i
give
the
reins

tumultuous

oh
matilda
how
can
i
express
to
you
my
gratitude'
'by
profiting
by
my
counsels
ambrosio
i
live
but
to
serve
you
your
interest
and
happiness
are
equally
mine
be
your

antonia's
but
to
your

and
your

i
still
assert

claim

now
my

pleasure

my

procure
the
gratification
of
your
wishes
i
shall
consider
my
trouble
to
be
amply
repaid
but
let
us
lose
no
time
the
liquor
of
which
i
spoke
is
only
to
be
found
in
st
clare's
laboratory
hasten
then
to
the
prioress
request
of
her
admission
to
the
laboratory
and
it
will
not
be
denied
there
is
a
closet
at
the
lower
end
of
the
great
room
filled
with
liquids
of
different
colours
and
qualities
the
bottle
in
question
stands
by
itself
upon
the
third
shelf
on
the
left
it
contains
a
greenish
liquor
fill
a
small
phial
with
it
when
you
are
unobserved
and
antonia
is
your
own'
the
monk
hesitated
not
to
adopt
this
infamous
plan
his
desires
but
too
violent
before
had
acquired
fresh
vigour
from
the
sight
of
antonia
as
he
sat
by
her
bedside
accident
had
discovered
to
him
some
of
those
charms
which
till
then
had
been
concealed
from
him
he
found
them
even
more
perfect
than
his
ardent
imagination
had
pictured
them
sometimes
her
white
and
polished
arm
was
displayed
in
arranging
the
pillow
sometimes
a
sudden
movement
discovered
part
of
her
swelling
bosom
but
whereever
the
new-found
charm
presented
itself
there
rested
the
friar's
gloting
eyes
scarcely
could
he
master
himself
sufficiently
to
conceal
his
desires
from
antonia
and
her
vigilant
duenna
inflamed
by
the
remembrance
of
these
beauties
he
entered
into
matilda's
scheme
without
hesitation
no
sooner
were
matins
over
than
he
bent
his
course
towards
the
convent
of
st
clare
his
arrival
threw
the
whole
sisterhood
into
the
utmost
amazement
the
prioress
was
sensible
of
the
honour
done
her
convent
by
his
paying
it
his
first
visit
and
strove
to
express
her
gratitude
by
every
possible
attention
he
was
paraded
through
the
garden
shown
all
the
reliques
of
saints
and
martyrs
and
treated
with
as
much
respect
and
distinction
as
had
he
been
the
pope
himself
on
his
part
ambrosio
received
the
domina's
civilities
very
graciously
and
strove
to
remove
her
surprize
at
his
having
broken
through
his
resolution
he
stated
that
among
his
penitents
illness
prevented
many
from
quitting
their
houses
these
were
exactly
the
people
who
most
needed
his
advice
and
the
comforts
of
religion
many
representations
had
been
made
to
him
upon
this
account
and
though
highly
repugnant
to
his
own
wishes
he
had
found
it
absolutely
necessary
for
the
service
of
heaven
to
change
his
determination
and
quit
his
beloved
retirement
the
prioress
applauded
his
zeal
in
his
profession
and
his
charity
towards
mankind
she
declared
that
madrid
was
happy
in
possessing
a
man
so
perfect
and
irreproachable
in
such
discourse
the
friar
at
length
reached
the
laboratory
he
found
the
closet
the
bottle
stood
in
the
place
which
matilda
had
described
and
the
monk
seized
an
opportunity
to
fill
his
phial
unobserved
with
the
soporific
liquor
then
having
partaken
of
a
collation
in
the
refectory
he
retired
from
the
convent
pleased
with
the
success
of
his
visit
and
leaving
the
nuns
delighted
by
the
honour
conferred
upon
them
he
waited
till
evening
before
he
took
the
road
to
antonia's
dwelling
jacintha
welcomed
him
with
transport
and
besought
him
not
to
forget
his
promise
to
pass
the
night
in
the
haunted
chamber
that
promise
he
now
repeated
he
found
antonia
tolerably
well
but
still
harping
upon
the
ghost's
prediction
flora
moved
not
from
her
lady's
bed
and
by
symptoms
yet
stronger
than
on
the
former
night
testified
her
dislike
to
the
abbot's
presence
still
ambrosio
affected
not
to
observe
them
the
physician
arrived
while
he
was
conversing
with
antonia
it
was
dark
already
lights
were
called
for
and
flora
was
compelled
to
descend
for
them
herself
however
as
she
left
a
third
person
in
the
room
and
expected
to
be
absent
but
a
few
minutes
she
believed
that
she
risqued
nothing
in
quitting
her
post
no
sooner
had
she
left
the
room
than
ambrosio
moved
towards
the
table
on
which
stood
antonia's
medicine
it
was
placed
in
a
recess
of
the
window
the
physician
seated
in
an
armed-chair
and
employed
in
questioning
his
patient
paid
no
attention
to
the
proceedings
of
the
monk
ambrosio
seized
the
opportunity
he
drew
out
the
fatal
phial
and
let
a
few
drops
fall
into
the
medicine
he
then
hastily
left
the
table
and
returned
to
the
seat
which
he
had
quitted
when
flora
made
her
appearance
with
lights
every
thing
seemed
to
be
exactly
as
she
had
left
it
the
physician
declared
that
antonia
might
quit
her
chamber
the
next
day
with
perfect
safety
he
recommended
her
following
the
same
prescription
which
on
the
night
before
had
procured
her
a
refreshing
sleep
flora
replied
that
the
draught
stood
ready
upon
the
table
he
advised
the
patient
to
take
it
without
delay
and
then
retired
flora
poured
the
medicine
into
a
cup
and
presented
it
to
her
mistress
at
that
moment
ambrosio's
courage
failed
him
might
not
matilda
have
deceived
him
might
not
jealousy
have
persuaded
her
to
destroy
her
rival
and
substitute
poison
in
the
room
of
an
opiate
this
idea
appeared
so
reasonable
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
preventing
her
from
swallowing
the
medicine
his
resolution
was
adopted
too
late
the
cup
was
already
emptied
and
antonia
restored
it
into
flora's
hands
no
remedy
was
now
to
be
found
ambrosio
could
only
expect
the
moment
impatiently
destined
to
decide
upon
antonia's
life
or
death
upon
his
own
happiness
or
despair
dreading
to
create
suspicion
by
his
stay
or
betray
himself
by
his
mind's
agitation
he
took
leave
of
his
victim
and
withdrew
from
the
room
antonia
parted
from
him
with
less
cordiality
than
on
the
former
night
flora
had
represented
to
her
mistress
that
to
admit
his
visits
was
to
disobey
her
mother's
orders
she
described
to
her
his
emotion
on
entering
the
room
and
the
fire
which
sparkled
in
his
eyes
while
he
gazed
upon
her
this
had
escaped
antonia's
observation
but
not
her
attendant's
who
explaining
the
monk's
designs
and
their
probable
consequences
in
terms
much
clearer
than
elvira's
though
not
quite
so
delicate
had
succeeded
in
alarming
her
young
lady
and
persuading
her
to
treat
him
more
distantly
than
she
had
done
hitherto
the
idea
of
obeying
her
mother's
will
at
once
determined
antonia
though
she
grieved
at
losing
his
society
she
conquered
herself
sufficiently
to
receive
the
monk
with
some
degree
of
reserve
and
coldness
she
thanked
him
with
respect
and
gratitude
for
his
former
visits
but
did
not
invite
his
repeating
them
in
future
it
now
was
not
the
friar's
interest
to
solicit
admission
to
her
presence
and
he
took
leave
of
her
as
if
not
designing
to
return
fully
persuaded
that
the
acquaintance
which
she
dreaded
was
now
at
an
end
flora
was
so
much
worked
upon
by
his
easy
compliance
that
she
began
to
doubt
the
justice
of
her
suspicions
as
she
lighted
him
down
stairs
she
thanked
him
for
having
endeavoured
to
root
out
from
antonia's
mind
her
superstitious
terrors
of
the
spectre's
prediction
she
added
that
as
he
seemed
interested
in
donna
antonia's
welfare
should
any
change
take
place
in
her
situation
she
would
be
careful
to
let
him
know
it
the
monk
in
replying
took
pains
to
raise
his
voice
hoping
that
jacintha
would
hear
it
in
this
he
succeeded
as
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
with
his
conductress
the
landlady
failed
not
to
make
her
appearance
'why
surely
you
are
not
going
away
reverend
father'
cried
she
'did
you
not
promise
to
pass
the
night
in
the
haunted
chamber
christ
jesus
i
shall
be
left
alone
with
the
ghost
and
a
fine
pickle
i
shall
be
in
by
morning
do
all
i
could
say
all
i
could
that
obstinate
old
brute
simon
gonzalez
refused
to
marry
me
today
and
before
tomorrow
comes
i
suppose
i
shall
be
torn
to
pieces
by
the
ghosts
and
goblins
and
devils
and
what
not
for
god's
sake
your
holiness
do
not
leave
me
in
such
a
woeful
condition
on
my
bended
knees
i
beseech
you
to
keep
your
promise
watch
this
night
in
the
haunted
chamber
lay
the
apparition
in
the
red
sea
and
jacintha
remembers
you
in
her
prayers
to
the
last
day
of
her
existence'
this
request
ambrosio
expected
and
desired
yet
he
affected
to
raise
objections
and
to
seem
unwilling
to
keep
his
word
he
told
jacintha
that
the
ghost
existed
nowhere
but
in
her
own
brain
and
that
her
insisting
upon
his
staying
all
night
in
the
house
was
ridiculous
and
useless
jacintha
was
obstinate
she
was
not
to
be
convinced
and
pressed
him
so
urgently
not
to
leave
her
a
prey
to
the
devil
that
at
length
he
granted
her
request
all
this
show
of
resistance
imposed
not
upon
flora
who
was
naturally
of
a
suspicious
temper
she
suspected
the
monk
to
be
acting
a
part
very
contrary
to
his
own
inclinations
and
that
he
wished
for
no
better
than
to
remain
where
he
was
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
believe
that
jacintha
was
in
his
interest
and
the
poor
old
woman
was
immediately
set
down
as
no
better
than
a
procuress
while
she
applauded
herself
for
having
penetrated
into
this
plot
against
her
lady's
honour
she
resolved
in
secret
to
render
it
fruitless
'so
then'
said
she
to
the
abbot
with
a
look
half-satirical
and
half
indignant
'so
then
you
mean
to
stay
here
tonight
do
so
in
god's
name
nobody
will
prevent
you
sit
up
to
watch
for
the
ghost's
arrival
i
shall
sit
up
too
and
the
lord
grant
that
i
may
see
nothing
worse
than
a
ghost
i
quit
not
donna
antonia's
bedside
during
this
blessed
night
let
me
see
any
one
dare
to
enter
the
room
and
be
he
mortal
or
immortal
be
he
ghost
devil
or
man
i
warrant
his
repenting
that
ever
he
crossed
the
threshold'
this
hint
was
sufficiently
strong
and
ambrosio
understood
its
meaning
but
instead
of
showing
that
he
perceived
her
suspicions
he
replied
mildly
that
he
approved
the
duenna's
precautions
and
advised
her
to
persevere
in
her
intention
this
she
assured
him
faithfully
that
he
might
depend
upon
her
doing
jacintha
then
conducted
him
into
the
chamber
where
the
ghost
had
appeared
and
flora
returned
to
her
lady's
jacintha
opened
the
door
of
the
haunted
room
with
a
trembling
hand
she
ventured
to
peep
in
but
the
wealth
of
india
would
not
have
tempted
her
to
cross
the
threshold
she
gave
the
taper
to
the
monk
wished
him
well
through
the
adventure
and
hastened
to
be
gone
ambrosio
entered
he
bolted
the
door
placed
the
light
upon
the
table
and
seated
himself
in
the
chair
which
on
the
former
night
had
sustained
antonia
in
spite
of
matilda's
assurances
that
the
spectre
was
a
mere
creation
of
fancy
his
mind
was
impressed
with
a
certain
mysterious
horror
he
in
vain
endeavoured
to
shake
it
off
the
silence
of
the
night
the
story
of
the
apparition
the
chamber
wainscotted
with
dark
oak
pannells
the
recollection
which
it
brought
with
it
of
the
murdered
elvira
and
his
incertitude
respecting
the
nature
of
the
drops
given
by
him
to
antonia
made
him
feel
uneasy
at
his
present
situation
but
he
thought
much
less
of
the
spectre
than
of
the
poison
should
he
have
destroyed
the
only
object
which
rendered
life
dear
to
him
should
the
ghost's
prediction
prove
true
should
antonia
in
three
days
be
no
more
and
he
the
wretched
cause
of
her
death

the
supposition
was
too
horrible
to
dwell
upon
he
drove
away
these
dreadful
images
and
as
often
they
presented
themselves
again
before
him
matilda
had
assured
him
that
the
effects
of
the
opiate
would
be
speedy
he
listened
with
fear
yet
with
eagerness
expecting
to
hear
some
disturbance
in
the
adjoining
chamber
all
was
still
silent
he
concluded
that
the
drops
had
not
begun
to
operate
great
was
the
stake
for
which
he
now
played
a
moment
would
suffice
to
decide
upon
his
misery
or
happiness
matilda
had
taught
him
the
means
of
ascertaining
that
life
was
not
extinct
for
ever
upon
this
assay
depended
all
his
hopes
with
every
instant
his
impatience
redoubled
his
terrors
grew
more
lively
his
anxiety
more
awake
unable
to
bear
this
state
of
incertitude
he
endeavoured
to
divert
it
by
substituting
the
thoughts
of
others
to
his
own
the
books
as
was
before
mentioned
were
ranged
upon
shelves
near
the
table
this
stood
exactly
opposite
to
the
bed
which
was
placed
in
an
alcove
near
the
closet
door
ambrosio
took
down
a
volume
and
seated
himself
by
the
table
but
his
attention
wandered
from
the
pages
before
him
antonia's
image
and
that
of
the
murdered
elvira
persisted
to
force
themselves
before
his
imagination
still
he
continued
to
read
though
his
eyes
ran
over
the
characters
without
his
mind
being
conscious
of
their
import
such
was
his
occupation
when
he
fancied
that
he
heard
a
footstep
he
turned
his
head
but
nobody
was
to
be
seen
he
resumed
his
book
but
in
a
few
minutes
after
the
same
sound
was
repeated
and
followed
by
a
rustling
noise
close
behind
him
he
now
started
from
his
seat
and
looking
round
him
perceived
the
closet
door
standing
half-unclosed
on
his
first
entering
the
room
he
had
tried
to
open
it
but
found
it
bolted
on
the
inside
'how
is
this'
said
he
to
himself
'how
comes
this
door
unfastened'
he
advanced
towards
it
he
pushed
it
open
and
looked
into
the
closet
no
one
was
there
while
he
stood
irresolute
he
thought
that
he
distinguished
a
groaning
in
the
adjacent
chamber
it
was
antonia's
and
he
supposed
that
the
drops
began
to
take
effect
but
upon
listening
more
attentively
he
found
the
noise
to
be
caused
by
jacintha
who
had
fallen
asleep
by
the
lady's
bedside
and
was
snoring
most
lustily
ambrosio
drew
back
and
returned
to
the
other
room
musing
upon
the
sudden
opening
of
the
closet
door
for
which
he
strove
in
vain
to
account
he
paced
the
chamber
up
and
down
in
silence
at
length
he
stopped
and
the
bed
attracted
his
attention
the
curtain
of
the
recess
was
but
half-drawn
he
sighed
involuntarily
'that
bed'
said
he
in
a
low
voice
'that
bed
was
elvira's
there
has
she
past
many
a
quiet
night
for
she
was
good
and
innocent
how
sound
must
have
been
her
sleep
and
yet
now
she
sleeps
sounder
does
she
indeed
sleep
oh
god
grant
that
she
may
what
if
she
rose
from
her
grave
at
this
sad
and
silent
hour
what
if
she
broke
the
bonds
of
the
tomb
and
glided
angrily
before
my
blasted
eyes
oh
i
never
could
support
the
sight
again
to
see
her
form
distorted
by
dying
agonies
her
blood-swollen
veins
her
livid
countenance
her
eyes
bursting
from
their
sockets
with
pain
to
hear
her
speak
of
future
punishment
menace
me
with
heaven's
vengeance
tax
me
with
the
crimes
i
have
committed
with
those
i
am
going
to
commit

great
god
what
is
that'
as
he
uttered
these
words
his
eyes
which
were
fixed
upon
the
bed
saw
the
curtain
shaken
gently
backwards
and
forwards
the
apparition
was
recalled
to
his
mind
and
he
almost
fancied
that
he
beheld
elvira's
visionary
form
reclining
upon
the
bed
a
few
moments
consideration
sufficed
to
reassure
him
'it
was
only
the
wind'
said
he
recovering
himself
again
he
paced
the
chamber
but
an
involuntary
movement
of
awe
and
inquietude
constantly
led
his
eye
towards
the
alcove
he
drew
near
it
with
irresolution
he
paused
before
he
ascended
the
few
steps
which
led
to
it
he
put
out
his
hand
thrice
to
remove
the
curtain
and
as
often
drew
it
back
'absurd
terrors'
he
cried
at
length
ashamed
of
his
own
weakness----
hastily
he
mounted
the
steps
when
a
figure
drest
in
white
started
from
the
alcove
and
gliding
by
him
made
with
precipitation
towards
the
closet
madness
and
despair
now
supplied
the
monk
with
that
courage
of
which
he
had
till
then
been
destitute
he
flew
down
the
steps
pursued
the
apparition
and
attempted
to
grasp
it
'ghost
or
devil
i
hold
you'
he
exclaimed
and
seized
the
spectre
by
the
arm
'oh
christ
jesus'
cried
a
shrill
voice
'holy
father
how
you
gripe
me
i
protest
that
i
meant
no
harm'
this
address
as
well
as
the
arm
which
he
held
convinced
the
abbot
that
the
supposed
ghost
was
substantial
flesh
and
blood
he
drew
the
intruder
towards
the
table
and
holding
up
the
light
discovered
the
features
of

madona
flora
incensed
at
having
been
betrayed
by
this
trifling
cause
into
fears
so
ridiculous
he
asked
her
sternly
what
business
had
brought
her
to
that
chamber
flora
ashamed
at
being
found
out
and
terrified
at
the
severity
of
ambrosio's
looks
fell
upon
her
knees
and
promised
to
make
a
full
confession
'i
protest
reverend
father'
said
she
'that
i
am
quite
grieved
at
having
disturbed
you
nothing
was
further
from
my
intention
i
meant
to
get
out
of
the
room
as
quietly
as
i
got
in
and
had
you
been
ignorant
that
i
watched
you
you
know
it
would
have
been
the
same
thing
as
if
i
had
not
watched
you
at
all
to
be
sure
i
did
very
wrong
in
being
a
spy
upon
you
that
i
cannot
deny
but
lord
your
reverence
how
can
a
poor
weak
woman
resist
curiosity
mine
was
so
strong
to
know
what
you
were
doing
that
i
could
not
but
try
to
get
a
little
peep
without
any
body
knowing
any
thing
about
it
so
with
that
i
left
old
dame
jacintha
sitting
by
my
lady's
bed
and
i
ventured
to
steal
into
the
closet
being
unwilling
to
interrupt
you
i
contented
myself
at
first
with
putting
my
eye
to
the
keyhole
but
as
i
could
see
nothing
by
this
means
i
undrew
the
bolt
and
while
your
back
was
turned
to
the
alcove
i
whipt
me
in
softly
and
silently
here
i
lay
snug
behind
the
curtain
till
your
reverence
found
me
out
and
seized
me
ere
i
had
time
to
regain
the
closet
door
this
is
the
whole
truth
i
assure
you
holy
father
and
i
beg
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
for
my
impertinence'
during
this
speech
the
abbot
had
time
to
recollect
himself
he
was
satisfied
with
reading
the
penitent
spy
a
lecture
upon
the
dangers
of
curiosity
and
the
meanness
of
the
action
in
which
she
had
been
just
discovered
flora
declared
herself
fully
persuaded
that
she
had
done
wrong
she
promised
never
to
be
guilty
of
the
same
fault
again
and
was
retiring
very
humble
and
contrite
to
antonia's
chamber
when
the
closet
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
and
in
rushed
jacintha
pale
and
out
of
breath
'oh
father
father'
she
cried
in
a
voice
almost
choaked
with
terror
'what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
here
is
a
fine
piece
of
work
nothing
but
misfortunes
nothing
but
dead
people
and
dying
people
oh
i
shall
go
distracted
i
shall
go
distracted'
'speak
speak'
cried
flora
and
the
monk
at
the
same
time
'what
has
happened
what
is
the
matter'
'oh
i
shall
have
another
corse
in
my
house
some
witch
has
certainly
cast
a
spell
upon
it
upon
me
and
upon
all
about
me
poor
donna
antonia
there
she
lies
in
just
such
convulsions
as
killed
her
mother
the
ghost
told
her
true
i
am
sure
the
ghost
has
told
her
true'
flora
ran
or
rather
flew
to
her
lady's
chamber
ambrosio
followed
her
his
bosom
trembling
with
hope
and
apprehension
they
found
antonia
as
jacintha
had
described
torn
by
racking
convulsions
from
which
they
in
vain
endeavoured
to
relieve
her
the
monk
dispatched
jacintha
to
the
abbey
in
all
haste
and
commissioned
her
to
bring
father
pablos
back
with
her
without
losing
a
moment
'i
will
go
for
him'
replied
jacintha
'and
tell
him
to
come
hither
but
as
to
bringing
him
myself
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
i
am
sure
that
the
house
is
bewitched
and
burn
me
if
ever
i
set
foot
in
it
again'
with
this
resolution
she
set
out
for
the
monastery
and
delivered
to
father
pablos
the
abbot's
orders
she
then
betook
herself
to
the
house
of
old
simon
gonzalez
whom
she
resolved
never
to
quit
till
she
had
made
him
her
husband
and
his
dwelling
her
own
father
pablos
had
no
sooner
beheld
antonia
than
he
pronounced
her
incurable
the
convulsions
continued
for
an
hour
during
that
time
her
agonies
were
much
milder
than
those
which
her
groans
created
in
the
abbot's
heart
her
every
pang
seemed
a
dagger
in
his
bosom
and
he
cursed
himself
a
thousand
times
for
having
adopted
so
barbarous
a
project
the
hour
being
expired
by
degrees
the
fits
became
less
frequent
and
antonia
less
agitated
she
felt
that
her
dissolution
was
approaching
and
that
nothing
could
save
her
'worthy
ambrosio'
she
said
in
a
feeble
voice
while
she
pressed
his
hand
to
her
lips
'i
am
now
at
liberty
to
express
how
grateful
is
my
heart
for
your
attention
and
kindness
i
am
upon
the
bed
of
death
yet
an
hour
and
i
shall
be
no
more
i
may
therefore
acknowledge
without
restraint
that
to
relinquish
your
society
was
very
painful
to
me
but
such
was
the
will
of
a
parent
and
i
dared
not
disobey
i
die
without
repugnance
there
are
few
who
will
lament
my
leaving
them
there
are
few
whom
i
lament
to
leave
among
those
few
i
lament
for
none
more
than
for
yourself
but
we
shall
meet
again
ambrosio
we
shall
one
day
meet
in
heaven
there
shall
our
friendship
be
renewed
and
my
mother
shall
view
it
with
pleasure'
she
paused
the
abbot
shuddered
when
she
mentioned
elvira
antonia
imputed
his
emotion
to
pity
and
concern
for
her
'you
are
grieved
for
me
father'
she
continued
'ah
sigh
not
for
my
loss
i
have
no
crimes
to
repent
at
least
none
of
which
i
am
conscious
and
i
restore
my
soul
without
fear
to
him
from
whom
i
received
it
i
have
but
few
requests
to
make
yet
let
me
hope
that
what
few
i
have
shall
be
granted
let
a
solemn
mass
be
said
for
my
soul's
repose
and
another
for
that
of
my
beloved
mother
not
that
i
doubt
her
resting
in
her
grave
i
am
now
convinced
that
my
reason
wandered
and
the
falsehood
of
the
ghost's
prediction
is
sufficient
to
prove
my
error
but
every
one
has
some
failing
my
mother
may
have
had
hers
though
i
knew
them
not
i
therefore
wish
a
mass
to
be
celebrated
for
her
repose
and
the
expence
may
be
defrayed
by
the
little
wealth
of
which
i
am
possessed
whatever
may
then
remain
i
bequeath
to
my
aunt
leonella
when
i
am
dead
let
the
marquis
de
las
cisternas
know
that
his
brother's
unhappy
family
can
no
longer
importune
him
but
disappointment
makes
me
unjust
they
tell
me
that
he
is
ill
and
perhaps
had
it
been
in
his
power
he
wished
to
have
protected
me
tell
him
then
father
only
that
i
am
dead
and
that
if
he
had
any
faults
to
me
i
forgave
him
from
my
heart
this
done
i
have
nothing
more
to
ask
for
than
your
prayers
promise
to
remember
my
requests
and
i
shall
resign
my
life
without
a
pang
or
sorrow'
ambrosio
engaged
to
comply
with
her
desires
and
proceeded
to
give
her
absolution
every
moment
announced
the
approach
of
antonia's
fate
her
sight
failed
her
heart
beat
sluggishly
her
fingers
stiffened
and
grew
cold
and
at
two
in
the
morning
she
expired
without
a
groan
as
soon
as
the
breath
had
forsaken
her
body
father
pablos
retired
sincerely
affected
at
the
melancholy
scene
on
her
part
flora
gave
way
to
the
most
unbridled
sorrow
far
different
concerns
employed
ambrosio
he
sought
for
the
pulse
whose
throbbing
so
matilda
had
assured
him
would
prove
antonia's
death
but
temporal
he
found
it
he
pressed
it
it
palpitated
beneath
his
hand
and
his
heart
was
filled
with
ecstacy
however
he
carefully
concealed
his
satisfaction
at
the
success
of
his
plan
he
assumed
a
melancholy
air
and
addressing
himself
to
flora
warned
her
against
abandoning
herself
to
fruitless
sorrow
her
tears
were
too
sincere
to
permit
her
listening
to
his
counsels
and
she
continued
to
weep
unceasingly
the
friar
withdrew
first
promising
to
give
orders
himself
about
the
funeral
which
out
of
consideration
for
jacintha
as
he
pretended
should
take
place
with
all
expedition
plunged
in
grief
for
the
loss
of
her
beloved
mistress
flora
scarcely
attended
to
what
he
said
ambrosio
hastened
to
command
the
burial
he
obtained
permission
from
the
prioress
that
the
corse
should
be
deposited
in
st
clare's
sepulchre
and
on
the
friday
morning
every
proper
and
needful
ceremony
being
performed
antonia's
body
was
committed
to
the
tomb
on
the
same
day
leonella
arrived
at
madrid
intending
to
present
her
young
husband
to
elvira
various
circumstances
had
obliged
her
to
defer
her
journey
from
tuesday
to
friday
and
she
had
no
opportunity
of
making
this
alteration
in
her
plans
known
to
her
sister
as
her
heart
was
truly
affectionate
and
as
she
had
ever
entertained
a
sincere
regard
for
elvira
and
her
daughter
her
surprize
at
hearing
of
their
sudden
and
melancholy
fate
was
fully
equalled
by
her
sorrow
and
disappointment
ambrosio
sent
to
inform
her
of
antonia's
bequest
at
her
solication
he
promised
as
soon
as
elvira's
trifling
debts
were
discharged
to
transmit
to
her
the
remainder
this
being
settled
no
other
business
detained
leonella
in
madrid
and
she
returned
to
cordova
with
all
diligence
oh
could
i
worship
aught
beneath
the
skies
that
earth
hath
seen
or
fancy
could
devise
thine
altar
sacred
liberty
should
stand
built
by
no
mercenary
vulgar
hand
with
fragrant
turf
and
flowers
as
wild
and
fair
as
ever
dressed
a
bank
or
scented
summer
air
cowper
his
whole
attention
bent
upon
bringing
to
justice
the
assassins
of
his
sister
lorenzo
little
thought
how
severely
his
interest
was
suffering
in
another
quarter
as
was
before
mentioned
he
returned
not
to
madrid
till
the
evening
of
that
day
on
which
antonia
was
buried
signifying
to
the
grand
inquisitor
the
order
of
the
cardinal-duke
a
ceremony
not
to
be
neglected
when
a
member
of
the
church
was
to
be
arrested
publicly
communicating
his
design
to
his
uncle
and
don
ramirez
and
assembling
a
troop
of
attendants
sufficiently
to
prevent
opposition
furnished
him
with
full
occupation
during
the
few
hours
preceding
midnight
consequently
he
had
no
opportunity
to
enquire
about
his
mistress
and
was
perfectly
ignorant
both
of
her
death
and
her
mother's
the
marquis
was
by
no
means
out
of
danger
his
delirium
was
gone
but
had
left
him
so
much
exhausted
that
the
physicians
declined
pronouncing
upon
the
consequences
likely
to
ensue
as
for
raymond
himself
he
wished
for
nothing
more
earnestly
than
to
join
agnes
in
the
grave
existence
was
hateful
to
him
he
saw
nothing
in
the
world
deserving
his
attention
and
he
hoped
to
hear
that
agnes
was
revenged
and
himself
given
over
in
the
same
moment
followed
by
raymond's
ardent
prayers
for
success
lorenzo
was
at
the
gates
of
st
clare
a
full
hour
before
the
time
appointed
by
the
mother
st
ursula
he
was
accompanied
by
his
uncle
by
don
ramirez
de
mello
and
a
party
of
chosen
archers
though
in
considerable
numbers
their
appearance
created
no
surprize
a
great
crowd
was
already
assembled
before
the
convent
doors
in
order
to
witness
the
procession
it
was
naturally
supposed
that
lorenzo
and
his
attendants
were
conducted
thither
by
the
same
design
the
duke
of
medina
being
recognised
the
people
drew
back
and
made
way
for
his
party
to
advance
lorenzo
placed
himself
opposite
to
the
great
gate
through
which
the
pilgrims
were
to
pass
convinced
that
the
prioress
could
not
escape
him
he
waited
patiently
for
her
appearance
which
she
was
expected
to
make
exactly
at
midnight
the
nuns
were
employed
in
religious
duties
established
in
honour
of
st
clare
and
to
which
no
prophane
was
ever
admitted
the
chapel
windows
were
illuminated
as
they
stood
on
the
outside
the
auditors
heard
the
full
swell
of
the
organ
accompanied
by
a
chorus
of
female
voices
rise
upon
the
stillness
of
the
night
this
died
away
and
was
succeeded
by
a
single
strain
of
harmony
it
was
the
voice
of
her
who
was
destined
to
sustain
in
the
procession
the
character
of
st
clare
for
this
office
the
most
beautiful
virgin
of
madrid
was
always
selected
and
she
upon
whom
the
choice
fell
esteemed
it
as
the
highest
of
honours
while
listening
to
the
music
whose
melody
distance
only
seemed
to
render
sweeter
the
audience
was
wrapped
up
in
profound
attention
universal
silence
prevailed
through
the
crowd
and
every
heart
was
filled
with
reverence
for
religion
every
heart
but
lorenzo's
conscious
that
among
those
who
chaunted
the
praises
of
their
god
so
sweetly
there
were
some
who
cloaked
with
devotion
the
foulest
sins
their
hymns
inspired
him
with
detestation
at
their
hypocrisy
he
had
long
observed
with
disapprobation
and
contempt
the
superstition
which
governed
madrid's
inhabitants
his
good
sense
had
pointed
out
to
him
the
artifices
of
the
monks
and
the
gross
absurdity
of
their
miracles
wonders
and
supposititious
reliques
he
blushed
to
see
his
countrymen
the
dupes
of
deceptions
so
ridiculous
and
only
wished
for
an
opportunity
to
free
them
from
their
monkish
fetters
that
opportunity
so
long
desired
in
vain
was
at
length
presented
to
him
he
resolved
not
to
let
it
slip
but
to
set
before
the
people
in
glaring
colours
how
enormous
were
the
abuses
but
too
frequently
practised
in
monasteries
and
how
unjustly
public
esteem
was
bestowed
indiscriminately
upon
all
who
wore
a
religious
habit
he
longed
for
the
moment
destined
to
unmask
the
hypocrites
and
convince
his
countrymen
that
a
sanctified
exterior
does
not
always
hide
a
virtuous
heart
the
service
lasted
till
midnight
was
announced
by
the
convent
bell
that
sound
being
heard
the
music
ceased
the
voices
died
away
softly
and
soon
after
the
lights
disappeared
from
the
chapel
windows
lorenzo's
heart
beat
high
when
he
found
the
execution
of
his
plan
to
be
at
hand
from
the
natural
superstition
of
the
people
he
had
prepared
himself
for
some
resistance
but
he
trusted
that
the
mother
st
ursula
would
bring
good
reasons
to
justify
his
proceeding
he
had
force
with
him
to
repel
the
first
impulse
of
the
populace
till
his
arguments
should
be
heard
his
only
fear
was
lest
the
domina
suspecting
his
design
should
have
spirited
away
the
nun
on
whose
deposition
every
thing
depended
unless
the
mother
st
ursula
should
be
present
he
could
only
accuse
the
prioress
upon
suspicion
and
this
reflection
gave
him
some
little
apprehension
for
the
success
of
his
enterprize
the
tranquillity
which
seemed
to
reign
through
the
convent
in
some
degree
re-assured
him
still
he
expected
the
moment
eagerly
when
the
presence
of
his
ally
should
deprive
him
of
the
power
of
doubting
the
abbey
of
capuchins
was
only
separated
from
the
convent
by
the
garden
and
cemetery
the
monks
had
been
invited
to
assist
at
the
pilgrimage
they
now
arrived
marching
two
by
two
with
lighted
torches
in
their
hands
and
chaunting
hymns
in
honour
of
st
clare
father
pablos
was
at
their
head
the
abbot
having
excused
himself
from
attending
the
people
made
way
for
the
holy
train
and
the
friars
placed
themselves
in
ranks
on
either
side
of
the
great
gates
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
arrange
the
order
of
the
procession
this
being
settled
the
convent
doors
were
thrown
open
and
again
the
female
chorus
sounded
in
full
melody
first
appeared
a
band
of
choristers
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
the
monks
fell
in
two
by
two
and
followed
with
steps
slow
and
measured
next
came
the
novices
they
bore
no
tapers
as
did
the
professed
but
moved
on
with
eyes
bent
downwards
and
seemed
to
be
occupied
by
telling
their
beads
to
them
succeeded
a
young
and
lovely
girl
who
represented
st
lucia
she
held
a
golden
bason
in
which
were
two
eyes
her
own
were
covered
by
a
velvet
bandage
and
she
was
conducted
by
another
nun
habited
as
an
angel
she
was
followed
by
st
catherine
a
palm-branch
in
one
hand
a
flaming
sword
in
the
other
she
was
robed
in
white
and
her
brow
was
ornamented
with
a
sparkling
diadem
after
her
appeared
st
genevieve
surrounded
by
a
number
of
imps
who
putting
themselves
into
grotesque
attitudes
drawing
her
by
the
robe
and
sporting
round
her
with
antic
gestures
endeavoured
to
distract
her
attention
from
the
book
on
which
her
eyes
were
constantly
fixed
these
merry
devils
greatly
entertained
the
spectators
who
testified
their
pleasure
by
repeated
bursts
of
laughter
the
prioress
had
been
careful
to
select
a
nun
whose
disposition
was
naturally
solemn
and
saturnine
she
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
her
choice
the
drolleries
of
the
imps
were
entirely
thrown
away
and
st
genevieve
moved
on
without
discomposing
a
muscle
each
of
these
saints
was
separated
from
the
other
by
a
band
of
choristers
exalting
her
praise
in
their
hymns
but
declaring
her
to
be
very
much
inferior
to
st
clare
the
convent's
avowed
patroness
these
having
passed
a
long
train
of
nuns
appeared
bearing
like
the
choristers
each
a
burning
taper
next
came
the
reliques
of
st
clare
inclosed
in
vases
equally
precious
for
their
materials
and
workmanship
but
they
attracted
not
lorenzo's
attention
the
nun
who
bore
the
heart
occupied
him
entirely
according
to
theodore's
description
he
doubted
not
her
being
the
mother
st
ursula
she
seemed
to
look
round
with
anxiety
as
he
stood
foremost
in
the
rank
by
which
the
procession
past
her
eye
caught
lorenzo's
a
flush
of
joy
overspread
her
till
then
pallid
cheek
she
turned
to
her
companion
eagerly
'we
are
safe'
he
heard
her
whisper
''tis
her
brother'
his
heart
being
now
at
ease
lorenzo
gazed
with
tranquillity
upon
the
remainder
of
the
show
now
appeared
its
most
brilliant
ornament
it
was
a
machine
fashioned
like
a
throne
rich
with
jewels
and
dazzling
with
light
it
rolled
onwards
upon
concealed
wheels
and
was
guided
by
several
lovely
children
dressed
as
seraphs
the
summit
was
covered
with
silver
clouds
upon
which
reclined
the
most
beautiful
form
that
eyes
ever
witnessed
it
was
a
damsel
representing
st
clare
her
dress
was
of
inestimable
price
and
round
her
head
a
wreath
of
diamonds
formed
an
artificial
glory
but
all
these
ornaments
yielded
to
the
lustre
of
her
charms
as
she
advanced
a
murmur
of
delight
ran
through
the
crowd
even
lorenzo
confessed
secretly
that
he
never
beheld
more
perfect
beauty
and
had
not
his
heart
been
antonia's
it
must
have
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
this
enchanting
girl
as
it
was
he
considered
her
only
as
a
fine
statue
she
obtained
from
him
no
tribute
save
cold
admiration
and
when
she
had
passed
him
he
thought
of
her
no
more
'who
is
she'
asked
a
by-stander
in
lorenzo's
hearing
'one
whose
beauty
you
must
often
have
heard
celebrated
her
name
is
virginia
de
villa-franca
she
is
a
pensioner
of
st
clare's
convent
a
relation
of
the
prioress
and
has
been
selected
with
justice
as
the
ornament
of
the
procession'
the
throne
moved
onwards
it
was
followed
by
the
prioress
herself
she
marched
at
the
head
of
the
remaining
nuns
with
a
devout
and
sanctified
air
and
closed
the
procession
she
moved
on
slowly
her
eyes
were
raised
to
heaven
her
countenance
calm
and
tranquil
seemed
abstracted
from
all
sublunary
things
and
no
feature
betrayed
her
secret
pride
at
displaying
the
pomp
and
opulence
of
her
convent
she
passed
along
accompanied
by
the
prayers
and
benedictions
of
the
populace
but
how
great
was
the
general
confusion
and
surprize
when
don
ramirez
starting
forward
challenged
her
as
his
prisoner
for
a
moment
amazement
held
the
domina
silent
and
immoveable
but
no
sooner
did
she
recover
herself
than
she
exclaimed
against
sacrilege
and
impiety
and
called
the
people
to
rescue
a
daughter
of
the
church
they
were
eagerly
preparing
to
obey
her
when
don
ramirez
protected
by
the
archers
from
their
rage
commanded
them
to
forbear
and
threatened
them
with
the
severest
vengeance
of
the
inquisition
at
that
dreaded
word
every
arm
fell
every
sword
shrunk
back
into
its
scabbard
the
prioress
herself
turned
pale
and
trembled
the
general
silence
convinced
her
that
she
had
nothing
to
hope
but
from
innocence
and
she
besought
don
ramirez
in
a
faultering
voice
to
inform
her
of
what
crime
she
was
accused
'that
you
shall
know
in
time'
replied
he
'but
first
i
must
secure
the
mother
st
ursula'
'the
mother
st
ursula'
repeated
the
domina
faintly
at
this
moment
casting
her
eyes
round
she
saw
near
her
lorenzo
and
the
duke
who
had
followed
don
ramirez
'ah
great
god'
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
together
with
a
frantic
air
'i
am
betrayed'
'betrayed'
replied
st
ursula
who
now
arrived
conducted
by
some
of
the
archers
and
followed
by
the
nun
her
companion
in
the
procession
'not
betrayed
but
discovered
in
me
recognise
your
accuser
you
know
not
how
well
i
am
instructed
in
your
guilt--segnor'
she
continued
turning
to
don
ramirez
'i
commit
myself
to
your
custody
i
charge
the
prioress
of
st
clare
with
murder
and
stake
my
life
for
the
justice
of
my
accusation'
a
general
cry
of
surprize
was
uttered
by
the
whole
audience
and
an
explanation
was
demanded
loudly
the
trembling
nuns
terrified
at
the
noise
and
universal
confusion
had
dispersed
and
fled
different
ways
some
regained
the
convent
others
sought
refuge
in
the
dwellings
of
their
relations
and
many
only
sensible
of
their
present
danger
and
anxious
to
escape
from
the
tumult
ran
through
the
streets
and
wandered
they
knew
not
whither
the
lovely
virginia
was
one
of
the
first
to
fly
and
in
order
that
she
might
be
better
seen
and
heard
the
people
desired
that
st
ursula
should
harangue
them
from
the
vacant
throne
the
nun
complied
she
ascended
the
glittering
machine
and
then
addressed
the
surrounding
multitude
as
follows
'however
strange
and
unseemly
may
appear
my
conduct
when
considered
to
be
adopted
by
a
female
and
a
nun
necessity
will
justify
it
most
fully
a
secret
an
horrible
secret
weighs
heavy
upon
my
soul
no
rest
can
be
mine
till
i
have
revealed
it
to
the
world
and
satisfied
that
innocent
blood
which
calls
from
the
grave
for
vengeance
much
have
i
dared
to
gain
this
opportunity
of
lightening
my
conscience
had
i
failed
in
my
attempt
to
reveal
the
crime
had
the
domina
but
suspected
that
the
mystery
was
none
to
me
my
ruin
was
inevitable
angels
who
watch
unceasingly
over
those
who
deserve
their
favour
have
enabled
me
to
escape
detection
i
am
now
at
liberty
to
relate
a
tale
whose
circumstances
will
freeze
every
honest
soul
with
horror
mine
is
the
task
to
rend
the
veil
from
hypocrisy
and
show
misguided
parents
to
what
dangers
the
woman
is
exposed
who
falls
under
the
sway
of
a
monastic
tyrant
'among
the
votaries
of
st
clare
none
was
more
lovely
none
more
gentle
than
agnes
de
medina
i
knew
her
well
she
entrusted
to
me
every
secret
of
her
heart
i
was
her
friend
and
confident
and
i
loved
her
with
sincere
affection
nor
was
i
singular
in
my
attachment
her
piety
unfeigned
her
willingness
to
oblige
and
her
angelic
disposition
rendered
her
the
darling
of
all
that
was
estimable
in
the
convent
the
prioress
herself
proud
scrupulous
and
forbidding
could
not
refuse
agnes
that
tribute
of
approbation
which
she
bestowed
upon
no
one
else
every
one
has
some
fault
alas
agnes
had
her
weakness
she
violated
the
laws
of
our
order
and
incurred
the
inveterate
hate
of
the
unforgiving
domina
st
clare's
rules
are
severe
but
grown
antiquated
and
neglected
many
of
late
years
have
either
been
forgotten
or
changed
by
universal
consent
into
milder
punishments
the
penance
adjudged
to
the
crime
of
agnes
was
most
cruel
most
inhuman
the
law
had
been
long
exploded
alas
it
still
existed
and
the
revengeful
prioress
now
determined
to
revive
it
this
law
decreed
that
the
offender
should
be
plunged
into
a
private
dungeon
expressly
constituted
to
hide
from
the
world
for
ever
the
victim
of
cruelty
and
tyrannic
superstition
in
this
dreadful
abode
she
was
to
lead
a
perpetual
solitude
deprived
of
all
society
and
believed
to
be
dead
by
those
whom
affection
might
have
prompted
to
attempt
her
rescue
thus
was
she
to
languish
out
the
remainder
of
her
days
with
no
other
food
than
bread
and
water
and
no
other
comfort
than
the
free
indulgence
of
her
tears'
the
indignation
created
by
this
account
was
so
violent
as
for
some
moments
to
interrupt
st
ursula's
narrative
when
the
disturbance
ceased
and
silence
again
prevailed
through
the
assembly
she
continued
her
discourse
while
at
every
word
the
domina's
countenance
betrayed
her
increasing
terrors
'a
council
of
the
twelve
elder
nuns
was
called
i
was
of
the
number
the
prioress
in
exaggerated
colours
described
the
offence
of
agnes
and
scrupled
not
to
propose
the
revival
of
this
almost
forgotten
law
to
the
shame
of
our
sex
be
it
spoken
that
either
so
absolute
was
the
domina's
will
in
the
convent
or
so
much
had
disappointment
solitude
and
self-denial
hardened
their
hearts
and
sowered
their
tempers
that
this
barbarous
proposal
was
assented
to
by
nine
voices
out
of
the
twelve
i
was
not
one
of
the
nine
frequent
opportunities
had
convinced
me
of
the
virtues
of
agnes
and
i
loved
and
pitied
her
most
sincerely
the
mothers
bertha
and
cornelia
joined
my
party
we
made
the
strongest
opposition
possible
and
the
superior
found
herself
compelled
to
change
her
intention
in
spite
of
the
majority
in
her
favour
she
feared
to
break
with
us
openly
she
knew
that
supported
by
the
medina
family
our
forces
would
be
too
strong
for
her
to
cope
with
and
she
also
knew
that
after
being
once
imprisoned
and
supposed
dead
should
agnes
be
discovered
her
ruin
would
be
inevitable
she
therefore
gave
up
her
design
though
which
much
reluctance
she
demanded
some
days
to
reflect
upon
a
mode
of
punishment
which
might
be
agreeable
to
the
whole
community
and
she
promised
that
as
soon
as
her
resolution
was
fixed
the
same
council
should
be
again
summoned
two
days
passed
away
on
the
evening
of
the
third
it
was
announced
that
on
the
next
day
agnes
should
be
examined
and
that
according
to
her
behaviour
on
that
occasion
her
punishment
should
be
either
strengthened
or
mitigated
'on
the
night
preceding
this
examination
i
stole
to
the
cell
of
agnes
at
an
hour
when
i
supposed
the
other
nuns
to
be
buried
in
sleep
i
comforted
her
to
the
best
of
my
power
i
bad
her
take
courage
told
her
to
rely
upon
the
support
of
her
friends
and
taught
her
certain
signs
by
which
i
might
instruct
her
to
answer
the
domina's
questions
by
an
assent
or
negative
conscious
that
her
enemy
would
strive
to
confuse
embarrass
and
daunt
her
i
feared
her
being
ensnared
into
some
confession
prejudicial
to
her
interests
being
anxious
to
keep
my
visit
secret
i
stayed
with
agnes
but
a
short
time
i
bad
her
not
let
her
spirits
be
cast
down
i
mingled
my
tears
with
those
which
streamed
down
her
cheek
embraced
her
fondly
and
was
on
the
point
of
retiring
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
steps
approaching
the
cell
i
started
back
a
curtain
which
veiled
a
large
crucifix
offered
me
a
retreat
and
i
hastened
to
place
myself
behind
it
the
door
opened
the
prioress
entered
followed
by
four
other
nuns
they
advanced
towards
the
bed
of
agnes
the
superior
reproached
her
with
her
errors
in
the
bitterest
terms
she
told
her
that
she
was
a
disgrace
to
the
convent
that
she
was
resolved
to
deliver
the
world
and
herself
from
such
a
monster
and
commanded
her
to
drink
the
contents
of
a
goblet
now
presented
to
her
by
one
of
the
nuns
aware
of
the
fatal
properties
of
the
liquor
and
trembling
to
find
herself
upon
the
brink
of
eternity
the
unhappy
girl
strove
to
excite
the
domina's
pity
by
the
most
affecting
prayers
she
sued
for
life
in
terms
which
might
have
melted
the
heart
of
a
fiend
she
promised
to
submit
patiently
to
any
punishment
to
shame
imprisonment
and
torture
might
she
but
be
permitted
to
live
oh
might
she
but
live
another
month
or
week
or
day
her
merciless
enemy
listened
to
her
complaints
unmoved
she
told
her
that
at
first
she
meant
to
have
spared
her
life
and
that
if
she
had
altered
her
intention
she
had
to
thank
the
opposition
of
her
friends
she
continued
to
insist
upon
her
swallowing
the
poison
she
bad
her
recommend
herself
to
the
almighty's
mercy
not
to
hers
and
assured
her
that
in
an
hour
she
would
be
numbered
with
the
dead
perceiving
that
it
was
vain
to
implore
this
unfeeling
woman
she
attempted
to
spring
from
her
bed
and
call
for
assistance
she
hoped
if
she
could
not
escape
the
fate
announced
to
her
at
least
to
have
witnesses
of
the
violence
committed
the
prioress
guessed
her
design
she
seized
her
forcibly
by
the
arm
and
pushed
her
back
upon
her
pillow
at
the
same
time
drawing
a
dagger
and
placing
it
at
the
breast
of
the
unfortunate
agnes
she
protested
that
if
she
uttered
a
single
cry
or
hesitated
a
single
moment
to
drink
the
poison
she
would
pierce
her
heart
that
instant
already
half-dead
with
fear
she
could
make
no
further
resistance
the
nun
approached
with
the
fatal
goblet
the
domina
obliged
her
to
take
it
and
swallow
the
contents
she
drank
and
the
horrid
deed
was
accomplished
the
nuns
then
seated
themselves
round
the
bed
they
answered
her
groans
with
reproaches
they
interrupted
with
sarcasms
the
prayers
in
which
she
recommended
her
parting
soul
to
mercy
they
threatened
her
with
heaven's
vengeance
and
eternal
perdition
they
bad
her
despair
of
pardon
and
strowed
with
yet
sharper
thorns
death's
painful
pillow
such
were
the
sufferings
of
this
young
unfortunate
till
released
by
fate
from
the
malice
of
her
tormentors
she
expired
in
horror
of
the
past
in
fears
for
the
future
and
her
agonies
were
such
as
must
have
amply
gratified
the
hate
and
vengeance
of
her
enemies
as
soon
as
her
victim
ceased
to
breathe
the
domina
retired
and
was
followed
by
her
accomplices
'it
was
now
that
i
ventured
from
my
concealment
i
dared
not
to
assist
my
unhappy
friend
aware
that
without
preserving
her
i
should
only
have
brought
on
myself
the
same
destruction
shocked
and
terrified
beyond
expression
at
this
horrid
scene
scarcely
had
i
sufficient
strength
to
regain
my
cell
as
i
reached
the
door
of
that
of
agnes
i
ventured
to
look
towards
the
bed
on
which
lay
her
lifeless
body
once
so
lovely
and
so
sweet
i
breathed
a
prayer
for
her
departed
spirit
and
vowed
to
revenge
her
death
by
the
shame
and
punishment
of
her
assassins
with
danger
and
difficulty

i
kept
my
oath
i
unwarily
dropped
some
words
at
the
funeral
of
agnes
while
thrown
off
my
guard
by
excessive
grief
which
alarmed
the
guilty
conscience
of
the
prioress
my
every
action
was
observed
my
every
step
was
traced
i
was
constantly
surrounded
by
the
superior's
spies
it
was
long
before
i
could
find
the
means
of
conveying
to
the
unhappy
girl's
relations
an
intimation
of
my
secret
it
was
given
out
that
agnes
had
expired
suddenly
this
account
was
credited
not
only
by
her
friends
in
madrid
but
even
by
those
within
the
convent
the
poison
had
left
no
marks
upon
her
body
no
one
suspected
the
true
cause
of
her
death
and
it
remained
unknown
to
all
save
the
assassins
and
myself
'i
have
no
more
to
say
for
what
i
have
already
said
i
will
answer
with
my
life
i
repeat
that
the
prioress
is
a
murderess
that
she
has
driven
from
the
world
perhaps
from
heaven
an
unfortunate
whose
offence
was
light
and
venial
that
she
has
abused
the
power
intrusted
to
her
hands
and
has
been
a
tyrant
a
barbarian
and
an
hypocrite
i
also
accuse
the
four
nuns
violante
camilla
alix
and
mariana
as
being
her
accomplices
and
equally
criminal'
here
st
ursula
ended
her
narrative
it
created
horror
and
surprize
throughout
but
when
she
related
the
inhuman
murder
of
agnes
the
indignation
of
the
mob
was
so
audibly
testified
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
hear
the
conclusion
this
confusion
increased
with
every
moment
at
length
a
multitude
of
voices
exclaimed
that
the
prioress
should
be
given
up
to
their
fury
to
this
don
ramirez
refused
to
consent
positively
even
lorenzo
bad
the
people
remember
that
she
had
undergone
no
trial
and
advised
them
to
leave
her
punishment
to
the
inquisition
all
representations
were
fruitless
the
disturbance
grew
still
more
violent
and
the
populace
more
exasperated
in
vain
did
ramirez
attempt
to
convey
his
prisoner
out
of
the
throng
wherever
he
turned
a
band
of
rioters
barred
his
passage
and
demanded
her
being
delivered
over
to
them
more
loudly
than
before
ramirez
ordered
his
attendants
to
cut
their
way
through
the
multitude
oppressed
by
numbers
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
draw
their
swords
he
threatened
the
mob
with
the
vengeance
of
the
inquisition
but
in
this
moment
of
popular
phrenzy
even
this
dreadful
name
had
lost
its
effect
though
regret
for
his
sister
made
him
look
upon
the
prioress
with
abhorrence
lorenzo
could
not
help
pitying
a
woman
in
a
situation
so
terrible
but
in
spite
of
all
his
exertions
and
those
of
the
duke
of
don
ramirez
and
the
archers
the
people
continued
to
press
onwards
they
forced
a
passage
through
the
guards
who
protected
their
destined
victim
dragged
her
from
her
shelter
and
proceeded
to
take
upon
her
a
most
summary
and
cruel
vengeance
wild
with
terror
and
scarcely
knowing
what
she
said
the
wretched
woman
shrieked
for
a
moment's
mercy
she
protested
that
she
was
innocent
of
the
death
of
agnes
and
could
clear
herself
from
the
suspicion
beyond
the
power
of
doubt
the
rioters
heeded
nothing
but
the
gratification
of
their
barbarous
vengeance
they
refused
to
listen
to
her
they
showed
her
every
sort
of
insult
loaded
her
with
mud
and
filth
and
called
her
by
the
most
opprobrious
appellations
they
tore
her
one
from
another
and
each
new
tormentor
was
more
savage
than
the
former
they
stifled
with
howls
and
execrations
her
shrill
cries
for
mercy
and
dragged
her
through
the
streets
spurning
her
trampling
her
and
treating
her
with
every
species
of
cruelty
which
hate
or
vindictive
fury
could
invent
at
length
a
flint
aimed
by
some
well-directing
hand
struck
her
full
upon
the
temple
she
sank
upon
the
ground
bathed
in
blood
and
in
a
few
minutes
terminated
her
miserable
existence
yet
though
she
no
longer
felt
their
insults
the
rioters
still
exercised
their
impotent
rage
upon
her
lifeless
body
they
beat
it
trod
upon
it
and
ill-used
it
till
it
became
no
more
than
a
mass
of
flesh
unsightly
shapeless
and
disgusting
unable
to
prevent
this
shocking
event
lorenzo
and
his
friends
had
beheld
it
with
the
utmost
horror
but
they
were
rouzed
from
their
compelled
inactivity
on
hearing
that
the
mob
was
attacking
the
convent
of
st
clare
the
incensed
populace
confounding
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
had
resolved
to
sacrifice
all
the
nuns
of
that
order
to
their
rage
and
not
to
leave
one
stone
of
the
building
upon
another
alarmed
at
this
intelligence
they
hastened
to
the
convent
resolved
to
defend
it
if
possible
or
at
least
to
rescue
the
inhabitants
from
the
fury
of
the
rioters
most
of
the
nuns
had
fled
but
a
few
still
remained
in
their
habitation
their
situation
was
truly
dangerous
however
as
they
had
taken
the
precaution
of
fastening
the
inner
gates
with
this
assistance
lorenzo
hoped
to
repel
the
mob
till
don
ramirez
should
return
to
him
with
a
more
sufficient
force
having
been
conducted
by
the
former
disturbance
to
the
distance
of
some
streets
from
the
convent
he
did
not
immediately
reach
it
when
he
arrived
the
throng
surrounding
it
was
so
excessive
as
to
prevent
his
approaching
the
gates
in
the
interim
the
populace
besieged
the
building
with
persevering
rage
they
battered
the
walls
threw
lighted
torches
in
at
the
windows
and
swore
that
by
break
of
day
not
a
nun
of
st
clare's
order
should
be
left
alive
lorenzo
had
just
succeeded
in
piercing
his
way
through
the
crowd
when
one
of
the
gates
was
forced
open
the
rioters
poured
into
the
interior
part
of
the
building
where
they
exercised
their
vengeance
upon
every
thing
which
found
itself
in
their
passage
they
broke
the
furniture
into
pieces
tore
down
the
pictures
destroyed
the
reliques
and
in
their
hatred
of
her
servant
forgot
all
respect
to
the
saint
some
employed
themselves
in
searching
out
the
nuns
others
in
pulling
down
parts
of
the
convent
and
others
again
in
setting
fire
to
the
pictures
and
valuable
furniture
which
it
contained
these
latter
produced
the
most
decisive
desolation
indeed
the
consequences
of
their
action
were
more
sudden
than
themselves
had
expected
or
wished
the
flames
rising
from
the
burning
piles
caught
part
of
the
building
which
being
old
and
dry
the
conflagration
spread
with
rapidity
from
room
to
room
the
walls
were
soon
shaken
by
the
devouring
element
the
columns
gave
way
the
roofs
came
tumbling
down
upon
the
rioters
and
crushed
many
of
them
beneath
their
weight
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
shrieks
and
groans
the
convent
was
wrapped
in
flames
and
the
whole
presented
a
scene
of
devastation
and
horror
lorenzo
was
shocked
at
having
been
the
cause
however
innocent
of
this
frightful
disturbance
he
endeavoured
to
repair
his
fault
by
protecting
the
helpless
inhabitants
of
the
convent
he
entered
it
with
the
mob
and
exerted
himself
to
repress
the
prevailing
fury
till
the
sudden
and
alarming
progress
of
the
flames
compelled
him
to
provide
for
his
own
safety
the
people
now
hurried
out
as
eagerly
as
they
had
before
thronged
in
but
their
numbers
clogging
up
the
doorway
and
the
fire
gaining
upon
them
rapidly
many
of
them
perished
ere
they
had
time
to
effect
their
escape
lorenzo's
good
fortune
directed
him
to
a
small
door
in
a
farther
aisle
of
the
chapel
the
bolt
was
already
undrawn
he
opened
the
door
and
found
himself
at
the
foot
of
st
clare's
sepulchre
here
he
stopped
to
breathe
the
duke
and
some
of
his
attendants
had
followed
him
and
thus
were
in
security
for
the
present
they
now
consulted
what
steps
they
should
take
to
escape
from
this
scene
of
disturbance
but
their
deliberations
were
considerably
interrupted
by
the
sight
of
volumes
of
fire
rising
from
amidst
the
convent's
massy
walls
by
the
noise
of
some
heavy
arch
tumbling
down
in
ruins
or
by
the
mingled
shrieks
of
the
nuns
and
rioters
either
suffocating
in
the
press
perishing
in
the
flames
or
crushed
beneath
the
weight
of
the
falling
mansion
lorenzo
enquired
whither
the
wicket
led
he
was
answered
to
the
garden
of
the
capuchins
and
it
was
resolved
to
explore
an
outlet
upon
that
side
accordingly
the
duke
raised
the
latch
and
passed
into
the
adjoining
cemetery
the
attendants
followed
without
ceremony
lorenzo
being
the
last
was
also
on
the
point
of
quitting
the
colonnade
when
he
saw
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
opened
softly
someone
looked
out
but
on
perceiving
strangers
uttered
a
loud
shriek
started
back
again
and
flew
down
the
marble
stairs
'what
can
this
mean'
cried
lorenzo
'here
is
some
mystery
concealed
follow
me
without
delay'
thus
saying
he
hastened
into
the
sepulchre
and
pursued
the
person
who
continued
to
fly
before
him
the
duke
knew
not
the
cause
of
his
exclamation
but
supposing
that
he
had
good
reasons
for
it
he
followed
him
without
hesitation
the
others
did
the
same
and
the
whole
party
soon
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
upper
door
having
been
left
open
the
neighbouring
flames
darted
from
above
a
sufficient
light
to
enable
lorenzo's
catching
a
glance
of
the
fugitive
running
through
the
long
passages
and
distant
vaults
but
when
a
sudden
turn
deprived
him
of
this
assistance
total
darkness
succeeded
and
he
could
only
trace
the
object
of
his
enquiry
by
the
faint
echo
of
retiring
feet
the
pursuers
were
now
compelled
to
proceed
with
caution
as
well
as
they
could
judge
the
fugitive
also
seemed
to
slacken
pace
for
they
heard
the
steps
follow
each
other
at
longer
intervals
they
at
length
were
bewildered
by
the
labyrinth
of
passages
and
dispersed
in
various
directions
carried
away
by
his
eagerness
to
clear
up
this
mystery
and
to
penetrate
into
which
he
was
impelled
by
a
movement
secret
and
unaccountable
lorenzo
heeded
not
this
circumstance
till
he
found
himself
in
total
solitude
the
noise
of
footsteps
had
ceased
all
was
silent
around
and
no
clue
offered
itself
to
guide
him
to
the
flying
person
he
stopped
to
reflect
on
the
means
most
likely
to
aid
his
pursuit
he
was
persuaded
that
no
common
cause
would
have
induced
the
fugitive
to
seek
that
dreary
place
at
an
hour
so
unusual
the
cry
which
he
had
heard
seemed
uttered
in
a
voice
of
terror
and
he
was
convinced
that
some
mystery
was
attached
to
this
event
after
some
minutes
past
in
hesitation
he
continued
to
proceed
feeling
his
way
along
the
walls
of
the
passage
he
had
already
past
some
time
in
this
slow
progress
when
he
descried
a
spark
of
light
glimmering
at
a
distance
guided
by
this
observation
and
having
drawn
his
sword
he
bent
his
steps
towards
the
place
whence
the
beam
seemed
to
be
emitted
it
proceeded
from
the
lamp
which
flamed
before
st
clare's
statue
before
it
stood
several
females
their
white
garments
streaming
in
the
blast
as
it
howled
along
the
vaulted
dungeons
curious
to
know
what
had
brought
them
together
in
this
melancholy
spot
lorenzo
drew
near
with
precaution
the
strangers
seemed
earnestly
engaged
in
conversation
they
heard
not
lorenzo's
steps
and
he
approached
unobserved
till
he
could
hear
their
voices
distinctly
'i
protest'
continued
she
who
was
speaking
when
he
arrived
and
to
whom
the
rest
were
listening
with
great
attention
'i
protest
that
i
saw
them
with
my
own
eyes
i
flew
down
the
steps
they
pursued
me
and
i
escaped
falling
into
their
hands
with
difficulty
had
it
not
been
for
the
lamp
i
should
never
have
found
you'
'and
what
could
bring
them
hither'
said
another
in
a
trembling
voice
'do
you
think
that
they
were
looking
for
us'
'god
grant
that
my
fears
may
be
false'
rejoined
the
first
'but
i
doubt
they
are
murderers
if
they
discover
us
we
are
lost
as
for
me
my
fate
is
certain
my
affinity
to
the
prioress
will
be
a
sufficient
crime
to
condemn
me
and
though
till
now
these
vaults
have
afforded
me
a
retreat'
here
looking
up
her
eye
fell
upon
lorenzo
who
had
continued
to
approach
softly
'the
murderers'
she
cried--
she
started
away
from
the
statue's
pedestal
on
which
she
had
been
seated
and
attempted
to
escape
by
flight
her
companions
at
the
same
moment
uttered
a
terrified
scream
while
lorenzo
arrested
the
fugitive
by
the
arm
frightened
and
desperate
she
sank
upon
her
knees
before
him
'spare
me'
she
exclaimed
'for
christ's
sake
spare
me
i
am
innocent
indeed
i
am'
while
she
spoke
her
voice
was
almost
choaked
with
fear
the
beams
of
the
lamp
darting
full
upon
her
face
which
was
unveiled
lorenzo
recognized
the
beautiful
virginia
de
villa-franca
he
hastened
to
raise
her
from
the
ground
and
besought
her
to
take
courage
he
promised
to
protect
her
from
the
rioters
assured
her
that
her
retreat
was
still
a
secret
and
that
she
might
depend
upon
his
readiness
to
defend
her
to
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
during
this
conversation
the
nuns
had
thrown
themselves
into
various
attitudes
one
knelt
and
addressed
herself
to
heaven
another
hid
her
face
in
the
lap
of
her
neighbour
some
listened
motionless
with
fear
to
the
discourse
of
the
supposed
assassin
while
others
embraced
the
statue
of
st
clare
and
implored
her
protection
with
frantic
cries
on
perceiving
their
mistake
they
crowded
round
lorenzo
and
heaped
benedictions
on
him
by
dozens
he
found
that
on
hearing
the
threats
of
the
mob
and
terrified
by
the
cruelties
which
from
the
convent
towers
they
had
seen
inflicted
on
the
superior
many
of
the
pensioners
and
nuns
had
taken
refuge
in
the
sepulchre
among
the
former
was
to
be
reckoned
the
lovely
virginia
nearly
related
to
the
prioress
she
had
more
reason
than
the
rest
to
dread
the
rioters
and
now
besought
lorenzo
earnestly
not
to
abandon
her
to
their
rage
her
companions
most
of
whom
were
women
of
noble
family
made
the
same
request
which
he
readily
granted
he
promised
not
to
quit
them
till
he
had
seen
each
of
them
safe
in
the
arms
of
her
relations
but
he
advised
their
deferring
to
quit
the
sepulchre
for
some
time
longer
when
the
popular
fury
should
be
somewhat
calmed
and
the
arrival
of
military
force
have
dispersed
the
multitude
'would
to
god'
cried
virginia
'that
i
were
already
safe
in
my
mother's
embraces
how
say
you
segnor
will
it
be
long
ere
we
may
leave
this
place
every
moment
that
i
pass
here
i
pass
in
torture'
'i
hope
not
long'
said
he
'but
till
you
can
proceed
with
security
this
sepulchre
will
prove
an
impenetrable
asylum
here
you
run
no
risque
of
a
discovery
and
i
would
advise
your
remaining
quiet
for
the
next
two
or
three
hours'
'two
or
three
hours'
exclaimed
sister
helena
'if
i
stay
another
hour
in
these
vaults
i
shall
expire
with
fear
not
the
wealth
of
worlds
should
bribe
me
to
undergo
again
what
i
have
suffered
since
my
coming
hither
blessed
virgin
to
be
in
this
melancholy
place
in
the
middle
of
night
surrounded
by
the
mouldering
bodies
of
my
deceased
companions
and
expecting
every
moment
to
be
torn
in
pieces
by
their
ghosts
who
wander
about
me
and
complain
and
groan
and
wail
in
accents
that
make
my
blood
run
cold

christ
jesus
it
is
enough
to
drive
me
to
madness'
'excuse
me'
replied
lorenzo
'if
i
am
surprized
that
while
menaced
by
real
woes
you
are
capable
of
yielding
to
imaginary
dangers
these
terrors
are
puerile
and
groundless
combat
them
holy
sister
i
have
promised
to
guard
you
from
the
rioters
but
against
the
attacks
of
superstition
you
must
depend
for
protection
upon
yourself
the
idea
of
ghosts
is
ridiculous
in
the
extreme
and
if
you
continue
to
be
swayed
by
ideal
terrors
'
'ideal'
exclaimed
the
nuns
with
one
voice
'why
we
heard
it
ourselves
segnor
every
one
of
us
heard
it
it
was
frequently
repeated
and
it
sounded
every
time
more
melancholy
and
deep
you
will
never
persuade
me
that
we
could
all
have
been
deceived
not
we
indeed
no
no
had
the
noise
been
merely
created
by
fancy
'
'hark
hark'
interrupted
virginia
in
a
voice
of
terror
'god
preserve
us
there
it
is
again'
the
nuns
clasped
their
hands
together
and
sank
upon
their
knees
lorenzo
looked
round
him
eagerly
and
was
on
the
point
of
yielding
to
the
fears
which
already
had
possessed
the
women
universal
silence
prevailed
he
examined
the
vault
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
he
now
prepared
to
address
the
nuns
and
ridicule
their
childish
apprehensions
when
his
attention
was
arrested
by
a
deep
and
long-drawn
groan
'what
was
that'
he
cried
and
started
'there
segnor'
said
helena
'now
you
must
be
convinced
you
have
heard
the
noise
yourself
now
judge
whether
our
terrors
are
imaginary
since
we
have
been
here
that
groaning
has
been
repeated
almost
every
five
minutes
doubtless
it
proceeds
from
some
soul
in
pain
who
wishes
to
be
prayed
out
of
purgatory
but
none
of
us
here
dares
ask
it
the
question
as
for
me
were
i
to
see
an
apparition
the
fright
i
am
very
certain
would
kill
me
out
of
hand'
as
she
said
this
a
second
groan
was
heard
yet
more
distinctly
the
nuns
crossed
themselves
and
hastened
to
repeat
their
prayers
against
evil
spirits
lorenzo
listened
attentively
he
even
thought
that
he
could
distinguish
sounds
as
of
one
speaking
in
complaint
but
distance
rendered
them
inarticulate
the
noise
seemed
to
come
from
the
midst
of
the
small
vault
in
which
he
and
the
nuns
then
were
and
which
a
multitude
of
passages
branching
out
in
various
directions
formed
into
a
sort
of
star
lorenzo's
curiosity
which
was
ever
awake
made
him
anxious
to
solve
this
mystery
he
desired
that
silence
might
be
kept
the
nuns
obeyed
him
all
was
hushed
till
the
general
stillness
was
again
disturbed
by
the
groaning
which
was
repeated
several
times
successively
he
perceived
it
to
be
most
audible
when
upon
following
the
sound
he
was
conducted
close
to
the
shrine
of
st
clare
'the
noise
comes
from
hence'
said
he
'whose
is
this
statue'
helena
to
whom
he
addressed
the
question
paused
for
a
moment
suddenly
she
clapped
her
hands
together
'aye'
cried
she
'it
must
be
so
i
have
discovered
the
meaning
of
these
groans'
the
nuns
crowded
round
her
and
besought
her
eagerly
to
explain
herself
she
gravely
replied
that
for
time
immemorial
the
statue
had
been
famous
for
performing
miracles
from
this
she
inferred
that
the
saint
was
concerned
at
the
conflagration
of
a
convent
which
she
protected
and
expressed
her
grief
by
audible
lamentations
not
having
equal
faith
in
the
miraculous
saint
lorenzo
did
not
think
this
solution
of
the
mystery
quite
so
satisfactory
as
the
nuns
who
subscribed
to
it
without
hesitation
in
one
point
'tis
true
that
he
agreed
with
helena
he
suspected
that
the
groans
proceeded
from
the
statue
the
more
he
listened
the
more
was
he
confirmed
in
this
idea
he
drew
nearer
to
the
image
designing
to
inspect
it
more
closely
but
perceiving
his
intention
the
nuns
besought
him
for
god's
sake
to
desist
since
if
he
touched
the
statue
his
death
was
inevitable
'and
in
what
consists
the
danger'
said
he
'mother
of
god
in
what'
replied
helena
ever
eager
to
relate
a
miraculous
adventure
'if
you
had
only
heard
the
hundredth
part
of
those
marvellous
stories
about
this
statue
which
the
domina
used
to
recount
she
assured
us
often
and
often
that
if
we
only
dared
to
lay
a
finger
upon
it
we
might
expect
the
most
fatal
consequences
among
other
things
she
told
us
that
a
robber
having
entered
these
vaults
by
night
he
observed
yonder
ruby
whose
value
is
inestimable
do
you
see
it
segnor
it
sparkles
upon
the
third
finger
of
the
hand
in
which
she
holds
a
crown
of
thorns
this
jewel
naturally
excited
the
villain's
cupidity
he
resolved
to
make
himself
master
of
it
for
this
purpose
he
ascended
the
pedestal
he
supported
himself
by
grasping
the
saint's
right
arm
and
extended
his
own
towards
the
ring
what
was
his
surprize
when
he
saw
the
statue's
hand
raised
in
a
posture
of
menace
and
heard
her
lips
pronounce
his
eternal
perdition
penetrated
with
awe
and
consternation
he
desisted
from
his
attempt
and
prepared
to
quit
the
sepulchre
in
this
he
also
failed
flight
was
denied
him
he
found
it
impossible
to
disengage
the
hand
which
rested
upon
the
right
arm
of
the
statue
in
vain
did
he
struggle
he
remained
fixed
to
the
image
till
the
insupportable
and
fiery
anguish
which
darted
itself
through
his
veins
compelled
his
shrieking
for
assistance
the
sepulchre
was
now
filled
with
spectators
the
villain
confessed
his
sacrilege
and
was
only
released
by
the
separation
of
his
hand
from
his
body
it
has
remained
ever
since
fastened
to
the
image
the
robber
turned
hermit
and
led
ever
after
an
exemplary
life
but
yet
the
saint's
decree
was
performed
and
tradition
says
that
he
continues
to
haunt
this
sepulchre
and
implore
st
clare's
pardon
with
groans
and
lamentations
now
i
think
of
it
those
which
we
have
just
heard
may
very
possibly
have
been
uttered
by
the
ghost
of
this
sinner
but
of
this
i
will
not
be
positive
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
since
that
time
no
one
has
ever
dared
to
touch
the
statue
then
do
not
be
foolhardy
good
segnor
for
the
love
of
heaven
give
up
your
design
nor
expose
yourself
unnecessarily
to
certain
destruction'
not
being
convinced
that
his
destruction
would
be
so
certain
as
helena
seemed
to
think
it
lorenzo
persisted
in
his
resolution
the
nuns
besought
him
to
desist
in
piteous
terms
and
even
pointed
out
the
robber's
hand
which
in
effect
was
still
visible
upon
the
arm
of
the
statue
this
proof
as
they
imagined
must
convince
him
it
was
very
far
from
doing
so
and
they
were
greatly
scandalized
when
he
declared
his
suspicion
that
the
dried
and
shrivelled
fingers
had
been
placed
there
by
order
of
the
prioress
in
spite
of
their
prayers
and
threats
he
approached
the
statue
he
sprang
over
the
iron
rails
which
defended
it
and
the
saint
underwent
a
thorough
examination
the
image
at
first
appeared
to
be
of
stone
but
proved
on
further
inspection
to
be
formed
of
no
more
solid
materials
than
coloured
wood
he
shook
it
and
attempted
to
move
it
but
it
appeared
to
be
of
a
piece
with
the
base
which
it
stood
upon
he
examined
it
over
and
over
still
no
clue
guided
him
to
the
solution
of
this
mystery
for
which
the
nuns
were
become
equally
solicitous
when
they
saw
that
he
touched
the
statue
with
impunity
he
paused
and
listened
the
groans
were
repeated
at
intervals
and
he
was
convinced
of
being
in
the
spot
nearest
to
them
he
mused
upon
this
singular
event
and
ran
over
the
statue
with
enquiring
eyes
suddenly
they
rested
upon
the
shrivelled
hand
it
struck
him
that
so
particular
an
injunction
was
not
given
without
cause
not
to
touch
the
arm
of
the
image
he
again
ascended
the
pedestal
he
examined
the
object
of
his
attention
and
discovered
a
small
knob
of
iron
concealed
between
the
saint's
shoulder
and
what
was
supposed
to
have
been
the
hand
of
the
robber
this
observation
delighted
him
he
applied
his
fingers
to
the
knob
and
pressed
it
down
forcibly
immediately
a
rumbling
noise
was
heard
within
the
statue
as
if
a
chain
tightly
stretched
was
flying
back
startled
at
the
sound
the
timid
nuns
started
away
prepared
to
hasten
from
the
vault
at
the
first
appearance
of
danger
all
remaining
quiet
and
still
they
again
gathered
round
lorenzo
and
beheld
his
proceedings
with
anxious
curiosity
finding
that
nothing
followed
this
discovery
he
descended
as
he
took
his
hand
from
the
saint
she
trembled
beneath
his
touch
this
created
new
terrors
in
the
spectators
who
believed
the
statue
to
be
animated
lorenzo's
ideas
upon
the
subject
were
widely
different
he
easily
comprehended
that
the
noise
which
he
had
heard
was
occasioned
by
his
having
loosened
a
chain
which
attached
the
image
to
its
pedestal
he
once
more
attempted
to
move
it
and
succeeded
without
much
exertion
he
placed
it
upon
the
ground
and
then
perceived
the
pedestal
to
be
hollow
and
covered
at
the
opening
with
an
heavy
iron
grate
this
excited
such
general
curiosity
that
the
sisters
forgot
both
their
real
and
imaginary
dangers
lorenzo
proceeded
to
raise
the
grate
in
which
the
nuns
assisted
him
to
the
utmost
of
their
strength
the
attempt
was
accomplished
with
little
difficulty
a
deep
abyss
now
presented
itself
before
them
whose
thick
obscurity
the
eye
strove
in
vain
to
pierce
the
rays
of
the
lamp
were
too
feeble
to
be
of
much
assistance
nothing
was
discernible
save
a
flight
of
rough
unshapen
steps
which
sank
into
the
yawning
gulph
and
were
soon
lost
in
darkness
the
groans
were
heard
no
more
but
all
believed
them
to
have
ascended
from
this
cavern
as
he
bent
over
it
lorenzo
fancied
that
he
distinguished
something
bright
twinkling
through
the
gloom
he
gazed
attentively
upon
the
spot
where
it
showed
itself
and
was
convinced
that
he
saw
a
small
spark
of
light
now
visible
now
disappearing
he
communicated
this
circumstance
to
the
nuns
they
also
perceived
the
spark
but
when
he
declared
his
intention
to
descend
into
the
cave
they
united
to
oppose
his
resolution
all
their
remonstrances
could
not
prevail
on
him
to
alter
it
none
of
them
had
courage
enough
to
accompany
him
neither
could
he
think
of
depriving
them
of
the
lamp
alone
therefore
and
in
darkness
he
prepared
to
pursue
his
design
while
the
nuns
were
contented
to
offer
up
prayers
for
his
success
and
safety
the
steps
were
so
narrow
and
uneven
that
to
descend
them
was
like
walking
down
the
side
of
a
precipice
the
obscurity
by
which
he
was
surrounded
rendered
his
footing
insecure
he
was
obliged
to
proceed
with
great
caution
lest
he
should
miss
the
steps
and
fall
into
the
gulph
below
him
this
he
was
several
times
on
the
point
of
doing
however
he
arrived
sooner
upon
solid
ground
than
he
had
expected
he
now
found
that
the
thick
darkness
and
impenetrable
mists
which
reigned
through
the
cavern
had
deceived
him
into
the
belief
of
its
being
much
more
profound
than
it
proved
upon
inspection
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
unhurt
he
now
stopped
and
looked
round
for
the
spark
which
had
before
caught
his
attention
he
sought
it
in
vain
all
was
dark
and
gloomy
he
listened
for
the
groans
but
his
ear
caught
no
sound
except
the
distant
murmur
of
the
nuns
above
as
in
low
voices
they
repeated
their
ave-marias
he
stood
irresolute
to
which
side
he
should
address
his
steps
at
all
events
he
determined
to
proceed
he
did
so
but
slowly
fearing
lest
instead
of
approaching
he
should
be
retiring
from
the
object
of
his
search
the
groans
seemed
to
announce
one
in
pain
or
at
least
in
sorrow
and
he
hoped
to
have
the
power
of
relieving
the
mourner's
calamities
a
plaintive
tone
sounding
at
no
great
distance
at
length
reached
his
hearing
he
bent
his
course
joyfully
towards
it
it
became
more
audible
as
he
advanced
and
he
soon
beheld
again
the
spark
of
light
which
a
low
projecting
wall
had
hitherto
concealed
from
him
it
proceeded
from
a
small
lamp
which
was
placed
upon
an
heap
of
stones
and
whose
faint
and
melancholy
rays
served
rather
to
point
out
than
dispell
the
horrors
of
a
narrow
gloomy
dungeon
formed
in
one
side
of
the
cavern
it
also
showed
several
other
recesses
of
similar
construction
but
whose
depth
was
buried
in
obscurity
coldly
played
the
light
upon
the
damp
walls
whose
dew-stained
surface
gave
back
a
feeble
reflection
a
thick
and
pestilential
fog
clouded
the
height
of
the
vaulted
dungeon
as
lorenzo
advanced
he
felt
a
piercing
chillness
spread
itself
through
his
veins
the
frequent
groans
still
engaged
him
to
move
forwards
he
turned
towards
them
and
by
the
lamp's
glimmering
beams
beheld
in
a
corner
of
this
loathsome
abode
a
creature
stretched
upon
a
bed
of
straw
so
wretched
so
emaciated
so
pale
that
he
doubted
to
think
her
woman
she
was
half-naked
her
long
dishevelled
hair
fell
in
disorder
over
her
face
and
almost
entirely
concealed
it
one
wasted
arm
hung
listlessly
upon
a
tattered
rug
which
covered
her
convulsed
and
shivering
limbs
the
other
was
wrapped
round
a
small
bundle
and
held
it
closely
to
her
bosom
a
large
rosary
lay
near
her
opposite
to
her
was
a
crucifix
on
which
she
bent
her
sunk
eyes
fixedly
and
by
her
side
stood
a
basket
and
a
small
earthen
pitcher
lorenzo
stopped
he
was
petrified
with
horror
he
gazed
upon
the
miserable
object
with
disgust
and
pity
he
trembled
at
the
spectacle
he
grew
sick
at
heart
his
strength
failed
him
and
his
limbs
were
unable
to
support
his
weight
he
was
obliged
to
lean
against
the
low
wall
which
was
near
him
unable
to
go
forward
or
to
address
the
sufferer
she
cast
her
eyes
towards
the
staircase
the
wall
concealed
lorenzo
and
she
observed
him
not
'no
one
comes'
she
at
length
murmured
as
she
spoke
her
voice
was
hollow
and
rattled
in
her
throat
she
sighed
bitterly
'no
one
comes'
she
repeated
'no
they
have
forgotten
me
they
will
come
no
more'
she
paused
for
a
moment
then
continued
mournfully
'two
days
two
long
long
days
and
yet
no
food
and
yet
no
hope
no
comfort
foolish
woman
how
can
i
wish
to
lengthen
a
life
so
wretched
yet
such
a
death
o
god
to
perish
by
such
a
death
to
linger
out
such
ages
in
torture
till
now
i
knew
not
what
it
was
to
hunger
hark
no
no
one
comes
they
will
come
no
more'
she
was
silent
she
shivered
and
drew
the
rug
over
her
naked
shoulders
'i
am
very
cold
i
am
still
unused
to
the
damps
of
this
dungeon
'tis
strange
but
no
matter
colder
shall
i
soon
be
and
yet
not
feel
it--i
shall
be
cold
cold
as
thou
art'
she
looked
at
the
bundle
which
lay
upon
her
breast
she
bent
over
it
and
kissed
it
then
drew
back
hastily
and
shuddered
with
disgust
'it
was
once
so
sweet
it
would
have
been
so
lovely
so
like
him
i
have
lost
it
for
ever
how
a
few
days
have
changed
it
i
should
not
know
it
again
myself
yet
it
is
dear
to
me
god
how
dear
i
will
forget
what
it
is
i
will
only
remember
what
it
was
and
love
it
as
well
as
when
it
was
so
sweet
so
lovely
so
like
him
i
thought
that
i
had
wept
away
all
my
tears
but
here
is
one
still
lingering'
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
a
tress
of
her
hair
she
put
out
her
hand
for
the
pitcher
and
reached
it
with
difficulty
she
cast
into
it
a
look
of
hopeless
enquiry
she
sighed
and
replaced
it
upon
the
ground
'quite
a
void
not
a
drop
not
one
drop
left
to
cool
my
scorched-up
burning
palate
now
would
i
give
treasures
for
a
draught
of
water
and
they
are
god's
servants
who
make
me
suffer
thus
they
think
themselves
holy
while
they
torture
me
like
fiends
they
are
cruel
and
unfeeling
and
'tis
they
who
bid
me
repent
and
'tis
they
who
threaten
me
with
eternal
perdition
saviour
saviour
you
think
not
so'
she
again
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
crucifix
took
her
rosary
and
while
she
told
her
beads
the
quick
motion
of
her
lips
declared
her
to
be
praying
with
fervency
while
he
listened
to
her
melancholy
accents
lorenzo's
sensibility
became
yet
more
violently
affected
the
first
sight
of
such
misery
had
given
a
sensible
shock
to
his
feelings
but
that
being
past
he
now
advanced
towards
the
captive
she
heard
his
steps
and
uttering
a
cry
of
joy
dropped
the
rosary
'hark
hark
hark'
she
cried
'some
one
comes'
she
strove
to
raise
herself
but
her
strength
was
unequal
to
the
attempt
she
fell
back
and
as
she
sank
again
upon
the
bed
of
straw
lorenzo
heard
the
rattling
of
heavy
chains
he
still
approached
while
the
prisoner
thus
continued
'is
it
you
camilla
you
are
come
then
at
last
oh
it
was
time
i
thought
that
you
had
forsaken
me
that
i
was
doomed
to
perish
of
hunger
give
me
to
drink
camilla
for
pity's
sake
i
am
faint
with
long
fasting
and
grown
so
weak
that
i
cannot
raise
myself
from
the
ground
good
camilla
give
me
to
drink
lest
i
expire
before
you'
fearing
that
surprize
in
her
enfeebled
state
might
be
fatal
lorenzo
was
at
a
loss
how
to
address
her
'it
is
not
camilla'
said
he
at
length
speaking
in
a
slow
and
gentle
voice
'who
is
it
then'
replied
the
sufferer
'alix
perhaps
or
violante
my
eyes
are
grown
so
dim
and
feeble
that
i
cannot
distinguish
your
features
but
whichever
it
is
if
your
breast
is
sensible
of
the
least
compassion
if
you
are
not
more
cruel
than
wolves
and
tigers
take
pity
on
my
sufferings
you
know
that
i
am
dying
for
want
of
sustenance
this
is
the
third
day
since
these
lips
have
received
nourishment
do
you
bring
me
food
or
come
you
only
to
announce
my
death
and
learn
how
long
i
have
yet
to
exist
in
agony'
'you
mistake
my
business'
replied
lorenzo
'i
am
no
emissary
of
the
cruel
prioress
i
pity
your
sorrows
and
come
hither
to
relieve
them'
'to
relieve
them'
repeated
the
captive
'said
you
to
relieve
them'
at
the
same
time
starting
from
the
ground
and
supporting
herself
upon
her
hands
she
gazed
upon
the
stranger
earnestly
'great
god
it
is
no
illusion
a
man
speak
who
are
you
what
brings
you
hither
come
you
to
save
me
to
restore
me
to
liberty
to
life
and
light
oh
speak
speak
quickly
lest
i
encourage
an
hope
whose
disappointment
will
destroy
me'
'be
calm'
replied
lorenzo
in
a
voice
soothing
and
compassionate
'the
domina
of
whose
cruelty
you
complain
has
already
paid
the
forfeit
of
her
offences
you
have
nothing
more
to
fear
from
her
a
few
minutes
will
restore
you
to
liberty
and
the
embraces
of
your
friends
from
whom
you
have
been
secluded
you
may
rely
upon
my
protection
give
me
your
hand
and
be
not
fearful
let
me
conduct
you
where
you
may
receive
those
attentions
which
your
feeble
state
requires'
'oh
yes
yes
yes'
cried
the
prisoner
with
an
exulting
shriek
'there
is
a
god
then
and
a
just
one
joy
joy
i
shall
once
more
breath
the
fresh
air
and
view
the
light
of
the
glorious
sunbeams
i
will
go
with
you
stranger
i
will
go
with
you
oh
heaven
will
bless
you
for
pitying
an
unfortunate
but
this
too
must
go
with
me'
she
added
pointing
to
the
small
bundle
which
she
still
clasped
to
her
bosom
'i
cannot
part
with
this
i
will
bear
it
away
it
shall
convince
the
world
how
dreadful
are
the
abodes
so
falsely
termed
religious
good
stranger
lend
me
your
hand
to
rise
i
am
faint
with
want
and
sorrow
and
sickness
and
my
forces
have
quite
forsaken
me
so
that
is
well'
as
lorenzo
stooped
to
raise
her
the
beams
of
the
lamp
struck
full
upon
his
face
'almighty
god'
she
exclaimed
'is
it
possible
that
look
those
features
oh
yes
it
is
it
is
'
she
extended
her
arms
to
throw
them
round
him
but
her
enfeebled
frame
was
unable
to
sustain
the
emotions
which
agitated
her
bosom
she
fainted
and
again
sank
upon
the
bed
of
straw
lorenzo
was
surprized
at
her
last
exclamation
he
thought
that
he
had
before
heard
such
accents
as
her
hollow
voice
had
just
formed
but
where
he
could
not
remember
he
saw
that
in
her
dangerous
situation
immediate
physical
aid
was
absolutely
necessary
and
he
hastened
to
convey
her
from
the
dungeon
he
was
at
first
prevented
from
doing
so
by
a
strong
chain
fastened
round
the
prisoner's
body
and
fixing
her
to
the
neighbouring
wall
however
his
natural
strength
being
aided
by
anxiety
to
relieve
the
unfortunate
he
soon
forced
out
the
staple
to
which
one
end
of
the
chain
was
attached
then
taking
the
captive
in
his
arms
he
bent
his
course
towards
the
staircase
the
rays
of
the
lamp
above
as
well
as
the
murmur
of
female
voices
guided
his
steps
he
gained
the
stairs
and
in
a
few
minutes
after
arrived
at
the
iron-grate
the
nuns
during
his
absence
had
been
terribly
tormented
by
curiosity
and
apprehension
they
were
equally
surprized
and
delighted
on
seeing
him
suddenly
emerge
from
the
cave
every
heart
was
filled
with
compassion
for
the
miserable
creature
whom
he
bore
in
his
arms
while
the
nuns
and
virginia
in
particular
employed
themselves
in
striving
to
recall
her
to
her
senses
lorenzo
related
in
few
words
the
manner
of
his
finding
her
he
then
observed
to
them
that
by
this
time
the
tumult
must
have
been
quelled
and
that
he
could
now
conduct
them
to
their
friends
without
danger
all
were
eager
to
quit
the
sepulchre
still
to
prevent
all
possibility
of
ill-usage
they
besought
lorenzo
to
venture
out
first
alone
and
examine
whether
the
coast
was
clear
with
this
request
he
complied
helena
offered
to
conduct
him
to
the
staircase
and
they
were
on
the
point
of
departing
when
a
strong
light
flashed
from
several
passages
upon
the
adjacent
walls
at
the
same
time
steps
were
heard
of
people
approaching
hastily
and
whose
number
seemed
to
be
considerable
the
nuns
were
greatly
alarmed
at
this
circumstance
they
supposed
their
retreat
to
be
discovered
and
the
rioters
to
be
advancing
in
pursuit
of
them
hastily
quitting
the
prisoner
who
remained
insensible
they
crowded
round
lorenzo
and
claimed
his
promise
to
protect
them
virginia
alone
forgot
her
own
danger
by
striving
to
relieve
the
sorrows
of
another
she
supported
the
sufferer's
head
upon
her
knees
bathing
her
temples
with
rose-water
chafing
her
cold
hands
and
sprinkling
her
face
with
tears
which
were
drawn
from
her
by
compassion
the
strangers
approaching
nearer
lorenzo
was
enabled
to
dispel
the
fears
of
the
suppliants
his
name
pronounced
by
a
number
of
voices
among
which
he
distinguished
the
duke's
pealed
along
the
vaults
and
convinced
him
that
he
was
the
object
of
their
search
he
communicated
this
intelligence
to
the
nuns
who
received
it
with
rapture
a
few
moments
after
confirmed
his
idea
don
ramirez
as
well
as
the
duke
appeared
followed
by
attendants
with
torches
they
had
been
seeking
him
through
the
vaults
in
order
to
let
him
know
that
the
mob
was
dispersed
and
the
riot
entirely
over
lorenzo
recounted
briefly
his
adventure
in
the
cavern
and
explained
how
much
the
unknown
was
in
want
of
medical
assistance
he
besought
the
duke
to
take
charge
of
her
as
well
as
of
the
nuns
and
pensioners
'as
for
me'
said
he
'other
cares
demand
my
attention
while
you
with
one
half
of
the
archers
convey
these
ladies
to
their
respective
homes
i
wish
the
other
half
to
be
left
with
me
i
will
examine
the
cavern
below
and
pervade
the
most
secret
recesses
of
the
sepulchre
i
cannot
rest
till
convinced
that
yonder
wretched
victim
was
the
only
one
confined
by
superstition
in
these
vaults'
the
duke
applauded
his
intention
don
ramirez
offered
to
assist
him
in
his
enquiry
and
his
proposal
was
accepted
with
gratitude
the
nuns
having
made
their
acknowledgments
to
lorenzo
committed
themselves
to
the
care
of
his
uncle
and
were
conducted
from
the
sepulchre
virginia
requested
that
the
unknown
might
be
given
to
her
in
charge
and
promised
to
let
lorenzo
know
whenever
she
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
accept
his
visits
in
truth
she
made
this
promise
more
from
consideration
for
herself
than
for
either
lorenzo
or
the
captive
she
had
witnessed
his
politeness
gentleness
and
intrepidity
with
sensible
emotion
she
wished
earnestly
to
preserve
his
acquaintance
and
in
addition
to
the
sentiments
of
pity
which
the
prisoner
excited
she
hoped
that
her
attention
to
this
unfortunate
would
raise
her
a
degree
in
the
esteem
of
lorenzo
she
had
no
occasion
to
trouble
herself
upon
this
head
the
kindness
already
displayed
by
her
and
the
tender
concern
which
she
had
shown
for
the
sufferer
had
gained
her
an
exalted
place
in
his
good
graces
while
occupied
in
alleviating
the
captive's
sorrows
the
nature
of
her
employment
adorned
her
with
new
charms
and
rendered
her
beauty
a
thousand
times
more
interesting
lorenzo
viewed
her
with
admiration
and
delight
he
considered
her
as
a
ministering
angel
descended
to
the
aid
of
afflicted
innocence
nor
could
his
heart
have
resisted
her
attractions
had
it
not
been
steeled
by
the
remembrance
of
antonia
the
duke
now
conveyed
the
nuns
in
safety
to
the
dwellings
of
their
respective
friends
the
rescued
prisoner
was
still
insensible
and
gave
no
signs
of
life
except
by
occasional
groans
she
was
borne
upon
a
sort
of
litter
virginia
who
was
constantly
by
the
side
of
it
was
apprehensive
that
exhausted
by
long
abstinence
and
shaken
by
the
sudden
change
from
bonds
and
darkness
to
liberty
and
light
her
frame
would
never
get
the
better
of
the
shock
lorenzo
and
don
ramirez
still
remained
in
the
sepulchre
after
deliberating
upon
their
proceedings
it
was
resolved
that
to
prevent
losing
time
the
archers
should
be
divided
into
two
bodies
that
with
one
don
ramirez
should
examine
the
cavern
while
lorenzo
with
the
other
might
penetrate
into
the
further
vaults
this
being
arranged
and
his
followers
being
provided
with
torches
don
ramirez
advanced
to
the
cavern
he
had
already
descended
some
steps
when
he
heard
people
approaching
hastily
from
the
interior
part
of
the
sepulchre
this
surprized
him
and
he
quitted
the
cave
precipitately
'do
you
hear
footsteps'
said
lorenzo
'let
us
bend
our
course
towards
them
'tis
from
this
side
that
they
seem
to
proceed'
at
that
moment
a
loud
and
piercing
shriek
induced
him
to
quicken
his
steps
'help
help
for
god's
sake
cried
a
voice
whose
melodious
tone
penetrated
lorenzo's
heart
with
terror
he
flew
towards
the
cry
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
and
was
followed
by
don
ramirez
with
equal
swiftness
great
heaven
how
frail
thy
creature
man
is
made
how
by
himself
insensibly
betrayed
in
our
own
strength
unhappily
secure
too
little
cautious
of
the
adverse
power
on
pleasure's
flowery
brink
we
idly
stray
masters
as
yet
of
our
returning
way
till
the
strong
gusts
of
raging
passion
rise
till
the
dire
tempest
mingles
earth
and
skies
and
swift
into
the
boundless
ocean
borne
our
foolish
confidence
too
late
we
mourn
round
our
devoted
heads
the
billows
beat
and
from
our
troubled
view
the
lessening
lands
retreat
prior
all
this
while
ambrosio
was
unconscious
of
the
dreadful
scenes
which
were
passing
so
near
the
execution
of
his
designs
upon
antonia
employed
his
every
thought
hitherto
he
was
satisfied
with
the
success
of
his
plans
antonia
had
drank
the
opiate
was
buried
in
the
vaults
of
st
clare
and
absolutely
in
his
disposal
matilda
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
nature
and
effects
of
the
soporific
medicine
had
computed
that
it
would
not
cease
to
operate
till
one
in
the
morning
for
that
hour
he
waited
with
impatience
the
festival
of
st
clare
presented
him
with
a
favourable
opportunity
of
consummating
his
crime
he
was
certain
that
the
friars
and
nuns
would
be
engaged
in
the
procession
and
that
he
had
no
cause
to
dread
an
interruption
from
appearing
himself
at
the
head
of
his
monks
he
had
desired
to
be
excused
he
doubted
not
that
being
beyond
the
reach
of
help
cut
off
from
all
the
world
and
totally
in
his
power
antonia
would
comply
with
his
desires
the
affection
which
she
had
ever
exprest
for
him
warranted
this
persuasion
but
he
resolved
that
should
she
prove
obstinate
no
consideration
whatever
should
prevent
him
from
enjoying
her
secure
from
a
discovery
he
shuddered
not
at
the
idea
of
employing
force
if
he
felt
any
repugnance
it
arose
not
from
a
principle
of
shame
or
compassion
but
from
his
feeling
for
antonia
the
most
sincere
and
ardent
affection
and
wishing
to
owe
her
favours
to
no
one
but
herself
the
monks
quitted
the
abbey
at
midnight
matilda
was
among
the
choristers
and
led
the
chaunt
ambrosio
was
left
by
himself
and
at
liberty
to
pursue
his
own
inclinations
convinced
that
no
one
remained
behind
to
watch
his
motions
or
disturb
his
pleasures
he
now
hastened
to
the
western
aisles
his
heart
beating
with
hope
not
unmingled
with
anxiety
he
crossed
the
garden
unlocked
the
door
which
admitted
him
into
the
cemetery
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
stood
before
the
vaults
here
he
paused
he
looked
round
him
with
suspicion
conscious
that
his
business
was
unfit
for
any
other
eye
as
he
stood
in
hesitation
he
heard
the
melancholy
shriek
of
the
screech-owl
the
wind
rattled
loudly
against
the
windows
of
the
adjacent
convent
and
as
the
current
swept
by
him
bore
with
it
the
faint
notes
of
the
chaunt
of
choristers
he
opened
the
door
cautiously
as
if
fearing
to
be
overheard
he
entered
and
closed
it
again
after
him
guided
by
his
lamp
he
threaded
the
long
passages
in
whose
windings
matilda
had
instructed
him
and
reached
the
private
vault
which
contained
his
sleeping
mistress
its
entrance
was
by
no
means
easy
to
discover
but
this
was
no
obstacle
to
ambrosio
who
at
the
time
of
antonia's
funeral
had
observed
it
too
carefully
to
be
deceived
he
found
the
door
which
was
unfastened
pushed
it
open
and
descended
into
the
dungeon
he
approached
the
humble
tomb
in
which
antonia
reposed
he
had
provided
himself
with
an
iron
crow
and
a
pick-axe
but
this
precaution
was
unnecessary
the
grate
was
slightly
fastened
on
the
outside
he
raised
it
and
placing
the
lamp
upon
its
ridge
bent
silently
over
the
tomb
by
the
side
of
three
putrid
half-corrupted
bodies
lay
the
sleeping
beauty
a
lively
red
the
forerunner
of
returning
animation
had
already
spread
itself
over
her
cheek
and
as
wrapped
in
her
shroud
she
reclined
upon
her
funeral
bier
she
seemed
to
smile
at
the
images
of
death
around
her
while
he
gazed
upon
their
rotting
bones
and
disgusting
figures
who
perhaps
were
once
as
sweet
and
lovely
ambrosio
thought
upon
elvira
by
him
reduced
to
the
same
state
as
the
memory
of
that
horrid
act
glanced
upon
his
mind
it
was
clouded
with
a
gloomy
horror
yet
it
served
but
to
strengthen
his
resolution
to
destroy
antonia's
honour
'for
your
sake
fatal
beauty'
murmured
the
monk
while
gazing
on
his
devoted
prey
'for
your
sake
have
i
committed
this
murder
and
sold
myself
to
eternal
tortures
now
you
are
in
my
power
the
produce
of
my
guilt
will
at
least
be
mine
hope
not
that
your
prayers
breathed
in
tones
of
unequalled
melody
your
bright
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
your
hands
lifted
in
supplication
as
when
seeking
in
penitence
the
virgin's
pardon
hope
not
that
your
moving
innocence
your
beauteous
grief
or
all
your
suppliant
arts
shall
ransom
you
from
my
embraces
before
the
break
of
day
mine
you
must
and
mine
you
shall
be'
he
lifted
her
still
motionless
from
the
tomb
he
seated
himself
upon
a
bank
of
stone
and
supporting
her
in
his
arms
watched
impatiently
for
the
symptoms
of
returning
animation
scarcely
could
he
command
his
passions
sufficiently
to
restrain
himself
from
enjoying
her
while
yet
insensible
his
natural
lust
was
increased
in
ardour
by
the
difficulties
which
had
opposed
his
satisfying
it
as
also
by
his
long
abstinence
from
woman
since
from
the
moment
of
resigning
her
claim
to
his
love
matilda
had
exiled
him
from
her
arms
for
ever
'i
am
no
prostitute
ambrosio'
had
she
told
him
when
in
the
fullness
of
his
lust
he
demanded
her
favours
with
more
than
usual
earnestness
'i
am
now
no
more
than
your
friend
and
will
not
be
your
mistress
cease
then
to
solicit
my
complying
with
desires
which
insult
me
while
your
heart
was
mine
i
gloried
in
your
embraces
those
happy
times
are
past
my
person
is
become
indifferent
to
you
and
'tis
necessity
not
love
which
makes
you
seek
my
enjoyment
i
cannot
yield
to
a
request
so
humiliating
to
my
pride'
suddenly
deprived
of
pleasures
the
use
of
which
had
made
them
an
absolute
want
the
monk
felt
this
restraint
severely
naturally
addicted
to
the
gratification
of
the
senses
in
the
full
vigour
of
manhood
and
heat
of
blood
he
had
suffered
his
temperament
to
acquire
such
ascendency
that
his
lust
was
become
madness
of
his
fondness
for
antonia
none
but
the
grosser
particles
remained
he
longed
for
the
possession
of
her
person
and
even
the
gloom
of
the
vault
the
surrounding
silence
and
the
resistance
which
he
expected
from
her
seemed
to
give
a
fresh
edge
to
his
fierce
and
unbridled
desires
gradually
he
felt
the
bosom
which
rested
against
his
glow
with
returning
warmth
her
heart
throbbed
again
her
blood
flowed
swifter
and
her
lips
moved
at
length
she
opened
her
eyes
but
still
opprest
and
bewildered
by
the
effects
of
the
strong
opiate
she
closed
them
again
immediately
ambrosio
watched
her
narrowly
nor
permitted
a
movement
to
escape
him
perceiving
that
she
was
fully
restored
to
existence
he
caught
her
in
rapture
to
his
bosom
and
closely
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
the
suddenness
of
his
action
sufficed
to
dissipate
the
fumes
which
obscured
antonia's
reason
she
hastily
raised
herself
and
cast
a
wild
look
round
her
the
strange
images
which
presented
themselves
on
every
side
contributed
to
confuse
her
she
put
her
hand
to
her
head
as
if
to
settle
her
disordered
imagination
at
length
she
took
it
away
and
threw
her
eyes
through
the
dungeon
a
second
time
they
fixed
upon
the
abbot's
face
'where
am
i'
she
said
abruptly
'how
came
i
here
where
is
my
mother
methought
i
saw
her
oh
a
dream
a
dreadful
dreadful
dream
told
me

but
where
am
i
let
me
go
i
cannot
stay
here'
she
attempted
to
rise
but
the
monk
prevented
her
'be
calm
lovely
antonia'
he
replied
'no
danger
is
near
you
confide
in
my
protection
why
do
you
gaze
on
me
so
earnestly
do
you
not
know
me
not
know
your
friend
ambrosio'
'ambrosio
my
friend
oh
yes
yes
i
remember

but
why
am
i
here
who
has
brought
me
why
are
you
with
me
oh
flora
bad
me
beware

here
are
nothing
but
graves
and
tombs
and
skeletons
this
place
frightens
me
good
ambrosio
take
me
away
from
it
for
it
recalls
my
fearful
dream
methought
i
was
dead
and
laid
in
my
grave
good
ambrosio
take
me
from
hence
will
you
not
oh
will
you
not
do
not
look
on
me
thus
your
flaming
eyes
terrify
me
spare
me
father
oh
spare
me
for
god's
sake'
'why
these
terrors
antonia'
rejoined
the
abbot
folding
her
in
his
arms
and
covering
her
bosom
with
kisses
which
she
in
vain
struggled
to
avoid
'what
fear
you
from
me
from
one
who
adores
you
what
matters
it
where
you
are
this
sepulchre
seems
to
me
love's
bower
this
gloom
is
the
friendly
night
of
mystery
which
he
spreads
over
our
delights
such
do
i
think
it
and
such
must
my
antonia
yes
my
sweet
girl
yes
your
veins
shall
glow
with
fire
which
circles
in
mine
and
my
transports
shall
be
doubled
by
your
sharing
them'
while
he
spoke
thus
he
repeated
his
embraces
and
permitted
himself
the
most
indecent
liberties
even
antonia's
ignorance
was
not
proof
against
the
freedom
of
his
behaviour
she
was
sensible
of
her
danger
forced
herself
from
his
arms
and
her
shroud
being
her
only
garment
she
wrapped
it
closely
round
her
'unhand
me
father'
she
cried
her
honest
indignation
tempered
by
alarm
at
her
unprotected
position
'why
have
you
brought
me
to
this
place
its
appearance
freezes
me
with
horror
convey
me
from
hence
if
you
have
the
least
sense
of
pity
and
humanity
let
me
return
to
the
house
which
i
have
quitted
i
know
not
how
but
stay
here
one
moment
longer
i
neither
will
or
ought'
though
the
monk
was
somewhat
startled
by
the
resolute
tone
in
which
this
speech
was
delivered
it
produced
upon
him
no
other
effect
than
surprize
he
caught
her
hand
forced
her
upon
his
knee
and
gazing
upon
her
with
gloting
eyes
he
thus
replied
to
her
'compose
yourself
antonia
resistance
is
unavailing
and
i
need
disavow
my
passion
for
you
no
longer
you
are
imagined
dead
society
is
for
ever
lost
to
you
i
possess
you
here
alone
you
are
absolutely
in
my
power
and
i
burn
with
desires
which
i
must
either
gratify
or
die
but
i
would
owe
my
happiness
to
yourself
my
lovely
girl
my
adorable
antonia
let
me
instruct
you
in
joys
to
which
you
are
still
a
stranger
and
teach
you
to
feel
those
pleasures
in
my
arms
which
i
must
soon
enjoy
in
yours
nay
this
struggling
is
childish'
he
continued
seeing
her
repell
his
caresses
and
endeavour
to
escape
from
his
grasp
'no
aid
is
near
neither
heaven
or
earth
shall
save
you
from
my
embraces
yet
why
reject
pleasures
so
sweet
so
rapturous
no
one
observes
us
our
loves
will
be
a
secret
to
all
the
world
love
and
opportunity
invite
your
giving
loose
to
your
passions
yield
to
them
my
antonia
yield
to
them
my
lovely
girl
throw
your
arms
thus
fondly
round
me
join
your
lips
thus
closely
to
mine
amidst
all
her
gifts
has
nature
denied
her
most
precious
the
sensibility
of
pleasure
oh
impossible
every
feature
look
and
motion
declares
you
formed
to
bless
and
to
be
blessed
yourself
turn
not
on
me
those
supplicating
eyes
consult
your
own
charms
they
will
tell
you
that
i
am
proof
against
entreaty
can
i
relinquish
these
limbs
so
white
so
soft
so
delicate
these
swelling
breasts
round
full
and
elastic
these
lips
fraught
with
such
inexhaustible
sweetness
can
i
relinquish
these
treasures
and
leave
them
to
another's
enjoyment
no
antonia
never
never
i
swear
it
by
this
kiss
and
this
and
this'
with
every
moment
the
friar's
passion
became
more
ardent
and
antonia's
terror
more
intense
she
struggled
to
disengage
herself
from
his
arms
her
exertions
were
unsuccessful
and
finding
that
ambrosio's
conduct
became
still
freer
she
shrieked
for
assistance
with
all
her
strength
the
aspect
of
the
vault
the
pale
glimmering
of
the
lamp
the
surrounding
obscurity
the
sight
of
the
tomb
and
the
objects
of
mortality
which
met
her
eyes
on
either
side
were
ill-calculated
to
inspire
her
with
those
emotions
by
which
the
friar
was
agitated
even
his
caresses
terrified
her
from
their
fury
and
created
no
other
sentiment
than
fear
on
the
contrary
her
alarm
her
evident
disgust
and
incessant
opposition
seemed
only
to
inflame
the
monk's
desires
and
supply
his
brutality
with
additional
strength
antonia's
shrieks
were
unheard
yet
she
continued
them
nor
abandoned
her
endeavours
to
escape
till
exhausted
and
out
of
breath
she
sank
from
his
arms
upon
her
knees
and
once
more
had
recourse
to
prayers
and
supplications
this
attempt
had
no
better
success
than
the
former
on
the
contrary
taking
advantage
of
her
situation
the
ravisher
threw
himself
by
her
side
he
clasped
her
to
his
bosom
almost
lifeless
with
terror
and
faint
with
struggling
he
stifled
her
cries
with
kisses
treated
her
with
the
rudeness
of
an
unprincipled
barbarian
proceeded
from
freedom
to
freedom
and
in
the
violence
of
his
lustful
delirium
wounded
and
bruised
her
tender
limbs
heedless
of
her
tears
cries
and
entreaties
he
gradually
made
himself
master
of
her
person
and
desisted
not
from
his
prey
till
he
had
accomplished
his
crime
and
the
dishonour
of
antonia
scarcely
had
he
succeeded
in
his
design
than
he
shuddered
at
himself
and
the
means
by
which
it
was
effected
the
very
excess
of
his
former
eagerness
to
possess
antonia
now
contributed
to
inspire
him
with
disgust
and
a
secret
impulse
made
him
feel
how
base
and
unmanly
was
the
crime
which
he
had
just
committed
he
started
hastily
from
her
arms
she
who
so
lately
had
been
the
object
of
his
adoration
now
raised
no
other
sentiment
in
his
heart
than
aversion
and
rage
he
turned
away
from
her
or
if
his
eyes
rested
upon
her
figure
involuntarily
it
was
only
to
dart
upon
her
looks
of
hate
the
unfortunate
had
fainted
ere
the
completion
of
her
disgrace
she
only
recovered
life
to
be
sensible
of
her
misfortune
she
remained
stretched
upon
the
earth
in
silent
despair
the
tears
chased
each
other
slowly
down
her
cheeks
and
her
bosom
heaved
with
frequent
sobs
oppressed
with
grief
she
continued
for
some
time
in
this
state
of
torpidity
at
length
she
rose
with
difficulty
and
dragging
her
feeble
steps
towards
the
door
prepared
to
quit
the
dungeon
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
rouzed
the
monk
from
his
sullen
apathy
starting
from
the
tomb
against
which
he
reclined
while
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
images
of
corruption
contained
in
it
he
pursued
the
victim
of
his
brutality
and
soon
overtook
her
he
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
violently
forced
her
back
into
the
dungeon
'whither
go
you'
he
cried
in
a
stern
voice
'return
this
instant'
antonia
trembled
at
the
fury
of
his
countenance
'what
would
you
more'
she
said
with
timidity
'is
not
my
ruin
compleated
am
i
not
undone
undone
for
ever
is
not
your
cruelty
contented
or
have
i
yet
more
to
suffer
let
me
depart
let
me
return
to
my
home
and
weep
unrestrained
my
shame
and
my
affliction'
'return
to
your
home'
repeated
the
monk
with
bitter
and
contemptuous
mockery
then
suddenly
his
eyes
flaming
with
passion
'what
that
you
may
denounce
me
to
the
world
that
you
may
proclaim
me
an
hypocrite
a
ravisher
a
betrayer
a
monster
of
cruelty
lust
and
ingratitude
no
no
no
i
know
well
the
whole
weight
of
my
offences
well
that
your
complaints
would
be
too
just
and
my
crimes
too
notorious
you
shall
not
from
hence
to
tell
madrid
that
i
am
a
villain
that
my
conscience
is
loaded
with
sins
which
make
me
despair
of
heaven's
pardon
wretched
girl
you
must
stay
here
with
me
here
amidst
these
lonely
tombs
these
images
of
death
these
rotting
loathsome
corrupted
bodies
here
shall
you
stay
and
witness
my
sufferings
witness
what
it
is
to
die
in
the
horrors
of
despondency
and
breathe
the
last
groan
in
blasphemy
and
curses
and
who
am
i
to
thank
for
this
what
seduced
me
into
crimes
whose
bare
remembrance
makes
me
shudder
fatal
witch
was
it
not
thy
beauty
have
you
not
plunged
my
soul
into
infamy
have
you
not
made
me
a
perjured
hypocrite
a
ravisher
an
assassin
nay
at
this
moment
does
not
that
angel
look
bid
me
despair
of
god's
forgiveness
oh
when
i
stand
before
his
judgment-throne
that
look
will
suffice
to
damn
me
you
will
tell
my
judge
that
you
were
happy
till
i
saw
you
that
you
were
innocent
till
i
polluted
you
you
will
come
with
those
tearful
eyes
those
cheeks
pale
and
ghastly
those
hands
lifted
in
supplication
as
when
you
sought
from
me
that
mercy
which
i
gave
not
then
will
my
perdition
be
certain
then
will
come
your
mother's
ghost
and
hurl
me
down
into
the
dwellings
of
fiends
and
flames
and
furies
and
everlasting
torments
and
'tis
you
who
will
accuse
me
'tis
you
who
will
cause
my
eternal
anguish
you
wretched
girl
you
you'
as
he
thundered
out
these
words
he
violently
grasped
antonia's
arm
and
spurned
the
earth
with
delirious
fury
supposing
his
brain
to
be
turned
antonia
sank
in
terror
upon
her
knees
she
lifted
up
her
hands
and
her
voice
almost
died
away
ere
she
could
give
it
utterance
'spare
me
spare
me'
she
murmured
with
difficulty
'silence'
cried
the
friar
madly
and
dashed
her
upon
the
ground----
he
quitted
her
and
paced
the
dungeon
with
a
wild
and
disordered
air
his
eyes
rolled
fearfully
antonia
trembled
whenever
she
met
their
gaze
he
seemed
to
meditate
on
something
horrible
and
she
gave
up
all
hopes
of
escaping
from
the
sepulchre
with
life
yet
in
harbouring
this
idea
she
did
him
injustice
amidst
the
horror
and
disgust
to
which
his
soul
was
a
prey
pity
for
his
victim
still
held
a
place
in
it
the
storm
of
passion
once
over
he
would
have
given
worlds
had
he
possest
them
to
have
restored
to
her
that
innocence
of
which
his
unbridled
lust
had
deprived
her
of
the
desires
which
had
urged
him
to
the
crime
no
trace
was
left
in
his
bosom
the
wealth
of
india
would
not
have
tempted
him
to
a
second
enjoyment
of
her
person
his
nature
seemed
to
revolt
at
the
very
idea
and
fain
would
he
have
wiped
from
his
memory
the
scene
which
had
just
past
as
his
gloomy
rage
abated
in
proportion
did
his
compassion
augment
for
antonia
he
stopped
and
would
have
spoken
to
her
words
of
comfort
but
he
knew
not
from
whence
to
draw
them
and
remained
gazing
upon
her
with
mournful
wildness
her
situation
seemed
so
hopeless
so
woebegone
as
to
baffle
mortal
power
to
relieve
her
what
could
he
do
for
her
her
peace
of
mind
was
lost
her
honour
irreparably
ruined
she
was
cut
off
for
ever
from
society
nor
dared
he
give
her
back
to
it
he
was
conscious
that
were
she
to
appear
in
the
world
again
his
guilt
would
be
revealed
and
his
punishment
inevitable
to
one
so
laden
with
crimes
death
came
armed
with
double
terrors
yet
should
he
restore
antonia
to
light
and
stand
the
chance
of
her
betraying
him
how
miserable
a
prospect
would
present
itself
before
her
she
could
never
hope
to
be
creditably
established
she
would
be
marked
with
infamy
and
condemned
to
sorrow
and
solitude
for
the
remainder
of
her
existence
what
was
the
alternative
a
resolution
far
more
terrible
for
antonia
but
which
at
least
would
insure
the
abbot's
safety
he
determined
to
leave
the
world
persuaded
of
her
death
and
to
retain
her
a
captive
in
this
gloomy
prison
there
he
proposed
to
visit
her
every
night
to
bring
her
food
to
profess
his
penitence
and
mingle
his
tears
with
hers
the
monk
felt
that
this
resolution
was
unjust
and
cruel
but
it
was
his
only
means
to
prevent
antonia
from
publishing
his
guilt
and
her
own
infamy
should
he
release
her
he
could
not
depend
upon
her
silence
his
offence
was
too
flagrant
to
permit
his
hoping
for
her
forgiveness
besides
her
reappearing
would
excite
universal
curiosity
and
the
violence
of
her
affliction
would
prevent
her
from
concealing
its
cause
he
determined
therefore
that
antonia
should
remain
a
prisoner
in
the
dungeon
he
approached
her
with
confusion
painted
on
his
countenance
he
raised
her
from
the
ground
her
hand
trembled
as
he
took
it
and
he
dropped
it
again
as
if
he
had
touched
a
serpent
nature
seemed
to
recoil
at
the
touch
he
felt
himself
at
once
repulsed
from
and
attracted
towards
her
yet
could
account
for
neither
sentiment
there
was
something
in
her
look
which
penetrated
him
with
horror
and
though
his
understanding
was
still
ignorant
of
it
conscience
pointed
out
to
him
the
whole
extent
of
his
crime
in
hurried
accents
yet
the
gentlest
he
could
find
while
his
eye
was
averted
and
his
voice
scarcely
audible
he
strove
to
console
her
under
a
misfortune
which
now
could
not
be
avoided
he
declared
himself
sincerely
penitent
and
that
he
would
gladly
shed
a
drop
of
his
blood
for
every
tear
which
his
barbarity
had
forced
from
her
wretched
and
hopeless
antonia
listened
to
him
in
silent
grief
but
when
he
announced
her
confinement
in
the
sepulchre
that
dreadful
doom
to
which
even
death
seemed
preferable
roused
her
from
her
insensibility
at
once
to
linger
out
a
life
of
misery
in
a
narrow
loathsome
cell
known
to
exist
by
no
human
being
save
her
ravisher
surrounded
by
mouldering
corses
breathing
the
pestilential
air
of
corruption
never
more
to
behold
the
light
or
drink
the
pure
gale
of
heaven
the
idea
was
more
terrible
than
she
could
support
it
conquered
even
her
abhorrence
of
the
friar
again
she
sank
upon
her
knees
she
besought
his
compassion
in
terms
the
most
pathetic
and
urgent
she
promised
would
he
but
restore
her
to
liberty
to
conceal
her
injuries
from
the
world
to
assign
any
reason
for
her
reappearance
which
he
might
judge
proper
and
in
order
to
prevent
the
least
suspicion
from
falling
upon
him
she
offered
to
quit
madrid
immediately
her
entreaties
were
so
urgent
as
to
make
a
considerable
impression
upon
the
monk
he
reflected
that
as
her
person
no
longer
excited
his
desires
he
had
no
interest
in
keeping
her
concealed
as
he
had
at
first
intended
that
he
was
adding
a
fresh
injury
to
those
which
she
had
already
suffered
and
that
if
she
adhered
to
her
promises
whether
she
was
confined
or
at
liberty
his
life
and
reputation
were
equally
secure
on
the
other
hand
he
trembled
lest
in
her
affliction
antonia
should
unintentionally
break
her
engagement
or
that
her
excessive
simplicity
and
ignorance
of
deceit
should
permit
some
one
more
artful
to
surprize
her
secret
however
well-founded
were
these
apprehensions
compassion
and
a
sincere
wish
to
repair
his
fault
as
much
as
possible
solicited
his
complying
with
the
prayers
of
his
suppliant
the
difficulty
of
colouring
antonia's
unexpected
return
to
life
after
her
supposed
death
and
public
interment
was
the
only
point
which
kept
him
irresolute
he
was
still
pondering
on
the
means
of
removing
this
obstacle
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
feet
approaching
with
precipitation
the
door
of
the
vault
was
thrown
open
and
matilda
rushed
in
evidently
much
confused
and
terrified
on
seeing
a
stranger
enter
antonia
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
but
her
hopes
of
receiving
succour
from
him
were
soon
dissipated
the
supposed
novice
without
expressing
the
least
surprize
at
finding
a
woman
alone
with
the
monk
in
so
strange
a
place
and
at
so
late
an
hour
addressed
him
thus
without
losing
a
moment
'what
is
to
be
done
ambrosio
we
are
lost
unless
some
speedy
means
is
found
of
dispelling
the
rioters
ambrosio
the
convent
of
st
clare
is
on
fire
the
prioress
has
fallen
a
victim
to
the
fury
of
the
mob
already
is
the
abbey
menaced
with
a
similar
fate
alarmed
at
the
threats
of
the
people
the
monks
seek
for
you
everywhere
they
imagine
that
your
authority
alone
will
suffice
to
calm
this
disturbance
no
one
knows
what
is
become
of
you
and
your
absence
creates
universal
astonishment
and
despair
i
profited
by
the
confusion
and
fled
hither
to
warn
you
of
the
danger'
'this
will
soon
be
remedied'
answered
the
abbot
'i
will
hasten
back
to
my
cell
a
trivial
reason
will
account
for
my
having
been
missed'
'impossible'
rejoined
matilda
'the
sepulchre
is
filled
with
archers
lorenzo
de
medina
with
several
officers
of
the
inquisition
searches
through
the
vaults
and
pervades
every
passage
you
will
be
intercepted
in
your
flight
your
reasons
for
being
at
this
late
hour
in
the
sepulchre
will
be
examined
antonia
will
be
found
and
then
you
are
undone
for
ever'
'lorenzo
de
medina
officers
of
the
inquisition
what
brings
them
here
seek
they
for
me
am
i
then
suspected
oh
speak
matilda
answer
me
in
pity'
'as
yet
they
do
not
think
of
you
but
i
fear
that
they
will
ere
long
your
only
chance
of
escaping
their
notice
rests
upon
the
difficulty
of
exploring
this
vault
the
door
is
artfully
hidden
haply
it
may
not
be
observed
and
we
may
remain
concealed
till
the
search
is
over'
'but
antonia

should
the
inquisitors
draw
near
and
her
cries
be
heard
'
'thus
i
remove
that
danger'
interrupted
matilda
at
the
same
time
drawing
a
poignard
she
rushed
upon
her
devoted
prey
'hold
hold'
cried
ambrosio
seizing
her
hand
and
wresting
from
it
the
already
lifted
weapon
'what
would
you
do
cruel
woman
the
unfortunate
has
already
suffered
but
too
much
thanks
to
your
pernicious
consels
would
to
god
that
i
had
never
followed
them
would
to
god
that
i
had
never
seen
your
face'
matilda
darted
upon
him
a
look
of
scorn
'absurd'
she
exclaimed
with
an
air
of
passion
and
majesty
which
impressed
the
monk
with
awe
'after
robbing
her
of
all
that
made
it
dear
can
you
fear
to
deprive
her
of
a
life
so
miserable
but
'tis
well
let
her
live
to
convince
you
of
your
folly
i
abandon
you
to
your
evil
destiny
i
disclaim
your
alliance
who
trembles
to
commit
so
insignificant
a
crime
deserves
not
my
protection
hark
hark
ambrosio
hear
you
not
the
archers
they
come
and
your
destruction
is
inevitable'
at
this
moment
the
abbot
heard
the
sound
of
distant
voices
he
flew
to
close
the
door
on
whose
concealment
his
safety
depended
and
which
matilda
had
neglected
to
fasten
ere
he
could
reach
it
he
saw
antonia
glide
suddenly
by
him
rush
through
the
door
and
fly
towards
the
noise
with
the
swiftness
of
an
arrow
she
had
listened
attentively
to
matilda
she
heard
lorenzo's
name
mentioned
and
resolved
to
risque
every
thing
to
throw
herself
under
his
protection
the
door
was
open
the
sounds
convinced
her
that
the
archers
could
be
at
no
great
distance
she
mustered
up
her
little
remaining
strength
rushed
by
the
monk
ere
he
perceived
her
design
and
bent
her
course
rapidly
towards
the
voices
as
soon
as
he
recovered
from
his
first
surprize
the
abbot
failed
not
to
pursue
her
in
vain
did
antonia
redouble
her
speed
and
stretch
every
nerve
to
the
utmost
her
enemy
gained
upon
her
every
moment
she
heard
his
steps
close
after
her
and
felt
the
heat
of
his
breath
glow
upon
her
neck
he
overtook
her
he
twisted
his
hand
in
the
ringlets
of
her
streaming
hair
and
attempted
to
drag
her
back
with
him
to
the
dungeon
antonia
resisted
with
all
her
strength
she
folded
her
arms
round
a
pillar
which
supported
the
roof
and
shrieked
loudly
for
assistance
in
vain
did
the
monk
strive
to
threaten
her
to
silence
'help'
she
continued
to
exclaim
'help
help
for
god's
sake'
quickened
by
her
cries
the
sound
of
footsteps
was
heard
approaching
the
abbot
expected
every
moment
to
see
the
inquisitors
arrive
antonia
still
resisted
and
he
now
enforced
her
silence
by
means
the
most
horrible
and
inhuman
he
still
grasped
matilda's
dagger
without
allowing
himself
a
moment's
reflection
he
raised
it
and
plunged
it
twice
in
the
bosom
of
antonia
she
shrieked
and
sank
upon
the
ground
the
monk
endeavoured
to
bear
her
away
with
him
but
she
still
embraced
the
pillar
firmly
at
that
instant
the
light
of
approaching
torches
flashed
upon
the
walls
dreading
a
discovery
ambrosio
was
compelled
to
abandon
his
victim
and
hastily
fled
back
to
the
vault
where
he
had
left
matilda
he
fled
not
unobserved
don
ramirez
happening
to
arrive
the
first
perceived
a
female
bleeding
upon
the
ground
and
a
man
flying
from
the
spot
whose
confusion
betrayed
him
for
the
murderer
he
instantly
pursued
the
fugitive
with
some
part
of
the
archers
while
the
others
remained
with
lorenzo
to
protect
the
wounded
stranger
they
raised
her
and
supported
her
in
their
arms
she
had
fainted
from
excess
of
pain
but
soon
gave
signs
of
returning
life
she
opened
her
eyes
and
on
lifting
up
her
head
the
quantity
of
fair
hair
fell
back
which
till
then
had
obscured
her
features
'god
almighty
it
is
antonia'
such
was
lorenzo's
exclamation
while
he
snatched
her
from
the
attendant's
arms
and
clasped
her
in
his
own
though
aimed
by
an
uncertain
hand
the
poignard
had
answered
but
too
well
the
purpose
of
its
employer
the
wounds
were
mortal
and
antonia
was
conscious
that
she
never
could
recover
yet
the
few
moments
which
remained
for
her
were
moments
of
happiness
the
concern
exprest
upon
lorenzo's
countenance
the
frantic
fondness
of
his
complaints
and
his
earnest
enquiries
respecting
her
wounds
convinced
her
beyond
a
doubt
that
his
affections
were
her
own
she
would
not
be
removed
from
the
vaults
fearing
lest
motion
should
only
hasten
her
death
and
she
was
unwilling
to
lose
those
moments
which
she
past
in
receiving
proofs
of
lorenzo's
love
and
assuring
him
of
her
own
she
told
him
that
had
she
still
been
undefiled
she
might
have
lamented
the
loss
of
life
but
that
deprived
of
honour
and
branded
with
shame
death
was
to
her
a
blessing
she
could
not
have
been
his
wife
and
that
hope
being
denied
her
she
resigned
herself
to
the
grave
without
one
sigh
of
regret
she
bad
him
take
courage
conjured
him
not
to
abandon
himself
to
fruitless
sorrow
and
declared
that
she
mourned
to
leave
nothing
in
the
whole
world
but
him
while
every
sweet
accent
increased
rather
than
lightened
lorenzo's
grief
she
continued
to
converse
with
him
till
the
moment
of
dissolution
her
voice
grew
faint
and
scarcely
audible
a
thick
cloud
spread
itself
over
her
eyes
her
heart
beat
slow
and
irregular
and
every
instant
seemed
to
announce
that
her
fate
was
near
at
hand
she
lay
her
head
reclining
upon
lorenzo's
bosom
and
her
lips
still
murmuring
to
him
words
of
comfort
she
was
interrupted
by
the
convent
bell
as
tolling
at
a
distance
it
struck
the
hour
suddenly
antonia's
eyes
sparkled
with
celestial
brightness
her
frame
seemed
to
have
received
new
strength
and
animation
she
started
from
her
lover's
arms
'three
o'clock'
she
cried
'mother
i
come'
she
clasped
her
hands
and
sank
lifeless
upon
the
ground
lorenzo
in
agony
threw
himself
beside
her
he
tore
his
hair
beat
his
breast
and
refused
to
be
separated
from
the
corse
at
length
his
force
being
exhausted
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
from
the
vault
and
was
conveyed
to
the
palace
de
medina
scarcely
more
alive
than
the
unfortunate
antonia
in
the
meanwhile
though
closely
pursued
ambrosio
succeeded
in
regaining
the
vault
the
door
was
already
fastened
when
don
ramirez
arrived
and
much
time
elapsed
ere
the
fugitive's
retreat
was
discovered
but
nothing
can
resist
perseverance
though
so
artfully
concealed
the
door
could
not
escape
the
vigilance
of
the
archers
they
forced
it
open
and
entered
the
vault
to
the
infinite
dismay
of
ambrosio
and
his
companion
the
monk's
confusion
his
attempt
to
hide
himself
his
rapid
flight
and
the
blood
sprinkled
upon
his
cloaths
left
no
room
to
doubt
his
being
antonia's
murderer
but
when
he
was
recognized
for
the
immaculate
ambrosio
'the
man
of
holiness'
the
idol
of
madrid
the
faculties
of
the
spectators
were
chained
up
in
surprize
and
scarcely
could
they
persuade
themselves
that
what
they
saw
was
no
vision
the
abbot
strove
not
to
vindicate
himself
but
preserved
a
sullen
silence
he
was
secured
and
bound
the
same
precaution
was
taken
with
matilda
her
cowl
being
removed
the
delicacy
of
her
features
and
profusion
of
her
golden
hair
betrayed
her
sex
and
this
incident
created
fresh
amazement
the
dagger
was
also
found
in
the
tomb
where
the
monk
had
thrown
it
and
the
dungeon
having
undergone
a
thorough
search
the
two
culprits
were
conveyed
to
the
prisons
of
the
inquisition
don
ramirez
took
care
that
the
populace
should
remain
ignorant
both
of
the
crimes
and
profession
of
the
captives
he
feared
a
repetition
of
the
riots
which
had
followed
the
apprehending
the
prioress
of
st
clare
he
contented
himself
with
stating
to
the
capuchins
the
guilt
of
their
superior
to
avoid
the
shame
of
a
public
accusation
and
dreading
the
popular
fury
from
which
they
had
already
saved
their
abbey
with
much
difficulty
the
monks
readily
permitted
the
inquisitors
to
search
their
mansion
without
noise
no
fresh
discoveries
were
made
the
effects
found
in
the
abbot's
and
matilda's
cells
were
seized
and
carried
to
the
inquisition
to
be
produced
in
evidence
every
thing
else
remained
in
its
former
position
and
order
and
tranquillity
once
more
prevailed
through
madrid
st
clare's
convent
was
completely
ruined
by
the
united
ravages
of
the
mob
and
conflagration
nothing
remained
of
it
but
the
principal
walls
whose
thickness
and
solidity
had
preserved
them
from
the
flames
the
nuns
who
had
belonged
to
it
were
obliged
in
consequence
to
disperse
themselves
into
other
societies
but
the
prejudice
against
them
ran
high
and
the
superiors
were
very
unwilling
to
admit
them
however
most
of
them
being
related
to
families
the
most
distinguished
for
their
riches
birth
and
power
the
several
convents
were
compelled
to
receive
them
though
they
did
it
with
a
very
ill
grace
this
prejudice
was
extremely
false
and
unjustifiable
after
a
close
investigation
it
was
proved
that
all
in
the
convent
were
persuaded
of
the
death
of
agnes
except
the
four
nuns
whom
st
ursula
had
pointed
out
these
had
fallen
victims
to
the
popular
fury
as
had
also
several
who
were
perfectly
innocent
and
unconscious
of
the
whole
affair
blinded
by
resentment
the
mob
had
sacrificed
every
nun
who
fell
into
their
hands
they
who
escaped
were
entirely
indebted
to
the
duke
de
medina's
prudence
and
moderation
of
this
they
were
conscious
and
felt
for
that
nobleman
a
proper
sense
of
gratitude
virginia
was
not
the
most
sparing
of
her
thanks
she
wished
equally
to
make
a
proper
return
for
his
attentions
and
to
obtain
the
good
graces
of
lorenzo's
uncle
in
this
she
easily
succeeded
the
duke
beheld
her
beauty
with
wonder
and
admiration
and
while
his
eyes
were
enchanted
with
her
form
the
sweetness
of
her
manners
and
her
tender
concern
for
the
suffering
nun
prepossessed
his
heart
in
her
favour
this
virginia
had
discernment
enough
to
perceive
and
she
redoubled
her
attention
to
the
invalid
when
he
parted
from
her
at
the
door
of
her
father's
palace
the
duke
entreated
permission
to
enquire
occasionally
after
her
health
his
request
was
readily
granted
virginia
assured
him
that
the
marquis
de
villa-franca
would
be
proud
of
an
opportunity
to
thank
him
in
person
for
the
protection
afforded
to
her
they
now
separated
he
enchanted
with
her
beauty
and
gentleness
and
she
much
pleased
with
him
and
more
with
his
nephew
on
entering
the
palace
virginia's
first
care
was
to
summon
the
family
physician
and
take
care
of
her
unknown
charge
her
mother
hastened
to
share
with
her
the
charitable
office
alarmed
by
the
riots
and
trembling
for
his
daughter's
safety
who
was
his
only
child
the
marquis
had
flown
to
st
clare's
convent
and
was
still
employed
in
seeking
her
messengers
were
now
dispatched
on
all
sides
to
inform
him
that
he
would
find
her
safe
at
his
hotel
and
desire
him
to
hasten
thither
immediately
his
absence
gave
virginia
liberty
to
bestow
her
whole
attention
upon
her
patient
and
though
much
disordered
herself
by
the
adventures
of
the
night
no
persuasion
could
induce
her
to
quit
the
bedside
of
the
sufferer
her
constitution
being
much
enfeebled
by
want
and
sorrow
it
was
some
time
before
the
stranger
was
restored
to
her
senses
she
found
great
difficulty
in
swallowing
the
medicines
prescribed
to
her
but
this
obstacle
being
removed
she
easily
conquered
her
disease
which
proceeded
from
nothing
but
weakness
the
attention
which
was
paid
her
the
wholesome
food
to
which
she
had
been
long
a
stranger
and
her
joy
at
being
restored
to
liberty
to
society
and
as
she
dared
to
hope
to
love
all
this
combined
to
her
speedy
re-establishment
from
the
first
moment
of
knowing
her
her
melancholy
situation
her
sufferings
almost
unparalleled
had
engaged
the
affections
of
her
amiable
hostess
virginia
felt
for
her
the
most
lively
interest
but
how
was
she
delighted
when
her
guest
being
sufficiently
recovered
to
relate
her
history
she
recognized
in
the
captive
nun
the
sister
of
lorenzo
this
victim
of
monastic
cruelty
was
indeed
no
other
than
the
unfortunate
agnes
during
her
abode
in
the
convent
she
had
been
well
known
to
virginia
but
her
emaciated
form
her
features
altered
by
affliction
her
death
universally
credited
and
her
overgrown
and
matted
hair
which
hung
over
her
face
and
bosom
in
disorder
at
first
had
prevented
her
being
recollected
the
prioress
had
put
every
artifice
in
practice
to
induce
virginia
to
take
the
veil
for
the
heiress
of
villa-franca
would
have
been
no
despicable
acquisition
her
seeming
kindness
and
unremitted
attention
so
far
succeeded
that
her
young
relation
began
to
think
seriously
upon
compliance
better
instructed
in
the
disgust
and
ennui
of
a
monastic
life
agnes
had
penetrated
the
designs
of
the
domina
she
trembled
for
the
innocent
girl
and
endeavoured
to
make
her
sensible
of
her
error
she
painted
in
their
true
colours
the
numerous
inconveniencies
attached
to
a
convent
the
continued
restraint
the
low
jealousies
the
petty
intrigues
the
servile
court
and
gross
flattery
expected
by
the
superior
she
then
bad
virginia
reflect
on
the
brilliant
prospect
which
presented
itself
before
her
the
idol
of
her
parents
the
admiration
of
madrid
endowed
by
nature
and
education
with
every
perfection
of
person
and
mind
she
might
look
forward
to
an
establishment
the
most
fortunate
her
riches
furnished
her
with
the
means
of
exercising
in
their
fullest
extent
charity
and
benevolence
those
virtues
so
dear
to
her
and
her
stay
in
the
world
would
enable
her
discovering
objects
worthy
her
protection
which
could
not
be
done
in
the
seclusion
of
a
convent
her
persuasions
induced
virginia
to
lay
aside
all
thoughts
of
the
veil
but
another
argument
not
used
by
agnes
had
more
weight
with
her
than
all
the
others
put
together
she
had
seen
lorenzo
when
he
visited
his
sister
at
the
grate
his
person
pleased
her
and
her
conversations
with
agnes
generally
used
to
terminate
in
some
question
about
her
brother
she
who
doted
upon
lorenzo
wished
for
no
better
than
an
opportunity
to
trumpet
out
his
praise
she
spoke
of
him
in
terms
of
rapture
and
to
convince
her
auditor
how
just
were
his
sentiments
how
cultivated
his
mind
and
elegant
his
expressions
she
showed
her
at
different
times
the
letters
which
she
received
from
him
she
soon
perceived
that
from
these
communications
the
heart
of
her
young
friend
had
imbibed
impressions
which
she
was
far
from
intending
to
give
but
was
truly
happy
to
discover
she
could
not
have
wished
her
brother
a
more
desirable
union
heiress
of
villa-franca
virtuous
affectionate
beautiful
and
accomplished
virginia
seemed
calculated
to
make
him
happy
she
sounded
her
brother
upon
the
subject
though
without
mentioning
names
or
circumstances
he
assured
her
in
his
answers
that
his
heart
and
hand
were
totally
disengaged
and
she
thought
that
upon
these
grounds
she
might
proceed
without
danger
she
in
consequence
endeavoured
to
strengthen
the
dawning
passion
of
her
friend
lorenzo
was
made
the
constant
topic
of
her
discourse
and
the
avidity
with
which
her
auditor
listened
the
sighs
which
frequently
escaped
from
her
bosom
and
the
eagerness
with
which
upon
any
digression
she
brought
back
the
conversation
to
the
subject
whence
it
had
wandered
sufficed
to
convince
agnes
that
her
brother's
addresses
would
be
far
from
disagreeable
she
at
length
ventured
to
mention
her
wishes
to
the
duke
though
a
stranger
to
the
lady
herself
he
knew
enough
of
her
situation
to
think
her
worthy
his
nephew's
hand
it
was
agreed
between
him
and
his
niece
that
she
should
insinuate
the
idea
to
lorenzo
and
she
only
waited
his
return
to
madrid
to
propose
her
friend
to
him
as
his
bride
the
unfortunate
events
which
took
place
in
the
interim
prevented
her
from
executing
her
design
virginia
wept
her
loss
sincerely
both
as
a
companion
and
as
the
only
person
to
whom
she
could
speak
of
lorenzo
her
passion
continued
to
prey
upon
her
heart
in
secret
and
she
had
almost
determined
to
confess
her
sentiments
to
her
mother
when
accident
once
more
threw
their
object
in
her
way
the
sight
of
him
so
near
her
his
politeness
his
compassion
his
intrepidity
had
combined
to
give
new
ardour
to
her
affection
when
she
now
found
her
friend
and
advocate
restored
to
her
she
looked
upon
her
as
a
gift
from
heaven
she
ventured
to
cherish
the
hope
of
being
united
to
lorenzo
and
resolved
to
use
with
him
his
sister's
influence
supposing
that
before
her
death
agnes
might
possibly
have
made
the
proposal
the
duke
had
placed
all
his
nephew's
hints
of
marriage
to
virginia's
account
consequently
he
gave
them
the
most
favourable
reception
on
returning
to
his
hotel
the
relation
given
him
of
antonia's
death
and
lorenzo's
behaviour
on
the
occasion
made
evident
his
mistake
he
lamented
the
circumstances
but
the
unhappy
girl
being
effectually
out
of
the
way
he
trusted
that
his
designs
would
yet
be
executed
'tis
true
that
lorenzo's
situation
just
then
ill-suited
him
for
a
bridegroom
his
hopes
disappointed
at
the
moment
when
he
expected
to
realize
them
and
the
dreadful
and
sudden
death
of
his
mistress
had
affected
him
very
severely
the
duke
found
him
upon
the
bed
of
sickness
his
attendants
expressed
serious
apprehensions
for
his
life
but
the
uncle
entertained
not
the
same
fears
he
was
of
opinion
and
not
unwisely
that
'men
have
died
and
worms
have
eat
them
but
not
for
love'
he
therefore
flattered
himself
that
however
deep
might
be
the
impression
made
upon
his
nephew's
heart
time
and
virginia
would
be
able
to
efface
it
he
now
hastened
to
the
afflicted
youth
and
endeavoured
to
console
him
he
sympathised
in
his
distress
but
encouraged
him
to
resist
the
encroachments
of
despair
he
allowed
that
he
could
not
but
feel
shocked
at
an
event
so
terrible
nor
could
he
blame
his
sensibility
but
he
besought
him
not
to
torment
himself
with
vain
regrets
and
rather
to
struggle
with
affliction
and
preserve
his
life
if
not
for
his
own
sake
at
least
for
the
sake
of
those
who
were
fondly
attached
to
him
while
he
laboured
thus
to
make
lorenzo
forget
antonia's
loss
the
duke
paid
his
court
assiduously
to
virginia
and
seized
every
opportunity
to
advance
his
nephew's
interest
in
her
heart
it
may
easily
be
expected
that
agnes
was
not
long
without
enquiring
after
don
raymond
she
was
shocked
to
hear
the
wretched
situation
to
which
grief
had
reduced
him
yet
she
could
not
help
exulting
secretly
when
she
reflected
that
his
illness
proved
the
sincerity
of
his
love
the
duke
undertook
the
office
himself
of
announcing
to
the
invalid
the
happiness
which
awaited
him
though
he
omitted
no
precaution
to
prepare
him
for
such
an
event
at
this
sudden
change
from
despair
to
happiness
raymond's
transports
were
so
violent
as
nearly
to
have
proved
fatal
to
him
these
once
passed
the
tranquillity
of
his
mind
the
assurance
of
felicity
and
above
all
the
presence
of
agnes
who
was
no
sooner
reestablished
by
the
care
of
virginia
and
the
marchioness
than
she
hastened
to
attend
her
lover
soon
enabled
him
to
overcome
the
effects
of
his
late
dreadful
malady
the
calm
of
his
soul
communicated
itself
to
his
body
and
he
recovered
with
such
rapidity
as
to
create
universal
surprize
no
so
lorenzo
antonia's
death
accompanied
with
such
terrible
circumstances
weighed
upon
his
mind
heavily
he
was
worn
down
to
a
shadow
nothing
could
give
him
pleasure
he
was
persuaded
with
difficulty
to
swallow
nourishment
sufficient
for
the
support
of
life
and
a
consumption
was
apprehended
the
society
of
agnes
formed
his
only
comfort
though
accident
had
never
permitted
their
being
much
together
he
entertained
for
her
a
sincere
friendship
and
attachment
perceiving
how
necessary
she
was
to
him
she
seldom
quitted
his
chamber
she
listened
to
his
complaints
with
unwearied
attention
and
soothed
him
by
the
gentleness
of
her
manners
and
by
sympathising
with
his
distress
she
still
inhabited
the
palace
de
villa-franca
the
possessors
of
which
treated
her
with
marked
affection
the
duke
had
intimated
to
the
marquis
his
wishes
respecting
virginia
the
match
was
unexceptionable
lorenzo
was
heir
to
his
uncle's
immense
property
and
was
distinguished
in
madrid
for
his
agreeable
person
extensive
knowledge
and
propriety
of
conduct
add
to
this
that
the
marchioness
had
discovered
how
strong
was
her
daughter's
prepossession
in
his
favour
in
consequence
the
duke's
proposal
was
accepted
without
hesitation
every
precaution
was
taken
to
induce
lorenzo's
seeing
the
lady
with
those
sentiments
which
she
so
well
merited
to
excite
in
her
visits
to
her
brother
agnes
was
frequently
accompanied
by
the
marchioness
and
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
move
into
his
antichamber
virginia
under
her
mother's
protection
was
sometimes
permitted
to
express
her
wishes
for
his
recovery
this
she
did
with
such
delicacy
the
manner
in
which
she
mentioned
antonia
was
so
tender
and
soothing
and
when
she
lamented
her
rival's
melancholy
fate
her
bright
eyes
shone
so
beautiful
through
her
tears
that
lorenzo
could
not
behold
or
listen
to
her
without
emotion
his
relations
as
well
as
the
lady
perceived
that
with
every
day
her
society
seemed
to
give
him
fresh
pleasure
and
that
he
spoke
of
her
in
terms
of
stronger
admiration
however
they
prudently
kept
their
observations
to
themselves
no
word
was
dropped
which
might
lead
him
to
suspect
their
designs
they
continued
their
former
conduct
and
attention
and
left
time
to
ripen
into
a
warmer
sentiment
the
friendship
which
he
already
felt
for
virginia
in
the
mean
while
her
visits
became
more
frequent
and
latterly
there
was
scarce
a
day
of
which
she
did
not
pass
some
part
by
the
side
of
lorenzo's
couch
he
gradually
regained
his
strength
but
the
progress
of
his
recovery
was
slow
and
doubtful
one
evening
he
seemed
to
be
in
better
spirits
than
usual
agnes
and
her
lover
the
duke
virginia
and
her
parents
were
sitting
round
him
he
now
for
the
first
time
entreated
his
sister
to
inform
him
how
she
had
escaped
the
effects
of
the
poison
which
st
ursula
had
seen
her
swallow
fearful
of
recalling
those
scenes
to
his
mind
in
which
antonia
had
perished
she
had
hitherto
concealed
from
him
the
history
of
her
sufferings
as
he
now
started
the
subject
himself
and
thinking
that
perhaps
the
narrative
of
her
sorrows
might
draw
him
from
the
contemplation
of
those
on
which
he
dwelt
too
constantly
she
immediately
complied
with
his
request
the
rest
of
the
company
had
already
heard
her
story
but
the
interest
which
all
present
felt
for
its
heroine
made
them
anxious
to
hear
it
repeated
the
whole
society
seconding
lorenzo's
entreaties
agnes
obeyed
she
first
recounted
the
discovery
which
had
taken
place
in
the
abbey
chapel
the
domina's
resentment
and
the
midnight
scene
of
which
st
ursula
had
been
a
concealed
witness
though
the
nun
had
already
described
this
latter
event
agnes
now
related
it
more
circumstantially
and
at
large
after
which
she
proceeded
in
her
narrative
as
follows
conclusion
of
the
history
of
agnes
de
medina
my
supposed
death
was
attended
with
the
greatest
agonies
those
moments
which
i
believed
my
last
were
embittered
by
the
domina's
assurances
that
i
could
not
escape
perdition
and
as
my
eyes
closed
i
heard
her
rage
exhale
itself
in
curses
on
my
offence
the
horror
of
this
situation
of
a
death-bed
from
which
hope
was
banished
of
a
sleep
from
which
i
was
only
to
wake
to
find
myself
the
prey
of
flames
and
furies
was
more
dreadful
than
i
can
describe
when
animation
revived
in
me
my
soul
was
still
impressed
with
these
terrible
ideas
i
looked
round
with
fear
expecting
to
behold
the
ministers
of
divine
vengeance
for
the
first
hour
my
senses
were
so
bewildered
and
my
brain
so
dizzy
that
i
strove
in
vain
to
arrange
the
strange
images
which
floated
in
wild
confusion
before
me
if
i
endeavoured
to
raise
myself
from
the
ground
the
wandering
of
my
head
deceived
me
every
thing
around
me
seemed
to
rock
and
i
sank
once
more
upon
the
earth
my
weak
and
dazzled
eyes
were
unable
to
bear
a
nearer
approach
to
a
gleam
of
light
which
i
saw
trembling
above
me
i
was
compelled
to
close
them
again
and
remain
motionless
in
the
same
posture
a
full
hour
elapsed
before
i
was
sufficiently
myself
to
examine
the
surrounding
objects
when
i
did
examine
them
what
terror
filled
my
bosom
i
found
myself
extended
upon
a
sort
of
wicker
couch
it
had
six
handles
to
it
which
doubtless
had
served
the
nuns
to
convey
me
to
my
grave
i
was
covered
with
a
linen
cloth
several
faded
flowers
were
strown
over
me
on
one
side
lay
a
small
wooden
crucifix
on
the
other
a
rosary
of
large
beads
four
low
narrow
walls
confined
me
the
top
was
also
covered
and
in
it
was
practised
a
small
grated
door
through
this
was
admitted
the
little
air
which
circulated
in
this
miserable
place
a
faint
glimmering
of
light
which
streamed
through
the
bars
permitted
me
to
distinguish
the
surrounding
horrors
i
was
opprest
by
a
noisome
suffocating
smell
and
perceiving
that
the
grated
door
was
unfastened
i
thought
that
i
might
possibly
effect
my
escape
as
i
raised
myself
with
this
design
my
hand
rested
upon
something
soft
i
grasped
it
and
advanced
it
towards
the
light
almighty
god
what
was
my
disgust
my
consternation
in
spite
of
its
putridity
and
the
worms
which
preyed
upon
it
i
perceived
a
corrupted
human
head
and
recognised
the
features
of
a
nun
who
had
died
some
months
before
i
threw
it
from
me
and
sank
almost
lifeless
upon
my
bier
when
my
strength
returned
this
circumstance
and
the
consciousness
of
being
surrounded
by
the
loathsome
and
mouldering
bodies
of
my
companions
increased
my
desire
to
escape
from
my
fearful
prison
i
again
moved
towards
the
light
the
grated
door
was
within
my
reach
i
lifted
it
without
difficulty
probably
it
had
been
left
unclosed
to
facilitate
my
quitting
the
dungeon
aiding
myself
by
the
irregularity
of
the
walls
some
of
whose
stones
projected
beyond
the
rest
i
contrived
to
ascend
them
and
drag
myself
out
of
my
prison
i
now
found
myself
in
a
vault
tolerably
spacious
several
tombs
similar
in
appearance
to
that
whence
i
had
just
escaped
were
ranged
along
the
sides
in
order
and
seemed
to
be
considerably
sunk
within
the
earth
a
sepulchral
lamp
was
suspended
from
the
roof
by
an
iron
chain
and
shed
a
gloomy
light
through
the
dungeon
emblems
of
death
were
seen
on
every
side
skulls
shoulder-blades
thigh-bones
and
other
leavings
of
mortality
were
scattered
upon
the
dewy
ground
each
tomb
was
ornamented
with
a
large
crucifix
and
in
one
corner
stood
a
wooden
statue
of
st
clare
to
these
objects
i
at
first
paid
no
attention
a
door
the
only
outlet
from
the
vault
had
attracted
my
eyes
i
hastened
towards
it
having
wrapped
my
winding-sheet
closely
round
me
i
pushed
against
the
door
and
to
my
inexpressible
terror
found
that
it
was
fastened
on
the
outside
i
guessed
immediately
that
the
prioress
mistaking
the
nature
of
the
liquor
which
she
had
compelled
me
to
drink
instead
of
poison
had
administered
a
strong
opiate
from
this
i
concluded
that
being
to
all
appearance
dead
i
had
received
the
rites
of
burial
and
that
deprived
of
the
power
of
making
my
existence
known
it
would
be
my
fate
to
expire
of
hunger
this
idea
penetrated
me
with
horror
not
merely
for
my
own
sake
but
that
of
the
innocent
creature
who
still
lived
within
my
bosom
i
again
endeavoured
to
open
the
door
but
it
resisted
all
my
efforts
i
stretched
my
voice
to
the
extent
of
its
compass
and
shrieked
for
aid
i
was
remote
from
the
hearing
of
every
one
no
friendly
voice
replied
to
mine
a
profound
and
melancholy
silence
prevailed
through
the
vault
and
i
despaired
of
liberty
my
long
abstinence
from
food
now
began
to
torment
me
the
tortures
which
hunger
inflicted
on
me
were
the
most
painful
and
insupportable
yet
they
seemed
to
increase
with
every
hour
which
past
over
my
head
sometimes
i
threw
myself
upon
the
ground
and
rolled
upon
it
wild
and
desperate
sometimes
starting
up
i
returned
to
the
door
again
strove
to
force
it
open
and
repeated
my
fruitless
cries
for
succour
often
was
i
on
the
point
of
striking
my
temple
against
the
sharp
corner
of
some
monument
dashing
out
my
brains
and
thus
terminating
my
woes
at
once
but
still
the
remembrance
of
my
baby
vanquished
my
resolution
i
trembled
at
a
deed
which
equally
endangered
my
child's
existence
and
my
own
then
would
i
vent
my
anguish
in
loud
exclamations
and
passionate
complaints
and
then
again
my
strength
failing
me
silent
and
hopeless
i
would
sit
me
down
upon
the
base
of
st
clare's
statue
fold
my
arms
and
abandon
myself
to
sullen
despair
thus
passed
several
wretched
hours
death
advanced
towards
me
with
rapid
strides
and
i
expected
that
every
succeeding
moment
would
be
that
of
my
dissolution
suddenly
a
neighbouring
tomb
caught
my
eye
a
basket
stood
upon
it
which
till
then
i
had
not
observed
i
started
from
my
seat
i
made
towards
it
as
swiftly
as
my
exhausted
frame
would
permit
how
eagerly
did
i
seize
the
basket
on
finding
it
to
contain
a
loaf
of
coarse
bread
and
a
small
bottle
of
water
i
threw
myself
with
avidity
upon
these
humble
aliments
they
had
to
all
appearance
been
placed
in
the
vault
for
several
days
the
bread
was
hard
and
the
water
tainted
yet
never
did
i
taste
food
to
me
so
delicious
when
the
cravings
of
appetite
were
satisfied
i
busied
myself
with
conjectures
upon
this
new
circumstance
i
debated
whether
the
basket
had
been
placed
there
with
a
view
to
my
necessity
hope
answered
my
doubts
in
the
affirmative
yet
who
could
guess
me
to
be
in
need
of
such
assistance
if
my
existence
was
known
why
was
i
detained
in
this
gloomy
vault
if
i
was
kept
a
prisoner
what
meant
the
ceremony
of
committing
me
to
the
tomb
or
if
i
was
doomed
to
perish
with
hunger
to
whose
pity
was
i
indebted
for
provisions
placed
within
my
reach
a
friend
would
not
have
kept
my
dreadful
punishment
a
secret
neither
did
it
seem
probable
that
an
enemy
would
have
taken
pains
to
supply
me
with
the
means
of
existence
upon
the
whole
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
domina's
designs
upon
my
life
had
been
discovered
by
some
one
of
my
partizans
in
the
convent
who
had
found
means
to
substitute
an
opiate
for
poison
that
she
had
furnished
me
with
food
to
support
me
till
she
could
effect
my
delivery
and
that
she
was
then
employed
in
giving
intelligence
to
my
relations
of
my
danger
and
pointing
out
a
way
to
release
me
from
captivity
yet
why
then
was
the
quality
of
my
provisions
so
coarse
how
could
my
friend
have
entered
the
vault
without
the
domina's
knowledge
and
if
she
had
entered
why
was
the
door
fastened
so
carefully
these
reflections
staggered
me
yet
still
this
idea
was
the
most
favourable
to
my
hopes
and
i
dwelt
upon
it
in
preference
my
meditations
were
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
distant
footsteps
they
approached
but
slowly
rays
of
light
now
darted
through
the
crevices
of
the
door
uncertain
whether
the
persons
who
advanced
came
to
relieve
me
or
were
conducted
by
some
other
motive
to
the
vault
i
failed
not
to
attract
their
notice
by
loud
cries
for
help
still
the
sounds
drew
near
the
light
grew
stronger
at
length
with
inexpressible
pleasure
i
heard
the
key
turning
in
the
lock
persuaded
that
my
deliverance
was
at
hand
i
flew
towards
the
door
with
a
shriek
of
joy
it
opened
but
all
my
hopes
of
escape
died
away
when
the
prioress
appeared
followed
by
the
same
four
nuns
who
had
been
witnesses
of
my
supposed
death
they
bore
torches
in
their
hands
and
gazed
upon
me
in
fearful
silence
i
started
back
in
terror
the
domina
descended
into
the
vault
as
did
also
her
companions
she
bent
upon
me
a
stern
resentful
eye
but
expressed
no
surprize
at
finding
me
still
living
she
took
the
seat
which
i
had
just
quitted
the
door
was
again
closed
and
the
nuns
ranged
themselves
behind
their
superior
while
the
glare
of
their
torches
dimmed
by
the
vapours
and
dampness
of
the
vault
gilded
with
cold
beams
the
surrounding
monuments
for
some
moments
all
preserved
a
dead
and
solemn
silence
i
stood
at
some
distance
from
the
prioress
at
length
she
beckoned
me
to
advance
trembling
at
the
severity
of
her
aspect
my
strength
scarce
sufficed
me
to
obey
her
i
drew
near
but
my
limbs
were
unable
to
support
their
burthen
i
sank
upon
my
knees
i
clasped
my
hands
and
lifted
them
up
to
her
for
mercy
but
had
no
power
to
articulate
a
syllable
she
gazed
upon
me
with
angry
eyes
'do
i
see
a
penitent
or
a
criminal'
she
said
at
length
'are
those
hands
raised
in
contrition
for
your
crimes
or
in
fear
of
meeting
their
punishment
do
those
tears
acknowledge
the
justice
of
your
doom
or
only
solicit
mitigation
of
your
sufferings
i
fear
me
'tis
the
latter'
she
paused
but
kept
her
eye
still
fixt
upon
mine
'take
courage'
she
continued
'i
wish
not
for
your
death
but
your
repentance
the
draught
which
i
administered
was
no
poison
but
an
opiate
my
intention
in
deceiving
you
was
to
make
you
feel
the
agonies
of
a
guilty
conscience
had
death
overtaken
you
suddenly
while
your
crimes
were
still
unrepented
you
have
suffered
those
agonies
i
have
brought
you
to
be
familiar
with
the
sharpness
of
death
and
i
trust
that
your
momentary
anguish
will
prove
to
you
an
eternal
benefit
it
is
not
my
design
to
destroy
your
immortal
soul
or
bid
you
seek
the
grave
burthened
with
the
weight
of
sins
unexpiated
no
daughter
far
from
it
i
will
purify
you
with
wholesome
chastisement
and
furnish
you
with
full
leisure
for
contrition
and
remorse
hear
then
my
sentence
the
ill-judged
zeal
of
your
friends
delayed
its
execution
but
cannot
now
prevent
it
all
madrid
believes
you
to
be
no
more
your
relations
are
thoroughly
persuaded
of
your
death
and
the
nuns
your
partizans
have
assisted
at
your
funeral
your
existence
can
never
be
suspected
i
have
taken
such
precautions
as
must
render
it
an
impenetrable
mystery
then
abandon
all
thoughts
of
a
world
from
which
you
are
eternally
separated
and
employ
the
few
hours
which
are
allowed
you
in
preparing
for
the
next'
this
exordium
led
me
to
expect
something
terrible
i
trembled
and
would
have
spoken
to
deprecate
her
wrath
but
a
motion
of
the
domina
commanded
me
to
be
silent
she
proceeded
'though
of
late
years
unjustly
neglected
and
now
opposed
by
many
of
our
misguided
sisters
whom
heaven
convert
it
is
my
intention
to
revive
the
laws
of
our
order
in
their
full
force
that
against
incontinence
is
severe
but
no
more
than
so
monstrous
an
offence
demands
submit
to
it
daughter
without
resistance
you
will
find
the
benefit
of
patience
and
resignation
in
a
better
life
than
this
listen
then
to
the
sentence
of
st
clare
beneath
these
vaults
there
exist
prisons
intended
to
receive
such
criminals
as
yourself
artfully
is
their
entrance
concealed
and
she
who
enters
them
must
resign
all
hopes
of
liberty
thither
must
you
now
be
conveyed
food
shall
be
supplied
you
but
not
sufficient
for
the
indulgence
of
appetite
you
shall
have
just
enough
to
keep
together
body
and
soul
and
its
quality
shall
be
the
simplest
and
coarsest
weep
daughter
weep
and
moisten
your
bread
with
your
tears
god
knows
that
you
have
ample
cause
for
sorrow
chained
down
in
one
of
these
secret
dungeons
shut
out
from
the
world
and
light
for
ever
with
no
comfort
but
religion
no
society
but
repentance
thus
must
you
groan
away
the
remainder
of
your
days
such
are
st
clare's
orders
submit
to
them
without
repining
follow
me'
thunderstruck
at
this
barbarous
decree
my
little
remaining
strength
abandoned
me
i
answered
only
by
falling
at
her
feet
and
bathing
them
with
tears
the
domina
unmoved
by
my
affliction
rose
from
her
seat
with
a
stately
air
she
repeated
her
commands
in
an
absolute
tone
but
my
excessive
faintness
made
me
unable
to
obey
her
mariana
and
alix
raised
me
from
the
ground
and
carried
me
forwards
in
their
arms
the
prioress
moved
on
leaning
upon
violante
and
camilla
preceded
her
with
a
torch
thus
passed
our
sad
procession
along
the
passages
in
silence
only
broken
by
my
sighs
and
groans
we
stopped
before
the
principal
shrine
of
st
clare
the
statue
was
removed
from
its
pedestal
though
how
i
knew
not
the
nuns
afterwards
raised
an
iron
grate
till
then
concealed
by
the
image
and
let
it
fall
on
the
other
side
with
a
loud
crash
the
awful
sound
repeated
by
the
vaults
above
and
caverns
below
me
rouzed
me
from
the
despondent
apathy
in
which
i
had
been
plunged
i
looked
before
me
an
abyss
presented
itself
to
my
affrighted
eyes
and
a
steep
and
narrow
staircase
whither
my
conductors
were
leading
me
i
shrieked
and
started
back
i
implored
compassion
rent
the
air
with
my
cries
and
summoned
both
heaven
and
earth
to
my
assistance
in
vain
i
was
hurried
down
the
staircase
and
forced
into
one
of
the
cells
which
lined
the
cavern's
sides
my
blood
ran
cold
as
i
gazed
upon
this
melancholy
abode
the
cold
vapours
hovering
in
the
air
the
walls
green
with
damp
the
bed
of
straw
so
forlorn
and
comfortless
the
chain
destined
to
bind
me
for
ever
to
my
prison
and
the
reptiles
of
every
description
which
as
the
torches
advanced
towards
them
i
descried
hurrying
to
their
retreats
struck
my
heart
with
terrors
almost
too
exquisite
for
nature
to
bear
driven
by
despair
to
madness
i
burst
suddenly
from
the
nuns
who
held
me
i
threw
myself
upon
my
knees
before
the
prioress
and
besought
her
mercy
in
the
most
passionate
and
frantic
terms
'if
not
on
me'
said
i
'look
at
least
with
pity
on
that
innocent
being
whose
life
is
attached
to
mine
great
is
my
crime
but
let
not
my
child
suffer
for
it
my
baby
has
committed
no
fault
oh
spare
me
for
the
sake
of
my
unborn
offspring
whom
ere
it
tastes
life
your
severity
dooms
to
destruction'
the
prioress
drew
back
haughtily
she
forced
her
habit
from
my
grasp
as
if
my
touch
had
been
contagious
'what'
she
exclaimed
with
an
exasperated
air
'what
dare
you
plead
for
the
produce
of
your
shame
shall
a
creature
be
permitted
to
live
conceived
in
guilt
so
monstrous
abandoned
woman
speak
for
him
no
more
better
that
the
wretch
should
perish
than
live
begotten
in
perjury
incontinence
and
pollution
it
cannot
fail
to
prove
a
prodigy
of
vice
hear
me
thou
guilty
expect
no
mercy
from
me
either
for
yourself
or
brat
rather
pray
that
death
may
seize
you
before
you
produce
it
or
if
it
must
see
the
light
that
its
eyes
may
immediately
be
closed
again
for
ever
no
aid
shall
be
given
you
in
your
labour
bring
your
offspring
into
the
world
yourself
feed
it
yourself
nurse
it
yourself
bury
it
yourself
god
grant
that
the
latter
may
happen
soon
lest
you
receive
comfort
from
the
fruit
of
your
iniquity'
this
inhuman
speech
the
threats
which
it
contained
the
dreadful
sufferings
foretold
to
me
by
the
domina
and
her
prayers
for
my
infant's
death
on
whom
though
unborn
i
already
doated
were
more
than
my
exhausted
frame
could
support
uttering
a
deep
groan
i
fell
senseless
at
the
feet
of
my
unrelenting
enemy
i
know
not
how
long
i
remained
in
this
situation
but
i
imagine
that
some
time
must
have
elapsed
before
my
recovery
since
it
sufficed
the
prioress
and
her
nuns
to
quit
the
cavern
when
my
senses
returned
i
found
myself
in
silence
and
solitude
i
heard
not
even
the
retiring
footsteps
of
my
persecutors
all
was
hushed
and
all
was
dreadful
i
had
been
thrown
upon
the
bed
of
straw
the
heavy
chain
which
i
had
already
eyed
with
terror
was
wound
around
my
waist
and
fastened
me
to
the
wall
a
lamp
glimmering
with
dull
melancholy
rays
through
my
dungeon
permitted
my
distinguishing
all
its
horrors
it
was
separated
from
the
cavern
by
a
low
and
irregular
wall
of
stone
a
large
chasm
was
left
open
in
it
which
formed
the
entrance
for
door
there
was
none
a
leaden
crucifix
was
in
front
of
my
straw
couch
a
tattered
rug
lay
near
me
as
did
also
a
chaplet
of
beads
and
not
far
from
me
stood
a
pitcher
of
water
and
a
wicker
basket
containing
a
small
loaf
and
a
bottle
of
oil
to
supply
my
lamp
with
a
despondent
eye
did
i
examine
this
scene
of
suffering
when
i
reflected
that
i
was
doomed
to
pass
in
it
the
remainder
of
my
days
my
heart
was
rent
with
bitter
anguish
i
had
once
been
taught
to
look
forward
to
a
lot
so
different
at
one
time
my
prospects
had
appeared
so
bright
so
flattering
now
all
was
lost
to
me
friends
comfort
society
happiness
in
one
moment
i
was
deprived
of
all
dead
to
the
world
dead
to
pleasure
i
lived
to
nothing
but
the
sense
of
misery
how
fair
did
that
world
seem
to
me
from
which
i
was
for
ever
excluded
how
many
loved
objects
did
it
contain
whom
i
never
should
behold
again
as
i
threw
a
look
of
terror
round
my
prison
as
i
shrunk
from
the
cutting
wind
which
howled
through
my
subterraneous
dwelling
the
change
seemed
so
striking
so
abrupt
that
i
doubted
its
reality
that
the
duke
de
medina's
niece
that
the
destined
bride
of
the
marquis
de
las
cisternas
one
bred
up
in
affluence
related
to
the
noblest
families
in
spain
and
rich
in
a
multitude
of
affectionate
friends
that
she
should
in
one
moment
become
a
captive
separated
from
the
world
for
ever
weighed
down
with
chains
and
reduced
to
support
life
with
the
coarsest
aliments
appeared
a
change
so
sudden
and
incredible
that
i
believed
myself
the
sport
of
some
frightful
vision
its
continuance
convinced
me
of
my
mistake
with
but
too
much
certainty
every
morning
my
hopes
were
disappointed
at
length
i
abandoned
all
idea
of
escaping
i
resigned
myself
to
my
fate
and
only
expected
liberty
when
she
came
the
companion
of
death
my
mental
anguish
and
the
dreadful
scenes
in
which
i
had
been
an
actress
advanced
the
period
of
my
labour
in
solitude
and
misery
abandoned
by
all
unassisted
by
art
uncomforted
by
friendship
with
pangs
which
if
witnessed
would
have
touched
the
hardest
heart
was
i
delivered
of
my
wretched
burthen
it
came
alive
into
the
world
but
i
knew
not
how
to
treat
it
or
by
what
means
to
preserve
its
existence
i
could
only
bathe
it
with
tears
warm
it
in
my
bosom
and
offer
up
prayers
for
its
safety
i
was
soon
deprived
of
this
mournful
employment
the
want
of
proper
attendance
my
ignorance
how
to
nurse
it
the
bitter
cold
of
the
dungeon
and
the
unwholesome
air
which
inflated
its
lungs
terminated
my
sweet
babe's
short
and
painful
existence
it
expired
in
a
few
hours
after
its
birth
and
i
witnessed
its
death
with
agonies
which
beggar
all
description
but
my
grief
was
unavailing
my
infant
was
no
more
nor
could
all
my
sighs
impart
to
its
little
tender
frame
the
breath
of
a
moment
i
rent
my
winding-sheet
and
wrapped
in
it
my
lovely
child
i
placed
it
on
my
bosom
its
soft
arm
folded
round
my
neck
and
its
pale
cold
cheek
resting
upon
mine
thus
did
its
lifeless
limbs
repose
while
i
covered
it
with
kisses
talked
to
it
wept
and
moaned
over
it
without
remission
day
or
night
camilla
entered
my
prison
regularly
once
every
twenty-four
hours
to
bring
me
food
in
spite
of
her
flinty
nature
she
could
not
behold
this
spectacle
unmoved
she
feared
that
grief
so
excessive
would
at
length
turn
my
brain
and
in
truth
i
was
not
always
in
my
proper
senses
from
a
principle
of
compassion
she
urged
me
to
permit
the
corse
to
be
buried
but
to
this
i
never
would
consent
i
vowed
not
to
part
with
it
while
i
had
life
its
presence
was
my
only
comfort
and
no
persuasion
could
induce
me
to
give
it
up
it
soon
became
a
mass
of
putridity
and
to
every
eye
was
a
loathsome
and
disgusting
object
to
every
eye
but
a
mother's
in
vain
did
human
feelings
bid
me
recoil
from
this
emblem
of
mortality
with
repugnance
i
withstood
and
vanquished
that
repugnance
i
persisted
in
holding
my
infant
to
my
bosom
in
lamenting
it
loving
it
adoring
it
hour
after
hour
have
i
passed
upon
my
sorry
couch
contemplating
what
had
once
been
my
child
i
endeavoured
to
retrace
its
features
through
the
livid
corruption
with
which
they
were
overspread
during
my
confinement
this
sad
occupation
was
my
only
delight
and
at
that
time
worlds
should
not
have
bribed
me
to
give
it
up
even
when
released
from
my
prison
i
brought
away
my
child
in
my
arms
the
representations
of
my
two
kind
friends--here
she
took
the
hands
of
the
marchioness
and
virginia
and
pressed
them
alternately
to
her
lips--at
length
persuaded
me
to
resign
my
unhappy
infant
to
the
grave
yet
i
parted
from
it
with
reluctance
however
reason
at
length
prevailed
i
suffered
it
to
be
taken
from
me
and
it
now
reposes
in
consecrated
ground
i
before
mentioned
that
regularly
once
a
day
camilla
brought
me
food
she
sought
not
to
embitter
my
sorrows
with
reproach
she
bad
me
'tis
true
resign
all
hopes
of
liberty
and
worldly
happiness
but
she
encouraged
me
to
bear
with
patience
my
temporary
distress
and
advised
me
to
draw
comfort
from
religion
my
situation
evidently
affected
her
more
than
she
ventured
to
express
but
she
believed
that
to
extenuate
my
fault
would
make
me
less
anxious
to
repent
it
often
while
her
lips
painted
the
enormity
of
my
guilt
in
glaring
colours
her
eyes
betrayed
how
sensible
she
was
to
my
sufferings
in
fact
i
am
certain
that
none
of
my
tormentors
for
the
three
other
nuns
entered
my
prison
occasionally
were
so
much
actuated
by
the
spirit
of
oppressive
cruelty
as
by
the
idea
that
to
afflict
my
body
was
the
only
way
to
preserve
my
soul
nay
even
this
persuasion
might
not
have
had
such
weight
with
them
and
they
might
have
thought
my
punishment
too
severe
had
not
their
good
dispositions
been
represt
by
blind
obedience
to
their
superior
her
resentment
existed
in
full
force
my
project
of
elopement
having
been
discovered
by
the
abbot
of
the
capuchins
she
supposed
herself
lowered
in
his
opinion
by
my
disgrace
and
in
consequence
her
hate
was
inveterate
she
told
the
nuns
to
whose
custody
i
was
committed
that
my
fault
was
of
the
most
heinous
nature
that
no
sufferings
could
equal
the
offence
and
that
nothing
could
save
me
from
eternal
perdition
but
punishing
my
guilt
with
the
utmost
severity
the
superior's
word
is
an
oracle
to
but
too
many
of
a
convent's
inhabitants
the
nuns
believed
whatever
the
prioress
chose
to
assert
though
contradicted
by
reason
and
charity
they
hesitated
not
to
admit
the
truth
of
her
arguments
they
followed
her
injunctions
to
the
very
letter
and
were
fully
persuaded
that
to
treat
me
with
lenity
or
to
show
the
least
pity
for
my
woes
would
be
a
direct
means
to
destroy
my
chance
for
salvation
camilla
being
most
employed
about
me
was
particularly
charged
by
the
prioress
to
treat
me
with
harshness
in
compliance
with
these
orders
she
frequently
strove
to
convince
me
how
just
was
my
punishment
and
how
enormous
was
my
crime
she
bad
me
think
myself
too
happy
in
saving
my
soul
by
mortifying
my
body
and
even
threatened
me
sometimes
with
eternal
perdition
yet
as
i
before
observed
she
always
concluded
by
words
of
encouragement
and
comfort
and
though
uttered
by
camilla's
lips
i
easily
recognised
the
domina's
expressions
once
and
once
only
the
prioress
visited
me
in
my
dungeon
she
then
treated
me
with
the
most
unrelenting
cruelty
she
loaded
me
with
reproaches
taunted
me
with
my
frailty
and
when
i
implored
her
mercy
told
me
to
ask
it
of
heaven
since
i
deserved
none
on
earth
she
even
gazed
upon
my
lifeless
infant
without
emotion
and
when
she
left
me
i
heard
her
charge
camilla
to
increase
the
hardships
of
my
captivity
unfeeling
woman
but
let
me
check
my
resentment
she
has
expiated
her
errors
by
her
sad
and
unexpected
death
peace
be
with
her
and
may
her
crimes
be
forgiven
in
heaven
as
i
forgive
her
my
sufferings
on
earth
thus
did
i
drag
on
a
miserable
existence
far
from
growing
familiar
with
my
prison
i
beheld
it
every
moment
with
new
horror
the
cold
seemed
more
piercing
and
bitter
the
air
more
thick
and
pestilential
my
frame
became
weak
feverish
and
emaciated
i
was
unable
to
rise
from
the
bed
of
straw
and
exercise
my
limbs
in
the
narrow
limits
to
which
the
length
of
my
chain
permitted
me
to
move
though
exhausted
faint
and
weary
i
trembled
to
profit
by
the
approach
of
sleep
my
slumbers
were
constantly
interrupted
by
some
obnoxious
insect
crawling
over
me
sometimes
i
felt
the
bloated
toad
hideous
and
pampered
with
the
poisonous
vapours
of
the
dungeon
dragging
his
loathsome
length
along
my
bosom
sometimes
the
quick
cold
lizard
rouzed
me
leaving
his
slimy
track
upon
my
face
and
entangling
itself
in
the
tresses
of
my
wild
and
matted
hair
often
have
i
at
waking
found
my
fingers
ringed
with
the
long
worms
which
bred
in
the
corrupted
flesh
of
my
infant
at
such
times
i
shrieked
with
terror
and
disgust
and
while
i
shook
off
the
reptile
trembled
with
all
a
woman's
weakness
such
was
my
situation
when
camilla
was
suddenly
taken
ill
a
dangerous
fever
supposed
to
be
infectious
confined
her
to
her
bed
every
one
except
the
lay-sister
appointed
to
nurse
her
avoided
her
with
caution
and
feared
to
catch
the
disease
she
was
perfectly
delirious
and
by
no
means
capable
of
attending
to
me
the
domina
and
the
nuns
admitted
to
the
mystery
had
latterly
given
me
over
entirely
to
camilla's
care
in
consequence
they
busied
themselves
no
more
about
me
and
occupied
by
preparing
for
the
approaching
festival
it
is
more
than
probable
that
i
never
once
entered
into
their
thoughts
of
the
reason
of
camilla's
negligence
i
have
been
informed
since
my
release
by
the
mother
st
ursula
at
that
time
i
was
very
far
from
suspecting
its
cause
on
the
contrary
i
waited
for
my
gaoler's
appearance
at
first
with
impatience
and
afterwards
with
despair
one
day
passed
away
another
followed
it
the
third
arrived
still
no
camilla
still
no
food
i
knew
the
lapse
of
time
by
the
wasting
of
my
lamp
to
supply
which
fortunately
a
week's
supply
of
oil
had
been
left
me
i
supposed
either
that
the
nuns
had
forgotten
me
or
that
the
domina
had
ordered
them
to
let
me
perish
the
latter
idea
seemed
the
most
probable
yet
so
natural
is
the
love
of
life
that
i
trembled
to
find
it
true
though
embittered
by
every
species
of
misery
my
existence
was
still
dear
to
me
and
i
dreaded
to
lose
it
every
succeeding
minute
proved
to
me
that
i
must
abandon
all
hopes
of
relief
i
was
become
an
absolute
skeleton
my
eyes
already
failed
me
and
my
limbs
were
beginning
to
stiffen
i
could
only
express
my
anguish
and
the
pangs
of
that
hunger
which
gnawed
my
heart-strings
by
frequent
groans
whose
melancholy
sound
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
dungeon
re-echoed
i
resigned
myself
to
my
fate
i
already
expected
the
moment
of
dissolution
when
my
guardian
angel
when
my
beloved
brother
arrived
in
time
to
save
me
my
sight
grown
dim
and
feeble
at
first
refused
to
recognize
him
and
when
i
did
distinguish
his
features
the
sudden
burst
of
rapture
was
too
much
for
me
to
bear
i
was
overpowered
by
the
swell
of
joy
at
once
more
beholding
a
friend
and
that
a
friend
so
dear
to
me
nature
could
not
support
my
emotions
and
took
her
refuge
in
insensibility
you
already
know
what
are
my
obligations
to
the
family
of
villa-franca
but
what
you
cannot
know
is
the
extent
of
my
gratitude
boundless
as
the
excellence
of
my
benefactors
lorenzo
raymond
names
so
dear
to
me
teach
me
to
bear
with
fortitude
this
sudden
transition
from
misery
to
bliss
so
lately
a
captive
opprest
with
chains
perishing
with
hunger
suffering
every
inconvenience
of
cold
and
want
hidden
from
the
light
excluded
from
society
hopeless
neglected
and
as
i
feared
forgotten
now
restored
to
life
and
liberty
enjoying
all
the
comforts
of
affluence
and
ease
surrounded
by
those
who
are
most
loved
by
me
and
on
the
point
of
becoming
his
bride
who
has
long
been
wedded
to
my
heart
my
happiness
is
so
exquisite
so
perfect
that
scarcely
can
my
brain
sustain
the
weight
one
only
wish
remains
ungratified
it
is
to
see
my
brother
in
his
former
health
and
to
know
that
antonia's
memory
is
buried
in
her
grave
granted
this
prayer
i
have
nothing
more
to
desire
i
trust
that
my
past
sufferings
have
purchased
from
heaven
the
pardon
of
my
momentary
weakness
that
i
have
offended
offended
greatly
and
grievously
i
am
fully
conscious
but
let
not
my
husband
because
he
once
conquered
my
virtue
doubt
the
propriety
of
my
future
conduct
i
have
been
frail
and
full
of
error
but
i
yielded
not
to
the
warmth
of
constitution
raymond
affection
for
you
betrayed
me
i
was
too
confident
of
my
strength
but
i
depended
no
less
on
your
honour
than
my
own
i
had
vowed
never
to
see
you
more
had
it
not
been
for
the
consequences
of
that
unguarded
moment
my
resolution
had
been
kept
fate
willed
it
otherwise
and
i
cannot
but
rejoice
at
its
decree
still
my
conduct
has
been
highly
blameable
and
while
i
attempt
to
justify
myself
i
blush
at
recollecting
my
imprudence
let
me
then
dismiss
the
ungrateful
subject
first
assuring
you
raymond
that
you
shall
have
no
cause
to
repent
our
union
and
that
the
more
culpable
have
been
the
errors
of
your
mistress
the
more
exemplary
shall
be
the
conduct
of
your
wife
here
agnes
ceased
and
the
marquis
replied
to
her
address
in
terms
equally
sincere
and
affectionate
lorenzo
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
the
prospect
of
being
so
closely
connected
with
a
man
for
whom
he
had
ever
entertained
the
highest
esteem
the
pope's
bull
had
fully
and
effectually
released
agnes
from
her
religious
engagements
the
marriage
was
therefore
celebrated
as
soon
as
the
needful
preparations
had
been
made
for
the
marquis
wished
to
have
the
ceremony
performed
with
all
possible
splendour
and
publicity
this
being
over
and
the
bride
having
received
the
compliments
of
madrid
she
departed
with
don
raymond
for
his
castle
in
andalusia
lorenzo
accompanied
them
as
did
also
the
marchioness
de
villa-franca
and
her
lovely
daughter
it
is
needless
to
say
that
theodore
was
of
the
party
and
would
be
impossible
to
describe
his
joy
at
his
master's
marriage
previous
to
his
departure
the
marquis
to
atone
in
some
measure
for
his
past
neglect
made
some
enquiries
relative
to
elvira
finding
that
she
as
well
as
her
daughter
had
received
many
services
from
leonella
and
jacintha
he
showed
his
respect
to
the
memory
of
his
sister-in-law
by
making
the
two
women
handsome
presents
lorenzo
followed
his
example--leonella
was
highly
flattered
by
the
attentions
of
noblemen
so
distinguished
and
jacintha
blessed
the
hour
on
which
her
house
was
bewitched
on
her
side
agnes
failed
not
to
reward
her
convent
friends
the
worthy
mother
st
ursula
to
whom
she
owed
her
liberty
was
named
at
her
request
superintendent
of
'the
ladies
of
charity'
this
was
one
of
the
best
and
most
opulent
societies
throughout
spain
bertha
and
cornelia
not
choosing
to
quit
their
friend
were
appointed
to
principal
charges
in
the
same
establishment
as
to
the
nuns
who
had
aided
the
domina
in
persecuting
agnes
camilla
being
confined
by
illness
to
her
bed
had
perished
in
the
flames
which
consumed
st
clare's
convent
mariana
alix
and
violante
as
well
as
two
more
had
fallen
victims
to
the
popular
rage
the
three
others
who
in
council
had
supported
the
domina's
sentence
were
severely
reprimanded
and
banished
to
religious
houses
in
obscure
and
distant
provinces
here
they
languished
away
a
few
years
ashamed
of
their
former
weakness
and
shunned
by
their
companions
with
aversion
and
contempt
nor
was
the
fidelity
of
flora
permitted
to
go
unrewarded
her
wishes
being
consulted
she
declared
herself
impatient
to
revisit
her
native
land
in
consequence
a
passage
was
procured
for
her
to
cuba
where
she
arrived
in
safety
loaded
with
the
presents
of
raymond
and
lorenzo
the
debts
of
gratitude
discharged
agnes
was
at
liberty
to
pursue
her
favourite
plan
lodged
in
the
same
house
lorenzo
and
virginia
were
eternally
together
the
more
he
saw
of
her
the
more
was
he
convinced
of
her
merit
on
her
part
she
laid
herself
out
to
please
and
not
to
succeed
was
for
her
impossible
lorenzo
witnessed
with
admiration
her
beautiful
person
elegant
manners
innumerable
talents
and
sweet
disposition
he
was
also
much
flattered
by
her
prejudice
in
his
favour
which
she
had
not
sufficient
art
to
conceal
however
his
sentiments
partook
not
of
that
ardent
character
which
had
marked
his
affection
for
antonia
the
image
of
that
lovely
and
unfortunate
girl
still
lived
in
his
heart
and
baffled
all
virginia's
efforts
to
displace
it
still
when
the
duke
proposed
to
him
the
match
which
he
wished
to
earnestly
to
take
place
his
nephew
did
not
reject
the
offer
the
urgent
supplications
of
his
friends
and
the
lady's
merit
conquered
his
repugnance
to
entering
into
new
engagements
he
proposed
himself
to
the
marquis
de
villa-franca
and
was
accepted
with
joy
and
gratitude
virginia
became
his
wife
nor
did
she
ever
give
him
cause
to
repent
his
choice
his
esteem
increased
for
her
daily
her
unremitted
endeavours
to
please
him
could
not
but
succeed
his
affection
assumed
stronger
and
warmer
colours
antonia's
image
was
gradually
effaced
from
his
bosom
and
virginia
became
sole
mistress
of
that
heart
which
she
well
deserved
to
possess
without
a
partner
the
remaining
years
of
raymond
and
agnes
of
lorenzo
and
virginia
were
happy
as
can
be
those
allotted
to
mortals
born
to
be
the
prey
of
grief
and
sport
of
disappointment
the
exquisite
sorrows
with
which
they
had
been
afflicted
made
them
think
lightly
of
every
succeeding
woe
they
had
felt
the
sharpest
darts
in
misfortune's
quiver
those
which
remained
appeared
blunt
in
comparison
having
weathered
fate's
heaviest
storms
they
looked
calmly
upon
its
terrors
or
if
ever
they
felt
affliction's
casual
gales
they
seemed
to
them
gentle
as
zephyrs
which
breathe
over
summer-seas
----he
was
a
fell
despightful
fiend
hell
holds
none
worse
in
baleful
bower
below
by
pride
and
wit
and
rage
and
rancor
keened
of
man
alike
if
good
or
bad
the
foe
thomson
on
the
day
following
antonia's
death
all
madrid
was
a
scene
of
consternation
and
amazement
an
archer
who
had
witnessed
the
adventure
in
the
sepulchre
had
indiscreetly
related
the
circumstances
of
the
murder
he
had
also
named
the
perpetrator
the
confusion
was
without
example
which
this
intelligence
raised
among
the
devotees
most
of
them
disbelieved
it
and
went
themselves
to
the
abbey
to
ascertain
the
fact
anxious
to
avoid
the
shame
to
which
their
superior's
ill-conduct
exposed
the
whole
brotherhood
the
monks
assured
the
visitors
that
ambrosio
was
prevented
from
receiving
them
as
usual
by
nothing
but
illness
this
attempt
was
unsuccessful
the
same
excuse
being
repeated
day
after
day
the
archer's
story
gradually
obtained
confidence
his
partizans
abandoned
him
no
one
entertained
a
doubt
of
his
guilt
and
they
who
before
had
been
the
warmest
in
his
praise
were
now
the
most
vociferous
in
his
condemnation
while
his
innocence
or
guilt
was
debated
in
madrid
with
the
utmost
acrimony
ambrosio
was
a
prey
to
the
pangs
of
conscious
villainy
and
the
terrors
of
punishment
impending
over
him
when
he
looked
back
to
the
eminence
on
which
he
had
lately
stood
universally
honoured
and
respected
at
peace
with
the
world
and
with
himself
scarcely
could
he
believe
that
he
was
indeed
the
culprit
whose
crimes
and
whose
fate
he
trembled
to
envisage
but
a
few
weeks
had
elapsed
since
he
was
pure
and
virtuous
courted
by
the
wisest
and
noblest
in
madrid
and
regarded
by
the
people
with
a
reverence
that
approached
idolatry
he
now
saw
himself
stained
with
the
most
loathed
and
monstrous
sins
the
object
of
universal
execration
a
prisoner
of
the
holy
office
and
probably
doomed
to
perish
in
tortures
the
most
severe
he
could
not
hope
to
deceive
his
judges
the
proofs
of
his
guilt
were
too
strong
his
being
in
the
sepulchre
at
so
late
an
hour
his
confusion
at
the
discovery
the
dagger
which
in
his
first
alarm
he
owned
had
been
concealed
by
him
and
the
blood
which
had
spirted
upon
his
habit
from
antonia's
wound
sufficiently
marked
him
out
for
the
assassin
he
waited
with
agony
for
the
day
of
examination
he
had
no
resource
to
comfort
him
in
his
distress
religion
could
not
inspire
him
with
fortitude
if
he
read
the
books
of
morality
which
were
put
into
his
hands
he
saw
in
them
nothing
but
the
enormity
of
his
offences
if
he
attempted
to
pray
he
recollected
that
he
deserved
not
heaven's
protection
and
believed
his
crimes
so
monstrous
as
to
baffle
even
god's
infinite
goodness
for
every
other
sinner
he
thought
there
might
be
hope
but
for
him
there
could
be
none
shuddering
at
the
past
anguished
by
the
present
and
dreading
the
future
thus
passed
he
the
few
days
preceding
that
which
was
marked
for
his
trial
that
day
arrived
at
nine
in
the
morning
his
prison
door
was
unlocked
and
his
gaoler
entering
commanded
him
to
follow
him
he
obeyed
with
trembling
he
was
conducted
into
a
spacious
hall
hung
with
black
cloth
at
the
table
sat
three
grave
stern-looking
men
also
habited
in
black
one
was
the
grand
inquisitor
whom
the
importance
of
this
cause
had
induced
to
examine
into
it
himself
at
a
smaller
table
at
a
little
distance
sat
the
secretary
provided
with
all
necessary
implements
for
writing
ambrosio
was
beckoned
to
advance
and
take
his
station
at
the
lower
end
of
the
table
as
his
eye
glanced
downwards
he
perceived
various
iron
instruments
lying
scattered
upon
the
floor
their
forms
were
unknown
to
him
but
apprehension
immediately
guessed
them
to
be
engines
of
torture
he
turned
pale
and
with
difficulty
prevented
himself
from
sinking
upon
the
ground
profound
silence
prevailed
except
when
the
inquisitors
whispered
a
few
words
among
themselves
mysteriously
near
an
hour
past
away
and
with
every
second
of
it
ambrosio's
fears
grew
more
poignant
at
length
a
small
door
opposite
to
that
by
which
he
had
entered
the
hall
grated
heavily
upon
its
hinges
an
officer
appeared
and
was
immediately
followed
by
the
beautiful
matilda
her
hair
hung
about
her
face
wildly
her
cheeks
were
pale
and
her
eyes
sunk
and
hollow
she
threw
a
melancholy
look
upon
ambrosio
he
replied
by
one
of
aversion
and
reproach
she
was
placed
opposite
to
him
a
bell
then
sounded
thrice
it
was
the
signal
for
opening
the
court
and
the
inquisitors
entered
upon
their
office
in
these
trials
neither
the
accusation
is
mentioned
or
the
name
of
the
accuser
the
prisoners
are
only
asked
whether
they
will
confess
if
they
reply
that
having
no
crime
they
can
make
no
confession
they
are
put
to
the
torture
without
delay
this
is
repeated
at
intervals
either
till
the
suspected
avow
themselves
culpable
or
the
perseverance
of
the
examinants
is
worn
out
and
exhausted
but
without
a
direct
acknowledgment
of
their
guilt
the
inquisition
never
pronounces
the
final
doom
of
its
prisoners
in
general
much
time
is
suffered
to
elapse
without
their
being
questioned
but
ambrosio's
trial
had
been
hastened
on
account
of
a
solemn
auto
da
fe
which
would
take
place
in
a
few
days
and
in
which
the
inquisitors
meant
this
distinguished
culprit
to
perform
a
part
and
give
a
striking
testimony
of
their
vigilance
the
abbot
was
not
merely
accused
of
rape
and
murder
the
crime
of
sorcery
was
laid
to
his
charge
as
well
as
to
matilda's
she
had
been
seized
as
an
accomplice
in
antonia's
assassination
on
searching
her
cell
various
suspicious
books
and
instruments
were
found
which
justified
the
accusation
brought
against
her
to
criminate
the
monk
the
constellated
mirror
was
produced
which
matilda
had
accidentally
left
in
his
chamber
the
strange
figures
engraved
upon
it
caught
the
attention
of
don
ramirez
while
searching
the
abbot's
cell
in
consequence
he
carried
it
away
with
him
it
was
shown
to
the
grand
inquisitor
who
having
considered
it
for
some
time
took
off
a
small
golden
cross
which
hung
at
his
girdle
and
laid
it
upon
the
mirror
instantly
a
loud
noise
was
heard
resembling
a
clap
of
thunder
and
the
steel
shivered
into
a
thousand
pieces
this
circumstance
confirmed
the
suspicion
of
the
monk's
having
dealt
in
magic
it
was
even
supposed
that
his
former
influence
over
the
minds
of
the
people
was
entirely
to
be
ascribed
to
witchcraft
determined
to
make
him
confess
not
only
the
crimes
which
he
had
committed
but
those
also
of
which
he
was
innocent
the
inquisitors
began
their
examination
though
dreading
the
tortures
as
he
dreaded
death
still
more
which
would
consign
him
to
eternal
torments
the
abbot
asserted
his
purity
in
a
voice
bold
and
resolute
matilda
followed
his
example
but
spoke
with
fear
and
trembling
having
in
vain
exhorted
him
to
confess
the
inquisitors
ordered
the
monk
to
be
put
to
the
question
the
decree
was
immediately
executed
ambrosio
suffered
the
most
excruciating
pangs
that
ever
were
invented
by
human
cruelty
yet
so
dreadful
is
death
when
guilt
accompanies
it
that
he
had
sufficient
fortitude
to
persist
in
his
disavowal
his
agonies
were
redoubled
in
consequence
nor
was
he
released
till
fainting
from
excess
of
pain
insensibility
rescued
him
from
the
hands
of
his
tormentors
matilda
was
next
ordered
to
the
torture
but
terrified
by
the
sight
of
the
friar's
sufferings
her
courage
totally
deserted
her
she
sank
upon
her
knees
acknowledged
her
corresponding
with
infernal
spirits
and
that
she
had
witnessed
the
monk's
assassination
of
antonia
but
as
to
the
crime
of
sorcery
she
declared
herself
the
sole
criminal
and
ambrosio
perfectly
innocent
the
latter
assertion
met
with
no
credit
the
abbot
had
recovered
his
senses
in
time
to
hear
the
confession
of
his
accomplice
but
he
was
too
much
enfeebled
by
what
he
had
already
undergone
to
be
capable
at
that
time
of
sustaining
new
torments
he
was
commanded
back
to
his
cell
but
first
informed
that
as
soon
as
he
had
gained
strength
sufficient
he
must
prepare
himself
for
a
second
examination
the
inquisitors
hoped
that
he
would
then
be
less
hardened
and
obstinate
to
matilda
it
was
announced
that
she
must
expiate
her
crime
in
fire
on
the
approaching
auto
da
fe
all
her
tears
and
entreaties
could
procure
no
mitigation
of
her
doom
and
she
was
dragged
by
force
from
the
hall
of
trial
returned
to
his
dungeon
the
sufferings
of
ambrosio's
body
were
far
more
supportable
than
those
of
his
mind
his
dislocated
limbs
the
nails
torn
from
his
hands
and
feet
and
his
fingers
mashed
and
broken
by
the
pressure
of
screws
were
far
surpassed
in
anguish
by
the
agitation
of
his
soul
and
vehemence
of
his
terrors
he
saw
that
guilty
or
innocent
his
judges
were
bent
upon
condemning
him
the
remembrance
of
what
his
denial
had
already
cost
him
terrified
him
at
the
idea
of
being
again
applied
to
the
question
and
almost
engaged
him
to
confess
his
crimes
then
again
the
consequences
of
his
confession
flashed
before
him
and
rendered
him
once
more
irresolute
his
death
would
be
inevitable
and
that
a
death
the
most
dreadful
he
had
listened
to
matilda's
doom
and
doubted
not
that
a
similar
was
reserved
for
him
he
shuddered
at
the
approaching
auto
da
fe
at
the
idea
of
perishing
in
flames
and
only
escaping
from
indurable
torments
to
pass
into
others
more
subtile
and
ever-lasting
with
affright
did
he
bend
his
mind's
eye
on
the
space
beyond
the
grave
nor
could
hide
from
himself
how
justly
he
ought
to
dread
heaven's
vengeance
in
this
labyrinth
of
terrors
fain
would
he
have
taken
his
refuge
in
the
gloom
of
atheism
fain
would
he
have
denied
the
soul's
immortality
have
persuaded
himself
that
when
his
eyes
once
closed
they
would
never
more
open
and
that
the
same
moment
would
annihilate
his
soul
and
body
even
this
resource
was
refused
to
him
to
permit
his
being
blind
to
the
fallacy
of
this
belief
his
knowledge
was
too
extensive
his
understanding
too
solid
and
just
he
could
not
help
feeling
the
existence
of
a
god
those
truths
once
his
comfort
now
presented
themselves
before
him
in
the
clearest
light
but
they
only
served
to
drive
him
to
distraction
they
destroyed
his
ill-grounded
hopes
of
escaping
punishment
and
dispelled
by
the
irresistible
brightness
of
truth
and
convinction
philosophy's
deceitful
vapours
faded
away
like
a
dream
in
anguish
almost
too
great
for
mortal
frame
to
bear
he
expected
the
time
when
he
was
again
to
be
examined
he
busied
himself
in
planning
ineffectual
schemes
for
escaping
both
present
and
future
punishment
of
the
first
there
was
no
possibility
of
the
second
despair
made
him
neglect
the
only
means
while
reason
forced
him
to
acknowledge
a
god's
existence
conscience
made
him
doubt
the
infinity
of
his
goodness
he
disbelieved
that
a
sinner
like
him
could
find
mercy
he
had
not
been
deceived
into
error
ignorance
could
furnish
him
with
no
excuse
he
had
seen
vice
in
her
true
colours
before
he
committed
his
crimes
he
had
computed
every
scruple
of
their
weight
and
yet
he
had
committed
them
'pardon'
he
would
cry
in
an
access
of
phrenzy
'oh
there
can
be
none
for
me'
persuaded
of
this
instead
of
humbling
himself
in
penitence
of
deploring
his
guilt
and
employing
his
few
remaining
hours
in
deprecating
heaven's
wrath
he
abandoned
himself
to
the
transports
of
desperate
rage
he
sorrowed
for
the
punishment
of
his
crimes
not
their
commission
and
exhaled
his
bosom's
anguish
in
idle
sighs
in
vain
lamentations
in
blasphemy
and
despair
as
the
few
beams
of
day
which
pierced
through
the
bars
of
his
prison
window
gradually
disappeared
and
their
place
was
supplied
by
the
pale
and
glimmering
lamp
he
felt
his
terrors
redouble
and
his
ideas
become
more
gloomy
more
solemn
more
despondent
he
dreaded
the
approach
of
sleep
no
sooner
did
his
eyes
close
wearied
with
tears
and
watching
than
the
dreadful
visions
seemed
to
be
realised
on
which
his
mind
had
dwelt
during
the
day
he
found
himself
in
sulphurous
realms
and
burning
caverns
surrounded
by
fiends
appointed
his
tormentors
and
who
drove
him
through
a
variety
of
tortures
each
of
which
was
more
dreadful
than
the
former
amidst
these
dismal
scenes
wandered
the
ghosts
of
elvira
and
her
daughter
they
reproached
him
with
their
deaths
recounted
his
crimes
to
the
daemons
and
urged
them
to
inflict
torments
of
cruelty
yet
more
refined
such
were
the
pictures
which
floated
before
his
eyes
in
sleep
they
vanished
not
till
his
repose
was
disturbed
by
excess
of
agony
then
would
he
start
from
the
ground
on
which
he
had
stretched
himself
his
brows
running
down
with
cold
sweat
his
eyes
wild
and
phrenzied
and
he
only
exchanged
the
terrible
certainty
for
surmizes
scarcely
more
supportable
he
paced
his
dungeon
with
disordered
steps
he
gazed
with
terror
upon
the
surrounding
darkness
and
often
did
he
cry
'oh
fearful
is
night
to
the
guilty'
the
day
of
his
second
examination
was
at
hand
he
had
been
compelled
to
swallow
cordials
whose
virtues
were
calculated
to
restore
his
bodily
strength
and
enable
him
to
support
the
question
longer
on
the
night
preceding
this
dreaded
day
his
fears
for
the
morrow
permitted
him
not
to
sleep
his
terrors
were
so
violent
as
nearly
to
annihilate
his
mental
powers
he
sat
like
one
stupefied
near
the
table
on
which
his
lamp
was
burning
dimly
despair
chained
up
his
faculties
in
idiotism
and
he
remained
for
some
hours
unable
to
speak
or
move
or
indeed
to
think
'look
up
ambrosio'
said
a
voice
in
accents
well-known
to
him--
the
monk
started
and
raised
his
melancholy
eyes
matilda
stood
before
him
she
had
quitted
her
religious
habit
she
now
wore
a
female
dress
at
once
elegant
and
splendid
a
profusion
of
diamonds
blazed
upon
her
robes
and
her
hair
was
confined
by
a
coronet
of
roses
in
her
right
hand
she
held
a
small
book
a
lively
expression
of
pleasure
beamed
upon
her
countenance
but
still
it
was
mingled
with
a
wild
imperious
majesty
which
inspired
the
monk
with
awe
and
represt
in
some
measure
his
transports
at
seeing
her
'you
here
matilda'
he
at
length
exclaimed
'how
have
you
gained
entrance
where
are
your
chains
what
means
this
magnificence
and
the
joy
which
sparkles
in
your
eyes
have
our
judges
relented
is
there
a
chance
of
my
escaping
answer
me
for
pity
and
tell
me
what
i
have
to
hope
or
fear'
'ambrosio'
she
replied
with
an
air
of
commanding
dignity
'i
have
baffled
the
inquisition's
fury
i
am
free
a
few
moments
will
place
kingdoms
between
these
dungeons
and
me
yet
i
purchase
my
liberty
at
a
dear
at
a
dreadful
price
dare
you
pay
the
same
ambrosio
dare
you
spring
without
fear
over
the
bounds
which
separate
men
from
angels--you
are
silent--you
look
upon
me
with
eyes
of
suspicion
and
alarm--i
read
your
thoughts
and
confess
their
justice
yes
ambrosio
i
have
sacrificed
all
for
life
and
liberty
i
am
no
longer
a
candidate
for
heaven
i
have
renounced
god's
service
and
am
enlisted
beneath
the
banners
of
his
foes
the
deed
is
past
recall
yet
were
it
in
my
power
to
go
back
i
would
not
oh
my
friend
to
expire
in
such
torments
to
die
amidst
curses
and
execrations
to
bear
the
insults
of
an
exasperated
mob
to
be
exposed
to
all
the
mortifications
of
shame
and
infamy
who
can
reflect
without
horror
on
such
a
doom
let
me
then
exult
in
my
exchange
i
have
sold
distant
and
uncertain
happiness
for
present
and
secure
i
have
preserved
a
life
which
otherwise
i
had
lost
in
torture
and
i
have
obtained
the
power
of
procuring
every
bliss
which
can
make
that
life
delicious
the
infernal
spirits
obey
me
as
their
sovereign
by
their
aid
shall
my
days
be
past
in
every
refinement
of
luxury
and
voluptuousness
i
will
enjoy
unrestrained
the
gratification
of
my
senses
every
passion
shall
be
indulged
even
to
satiety
then
will
i
bid
my
servants
invent
new
pleasures
to
revive
and
stimulate
my
glutted
appetites
i
go
impatient
to
exercise
my
newly-gained
dominion
i
pant
to
be
at
liberty
nothing
should
hold
me
one
moment
longer
in
this
abhorred
abode
but
the
hope
of
persuading
you
to
follow
my
example
ambrosio
i
still
love
you
our
mutual
guilt
and
danger
have
rendered
you
dearer
to
me
than
ever
and
i
would
fain
save
you
from
impending
destruction
summon
then
your
resolution
to
your
aid
and
renounce
for
immediate
and
certain
benefits
the
hopes
of
a
salvation
difficult
to
obtain
and
perhaps
altogether
erroneous
shake
off
the
prejudice
of
vulgar
souls
abandon
a
god
who
has
abandoned
you
and
raise
yourself
to
the
level
of
superior
beings'
she
paused
for
the
monk's
reply
he
shuddered
while
he
gave
it
'matilda'
he
said
after
a
long
silence
in
a
low
and
unsteady
voice
'what
price
gave
you
for
liberty'
she
answered
him
firm
and
dauntless
'ambrosio
it
was
my
soul'
'wretched
woman
what
have
you
done
pass
but
a
few
years
and
how
dreadful
will
be
your
sufferings'
'weak
man
pass
but
this
night
and
how
dreadful
will
be
your
own
do
you
remember
what
you
have
already
endured
tomorrow
you
must
bear
torments
doubly
exquisite
do
you
remember
the
horrors
of
a
fiery
punishment
in
two
days
you
must
be
led
a
victim
to
the
stake
what
then
will
become
of
you
still
dare
you
hope
for
pardon
still
are
you
beguiled
with
visions
of
salvation
think
upon
your
crimes
think
upon
your
lust
your
perjury
inhumanity
and
hypocrisy
think
upon
the
innocent
blood
which
cries
to
the
throne
of
god
for
vengeance
and
then
hope
for
mercy
then
dream
of
heaven
and
sigh
for
worlds
of
light
and
realms
of
peace
and
pleasure
absurd
open
your
eyes
ambrosio
and
be
prudent
hell
is
your
lot
you
are
doomed
to
eternal
perdition
nought
lies
beyond
your
grave
but
a
gulph
of
devouring
flames
and
will
you
then
speed
towards
that
hell
will
you
clasp
that
perdition
in
your
arms
ere
'tis
needful
will
you
plunge
into
those
flames
while
you
still
have
the
power
to
shun
them
'tis
a
madman's
action
no
no
ambrosio
let
us
for
awhile
fly
from
divine
vengeance
be
advised
by
me
purchase
by
one
moment's
courage
the
bliss
of
years
enjoy
the

behind'
'matilda
your

will
immediately
appear
to
you

you
are

we
shall
meet
again
if

for
ever'
she
let
the
book
fall
upon
the
ground
a
cloud
of
blue
fire
wrapped
itself
round
her
she
waved
her
hand
to
ambrosio
and
disappeared
the
momentary
glare
which
the
flames
poured
through
the
dungeon
on
dissipating
suddenly
seemed
to
have
increased
its
natural
gloom
the
solitary
lamp
scarcely
gave
light
sufficient
to
guide
the
monk
to
a
chair
he
threw
himself
into
his
seat
folded
his
arms
and
leaning
his
head
upon
the
table
sank
into
reflections
perplexing
and
unconnected
he
was
still
in
this
attitude
when
the
opening
of
the
prison
door
rouzed
him
from
his
stupor
he
was
summoned
to
appear
before
the
grand
inquisitor
he
rose
and
followed
his
gaoler
with
painful
steps
he
was
led
into
the
same
hall
placed
before
the
same
examiners
and
was
again
interrogated
whether
he
would
confess
he
replied
as
before
that
having
no
crimes
he
could
acknowledge
none
but
when
the
executioners
prepared
to
put
him
to
the
question
when
he
saw
the
engines
of
torture
and
remembered
the
pangs
which
they
had
already
inflicted
his
resolution
failed
him
entirely
forgetting
the
consequences
and
only
anxious
to
escape
the
terrors
of
the
present
moment
he
made
an
ample
confession
he
disclosed
every
circumstance
of
his
guilt
and
owned
not
merely
the
crimes
with
which
he
was
charged
but
those
of
which
he
had
never
been
suspected
being
interrogated
as
to
matilda's
flight
which
had
created
much
confusion
he
confessed
that
she
had
sold
herself
to
satan
and
that
she
was
indebted
to
sorcery
for
her
escape
he
still
assured
his
judges
that
for
his
own
part
he
had
never
entered
into
any
compact
with
the
infernal
spirits
but
the
threat
of
being
tortured
made
him
declare
himself
to
be
a
sorcerer
and
heretic
and
whatever
other
title
the
inquisitors
chose
to
fix
upon
him
in
consequence
of
this
avowal
his
sentence
was
immediately
pronounced
he
was
ordered
to
prepare
himself
to
perish
in
the
auto
da
fe
which
was
to
be
solemnized
at
twelve
o'clock
that
night
this
hour
was
chosen
from
the
idea
that
the
horror
of
the
flames
being
heightened
by
the
gloom
of
midnight
the
execution
would
have
a
greater
effect
upon
the
mind
of
the
people
ambrosio
rather
dead
than
alive
was
left
alone
in
his
dungeon
the
moment
in
which
this
terrible
decree
was
pronounced
had
nearly
proved
that
of
his
dissolution
he
looked
forward
to
the
morrow
with
despair
and
his
terrors
increased
with
the
approach
of
midnight
sometimes
he
was
buried
in
gloomy
silence
at
others
he
raved
with
delirious
passion
wrung
his
hands
and
cursed
the
hour
when
he
first
beheld
the
light
in
one
of
these
moments
his
eye
rested
upon
matilda's
mysterious
gift
his
transports
of
rage
were
instantly
suspended
he
looked
earnestly
at
the
book
he
took
it
up
but
immediately
threw
it
from
him
with
horror
he
walked
rapidly
up
and
down
his
dungeon
then
stopped
and
again
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
spot
where
the
book
had
fallen
he
reflected
that
here
at
least
was
a
resource
from
the
fate
which
he
dreaded
he
stooped
and
took
it
up
a
second
time
he
remained
for
some
time
trembling
and
irresolute
he
longed
to
try
the
charm
yet
feared
its
consequences
the
recollection
of
his
sentence
at
length
fixed
his
indecision
he
opened
the
volume
but
his
agitation
was
so
great
that
he
at
first
sought
in
vain
for
the
page
mentioned
by
matilda
ashamed
of
himself
he
called
all
his
courage
to
his
aid
he
turned
to
the
seventh
leaf
he
began
to
read
it
aloud
but
his
eyes
frequently
wandered
from
the
book
while
he
anxiously
cast
them
round
in
search
of
the
spirit
whom
he
wished
yet
dreaded
to
behold
still
he
persisted
in
his
design
and
with
a
voice
unassured
and
frequent
interruptions
he
contrived
to
finish
the
four
first
lines
of
the
page
they
were
in
a
language
whose
import
was
totally
unknown
to
him
scarce
had
he
pronounced
the
last
word
when
the
effects
of
the
charm
were
evident
a
loud
burst
of
thunder
was
heard
the
prison
shook
to
its
very
foundations
a
blaze
of
lightning
flashed
through
the
cell
and
in
the
next
moment
borne
upon
sulphurous
whirl-winds
lucifer
stood
before
him
a
second
time
but
he
came
not
as
when
at
matilda's
summons
he
borrowed
the
seraph's
form
to
deceive
ambrosio
he
appeared
in
all
that
ugliness
which
since
his
fall
from
heaven
had
been
his
portion
his
blasted
limbs
still
bore
marks
of
the
almighty's
thunder
a
swarthy
darkness
spread
itself
over
his
gigantic
form
his
hands
and
feet
were
armed
with
long
talons
fury
glared
in
his
eyes
which
might
have
struck
the
bravest
heart
with
terror
over
his
huge
shoulders
waved
two
enormous
sable
wings
and
his
hair
was
supplied
by
living
snakes
which
twined
themselves
round
his
brows
with
frightful
hissings
in
one
hand
he
held
a
roll
of
parchment
and
in
the
other
an
iron
pen
still
the
lightning
flashed
around
him
and
the
thunder
with
repeated
bursts
seemed
to
announce
the
dissolution
of
nature
terrified
at
an
apparition
so
different
from
what
he
had
expected
ambrosio
remained
gazing
upon
the
fiend
deprived
of
the
power
of
utterance
the
thunder
had
ceased
to
roll
universal
silence
reigned
through
the
dungeon
'for
what
am
i
summoned
hither'
said
the
daemon
in
a
voice
which
sulphurous
fogs
had
damped
to
hoarseness--
at
the
sound
nature
seemed
to
tremble
a
violent
earthquake
rocked
the
ground
accompanied
by
a
fresh
burst
of
thunder
louder
and
more
appalling
than
the
first
ambrosio
was
long
unable
to
answer
the
daemon's
demand
'i
am
condemned
to
die'
he
said
with
a
faint
voice
his
blood
running
cold
while
he
gazed
upon
his
dreadful
visitor
'save
me
bear
me
from
hence'
'shall
the
reward
of
my
services
be
paid
me
dare
you
embrace
my
cause
will
you
be
mine
body
and
soul
are
you
prepared
to
renounce
him
who
made
you
and
him
who
died
for
you
answer
but
yes
and
lucifer
is
your
slave'
'will
no
less
price
content
you
can
nothing
satisfy
you
but
my
eternal
ruin
spirit
you
ask
too
much
yet
convey
me
from
this
dungeon
be
my
servant
for
one
hour
and
i
will
be
yours
for
a
thousand
years
will
not
this
offer
suffice'
'it
will
not
i
must
have
your
soul
must
have
it
mine
and
mine
for
ever'
'insatiate
daemon
i
will
not
doom
myself
to
endless
torments
i
will
not
give
up
my
hopes
of
being
one
day
pardoned'
'you
will
not
on
what
chimaera
rest
then
your
hopes
short-sighted
mortal
miserable
wretch
are
you
not
guilty
are
you
not
infamous
in
the
eyes
of
men
and
angels
can
such
enormous
sins
be
forgiven
hope
you
to
escape
my
power
your
fate
is
already
pronounced
the
eternal
has
abandoned
you
mine
you
are
marked
in
the
book
of
destiny
and
mine
you
must
and
shall
be'
'fiend
'tis
false
infinite
is
the
almighty's
mercy
and
the
penitent
shall
meet
his
forgiveness
my
crimes
are
monstrous
but
i
will
not
despair
of
pardon
haply
when
they
have
received
due
chastisement'
'chastisement
was
purgatory
meant
for
guilt
like
yours
hope
you
that
your
offences
shall
be
bought
off
by
prayers
of
superstitious
dotards
and
droning
monks
ambrosio
be
wise

you
must
be
you
are
doomed
to
flames
but
may
shun
them
for
the
present
sign
this
parchment
i
will
bear
you
from
hence
and
you
may
pass
your
remaining
years
in
bliss
and
liberty
enjoy
your
existence
indulge
in
every
pleasure
to
which
appetite
may
lead
you
but
from
the
moment
that
it
quits
your
body
remember
that
your
soul
belongs
to
me
and
that
i
will
not
be
defrauded
of
my
right'
the
monk
was
silent
but
his
looks
declared
that
the
tempter's
words
were
not
thrown
away
he
reflected
on
the
conditions
proposed
with
horror
on
the
other
hand
he
believed
himself
doomed
to
perdition
and
that
by
refusing
the
daemon's
succour
he
only
hastened
tortures
which
he
never
could
escape
the
fiend
saw
that
his
resolution
was
shaken
he
renewed
his
instances
and
endeavoured
to
fix
the
abbot's
indecision
he
described
the
agonies
of
death
in
the
most
terrific
colours
and
he
worked
so
powerfully
upon
ambrosio's
despair
and
fears
that
he
prevailed
upon
him
to
receive
the
parchment
he
then
struck
the
iron
pen
which
he
held
into
a
vein
of
the
monk's
left
hand
it
pierced
deep
and
was
instantly
filled
with
blood
yet
ambrosio
felt
no
pain
from
the
wound
the
pen
was
put
into
his
hand
it
trembled
the
wretch
placed
the
parchment
on
the
table
before
him
and
prepared
to
sign
it
suddenly
he
held
his
hand
he
started
away
hastily
and
threw
the
pen
upon
the
table
'what
am
i
doing'
he
cried--then
turning
to
the
fiend
with
a
desperate
air
'leave
me
begone
i
will
not
sign
the
parchment'
'fool'
exclaimed
the
disappointed
daemon
darting
looks
so
furious
as
penetrated
the
friar's
soul
with
horror
'thus
am
i
trifled
with
go
then
rave
in
agony
expire
in
tortures
and
then
learn
the
extent
of
the
eternal's
mercy
but
beware
how
you
make
me
again
your
mock
call
me
no
more
till
resolved
to
accept
my
offers
summon
me
a
second
time
to
dismiss
me
thus
idly
and
these
talons
shall
rend
you
into
a
thousand
pieces
speak
yet
again
will
you
sign
the
parchment'
'i
will
not
leave
me
away'
instantly
the
thunder
was
heard
to
roll
horribly
once
more
the
earth
trembled
with
violence
the
dungeon
resounded
with
loud
shrieks
and
the
daemon
fled
with
blasphemy
and
curses
at
first
the
monk
rejoiced
at
having
resisted
the
seducer's
arts
and
obtained
a
triumph
over
mankind's
enemy
but
as
the
hour
of
punishment
drew
near
his
former
terrors
revived
in
his
heart
their
momentary
repose
seemed
to
have
given
them
fresh
vigour
the
nearer
that
the
time
approached
the
more
did
he
dread
appearing
before
the
throne
of
god
he
shuddered
to
think
how
soon
he
must
be
plunged
into
eternity
how
soon
meet
the
eyes
of
his
creator
whom
he
had
so
grievously
offended
the
bell
announced
midnight
it
was
the
signal
for
being
led
to
the
stake
as
he
listened
to
the
first
stroke
the
blood
ceased
to
circulate
in
the
abbot's
veins
he
heard
death
and
torture
murmured
in
each
succeeding
sound
he
expected
to
see
the
archers
entering
his
prison
and
as
the
bell
forbore
to
toll
he
seized
the
magic
volume
in
a
fit
of
despair
he
opened
it
turned
hastily
to
the
seventh
page
and
as
if
fearing
to
allow
himself
a
moment's
thought
ran
over
the
fatal
lines
with
rapidity
accompanied
by
his
former
terrors
lucifer
again
stood
before
the
trembler
'you
have
summoned
me'
said
the
fiend
'are
you
determined
to
be
wise
will
you
accept
my
conditions
you
know
them
already
renounce
your
claim
to
salvation
make
over
to
me
your
soul
and
i
bear
you
from
this
dungeon
instantly
yet
is
it
time
resolve
or
it
will
be
too
late
will
you
sign
the
parchment'
'i
must--fate
urges
me
i
accept
your
conditions'
'sign
the
parchment'
replied
the
daemon
in
an
exulting
tone
the
contract
and
the
bloody
pen
still
lay
upon
the
table
ambrosio
drew
near
it
he
prepared
to
sign
his
name
a
moment's
reflection
made
him
hesitate
'hark'
cried
the
tempter
'they
come
be
quick
sign
the
parchment
and
i
bear
you
from
hence
this
moment'
in
effect
the
archers
were
heard
approaching
appointed
to
lead
ambrosio
to
the
stake
the
sound
encouraged
the
monk
in
his
resolution
'what
is
the
import
of
this
writing'
said
he
'it
makes
your
soul
over
to
me
for
ever
and
without
reserve'
'what
am
i
to
receive
in
exchange'
'my
protection
and
release
from
this
dungeon
sign
it
and
this
instant
i
bear
you
away'
ambrosio
took
up
the
pen
he
set
it
to
the
parchment
again
his
courage
failed
him
he
felt
a
pang
of
terror
at
his
heart
and
once
more
threw
the
pen
upon
the
table
'weak
and
puerile'
cried
the
exasperated
fiend
'away
with
this
folly
sign
the
writing
this
instant
or
i
sacrifice
you
to
my
rage'
at
this
moment
the
bolt
of
the
outward
door
was
drawn
back
the
prisoner
heard
the
rattling
of
chains
the
heavy
bar
fell
the
archers
were
on
the
point
of
entering
worked
up
to
phrenzy
by
the
urgent
danger
shrinking
from
the
approach
of
death
terrified
by
the
daemon's
threats
and
seeing
no
other
means
to
escape
destruction
the
wretched
monk
complied
he
signed
the
fatal
contract
and
gave
it
hastily
into
the
evil
spirit's
hands
whose
eyes
as
he
received
the
gift
glared
with
malicious
rapture
'take
it'
said
the
god-abandoned
'now
then
save
me
snatch
me
from
hence'
'hold
do
you
freely
and
absolutely
renounce
your
creator
and
his
son'
'i
do
i
do'
'do
you
make
over
your
soul
to
me
for
ever'
'for
ever'
'without
reserve
or
subterfuge
without
future
appeal
to
the
divine
mercy'
the
last
chain
fell
from
the
door
of
the
prison
the
key
was
heard
turning
in
the
lock
already
the
iron
door
grated
heavily
upon
its
rusty
hinges
'i
am
yours
for
ever
and
irrevocably'
cried
the
monk
wild
with
terror
'i
abandon
all
claim
to
salvation
i
own
no
power
but
yours
hark
hark
they
come
oh
save
me
bear
me
away'
'i
have
triumphed
you
are
mine
past
reprieve
and
i
fulfil
my
promise'
while
he
spoke
the
door
unclosed
instantly
the
daemon
grasped
one
of
ambrosio's
arms
spread
his
broad
pinions
and
sprang
with
him
into
the
air
the
roof
opened
as
they
soared
upwards
and
closed
again
when
they
had
quitted
the
dungeon
in
the
meanwhile
the
gaoler
was
thrown
into
the
utmost
surprize
by
the
disappearance
of
his
prisoner
though
neither
he
nor
the
archers
were
in
time
to
witness
the
monk's
escape
a
sulphurous
smell
prevailing
through
the
prison
sufficiently
informed
them
by
whose
aid
he
had
been
liberated
they
hastened
to
make
their
report
to
the
grand
inquisitor
the
story
how
a
sorcerer
had
been
carried
away
by
the
devil
was
soon
noised
about
madrid
and
for
some
days
the
whole
city
was
employed
in
discussing
the
subject
gradually
it
ceased
to
be
the
topic
of
conversation
other
adventures
arose
whose
novelty
engaged
universal
attention
and
ambrosio
was
soon
forgotten
as
totally
as
if
he
never
had
existed
while
this
was
passing
the
monk
supported
by
his
infernal
guide
traversed
the
air
with
the
rapidity
of
an
arrow
and
a
few
moments
placed
him
upon
a
precipice's
brink
the
steepest
in
sierra
morena
though
rescued
from
the
inquisition
ambrosio
as
yet
was
insensible
of
the
blessings
of
liberty
the
damning
contract
weighed
heavy
upon
his
mind
and
the
scenes
in
which
he
had
been
a
principal
actor
had
left
behind
them
such
impressions
as
rendered
his
heart
the
seat
of
anarchy
and
confusion
the
objects
now
before
his
eyes
and
which
the
full
moon
sailing
through
clouds
permitted
him
to
examine
were
ill-calculated
to
inspire
that
calm
of
which
he
stood
so
much
in
need
the
disorder
of
his
imagination
was
increased
by
the
wildness
of
the
surrounding
scenery
by
the
gloomy
caverns
and
steep
rocks
rising
above
each
other
and
dividing
the
passing
clouds
solitary
clusters
of
trees
scattered
here
and
there
among
whose
thick-twined
branches
the
wind
of
night
sighed
hoarsely
and
mournfully
the
shrill
cry
of
mountain
eagles
who
had
built
their
nests
among
these
lonely
desarts
the
stunning
roar
of
torrents
as
swelled
by
late
rains
they
rushed
violently
down
tremendous
precipices
and
the
dark
waters
of
a
silent
sluggish
stream
which
faintly
reflected
the
moonbeams
and
bathed
the
rock's
base
on
which
ambrosio
stood
the
abbot
cast
round
him
a
look
of
terror
his
infernal
conductor
was
still
by
his
side
and
eyed
him
with
a
look
of
mingled
malice
exultation
and
contempt
'whither
have
you
brought
me'
said
the
monk
at
length
in
an
hollow
trembling
voice
'why
am
i
placed
in
this
melancholy
scene
bear
me
from
it
quickly
carry
me
to
matilda'
the
fiend
replied
not
but
continued
to
gaze
upon
him
in
silence
ambrosio
could
not
sustain
his
glance
he
turned
away
his
eyes
while
thus
spoke
the
daemon
'i
have
him
then
in
my
power
this
model
of
piety
this
being
without
reproach
this
mortal
who
placed
his
puny
virtues
on
a
level
with
those
of
angels
he
is
mine
irrevocably
eternally
mine
companions
of
my
sufferings
denizens
of
hell
how
grateful
will
be
my
present'
he
paused
then
addressed
himself
to
the
monk----
'carry
you
to
matilda'
he
continued
repeating
ambrosio's
words
'wretch
you
shall
soon
be
with
her
you
well
deserve
a
place
near
her
for
hell
boasts
no
miscreant
more
guilty
than
yourself
hark
ambrosio
while
i
unveil
your
crimes
you
have
shed
the
blood
of
two
innocents
antonia
and
elvira
perished
by
your
hand
that
antonia
whom
you
violated
was
your
sister
that
elvira
whom
you
murdered
gave
you
birth
tremble
abandoned
hypocrite
inhuman
parricide
incestuous
ravisher
tremble
at
the
extent
of
your
offences
and
you
it
was
who
thought
yourself
proof
against
temptation
absolved
from
human
frailties
and
free
from
error
and
vice
is
pride
then
a
virtue
is
inhumanity
no
fault
know
vain
man
that
i
long
have
marked
you
for
my
prey
i
watched
the
movements
of
your
heart
i
saw
that
you
were
virtuous
from
vanity
not
principle
and
i
seized
the
fit
moment
of
seduction
i
observed
your
blind
idolatry
of
the
madona's
picture
i
bad
a
subordinate
but
crafty
spirit
assume
a
similar
form
and
you
eagerly
yielded
to
the
blandishments
of
matilda
your
pride
was
gratified
by
her
flattery
your
lust
only
needed
an
opportunity
to
break
forth
you
ran
into
the
snare
blindly
and
scrupled
not
to
commit
a
crime
which
you
blamed
in
another
with
unfeeling
severity
it
was
i
who
threw
matilda
in
your
way
it
was
i
who
gave
you
entrance
to
antonia's
chamber
it
was
i
who
caused
the
dagger
to
be
given
you
which
pierced
your
sister's
bosom
and
it
was
i
who
warned
elvira
in
dreams
of
your
designs
upon
her
daughter
and
thus
by
preventing
your
profiting
by
her
sleep
compelled
you
to
add
rape
as
well
as
incest
to
the
catalogue
of
your
crimes
hear
hear
ambrosio
had
you
resisted
me
one
minute
longer
you
had
saved
your
body
and
soul
the
guards
whom
you
heard
at
your
prison
door
came
to
signify
your
pardon
but
i
had
already
triumphed
my
plots
had
already
succeeded
scarcely
could
i
propose
crimes
so
quick
as
you
performed
them
you
are
mine
and
heaven
itself
cannot
rescue
you
from
my
power
hope
not
that
your
penitence
will
make
void
our
contract
here
is
your
bond
signed
with
your
blood
you
have
given
up
your
claim
to
mercy
and
nothing
can
restore
to
you
the
rights
which
you
have
foolishly
resigned
believe
you
that
your
secret
thoughts
escaped
me
no
no
i
read
them
all
you
trusted
that
you
should
still
have
time
for
repentance
i
saw
your
artifice
knew
its
falsity
and
rejoiced
in
deceiving
the
deceiver
you
are
mine
beyond
reprieve
i
burn
to
possess
my
right
and
alive
you
quit
not
these
mountains'
during
the
daemon's
speech
ambrosio
had
been
stupefied
by
terror
and
surprize
this
last
declaration
rouzed
him
'not
quit
these
mountains
alive'
he
exclaimed
'perfidious
what
mean
you
have
you
forgotten
our
contract'
the
fiend
answered
by
a
malicious
laugh
'our
contract
have
i
not
performed
my
part
what
more
did
i
promise
than
to
save
you
from
your
prison
have
i
not
done
so
are
you
not
safe
from
the
inquisition--safe
from
all
but
from
me
fool
that
you
were
to
confide
yourself
to
a
devil
why
did
you
not
stipulate
for
life
and
power
and
pleasure
then
all
would
have
been
granted
now
your
reflections
come
too
late
miscreant
prepare
for
death
you
have
not
many
hours
to
live'
on
hearing
this
sentence
dreadful
were
the
feelings
of
the
devoted
wretch
he
sank
upon
his
knees
and
raised
his
hands
towards
heaven
the
fiend
read
his
intention
and
prevented
it--
'what'
he
cried
darting
at
him
a
look
of
fury
'dare
you
still
implore
the
eternal's
mercy
would
you
feign
penitence
and
again
act
an
hypocrite's
part
villain
resign
your
hopes
of
pardon
thus
i
secure
my
prey'
as
he
said
this
darting
his
talons
into
the
monk's
shaven
crown
he
sprang
with
him
from
the
rock
the
caves
and
mountains
rang
with
ambrosio's
shrieks
the
daemon
continued
to
soar
aloft
till
reaching
a
dreadful
height
he
released
the
sufferer
headlong
fell
the
monk
through
the
airy
waste
the
sharp
point
of
a
rock
received
him
and
he
rolled
from
precipice
to
precipice
till
bruised
and
mangled
he
rested
on
the
river's
banks
life
still
existed
in
his
miserable
frame
he
attempted
in
vain
to
raise
himself
his
broken
and
dislocated
limbs
refused
to
perform
their
office
nor
was
he
able
to
quit
the
spot
where
he
had
first
fallen
the
sun
now
rose
above
the
horizon
its
scorching
beams
darted
full
upon
the
head
of
the
expiring
sinner
myriads
of
insects
were
called
forth
by
the
warmth
they
drank
the
blood
which
trickled
from
ambrosio's
wounds
he
had
no
power
to
drive
them
from
him
and
they
fastened
upon
his
sores
darted
their
stings
into
his
body
covered
him
with
their
multitudes
and
inflicted
on
him
tortures
the
most
exquisite
and
insupportable
the
eagles
of
the
rock
tore
his
flesh
piecemeal
and
dug
out
his
eyeballs
with
their
crooked
beaks

burning
thirst

him
he
heard
the
river's
murmur
as
it
rolled
beside
him
but
strove
in
vain
to
drag
himself
towards
the
sound
blind
maimed
helpless
and
despairing
venting
his
rage
in
blasphemy
and
curses
execrating
his
existence
yet
dreading
the
arrival
of
