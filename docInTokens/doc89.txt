brother
you
ask
me
if
i
have
ever
loved
yes
my
story
is
a
strange
and
terrible
one
and
though
i
am
sixty-six
years
of
age
i
scarcely
dare
even
now
to
disturb
the
ashes
of
that
memory
to
you
i
can
refuse
nothing
but
i
should
not
relate
such
a
tale
to
any
less
experienced
mind
so
strange
were
the
circumstances
of
my
story
that
i
can
scarcely
believe
myself
to
have
ever
actually
been
a
party
to
them
for
more
than
three
years
i
remained
the
victim
of
a
most
singular
and
diabolical
illusion
poor
country
priest
though
i
was
i
led
every
night
in
a
dream--would
to
god
it
had
been
all
a
dream--a
most
worldly
life
a
damning
life
a
life
of
sardanapalus
one
single
look
too
freely
cast
upon
a
woman
well-nigh
caused
me
to
lose
my
soul
but
finally
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
assistance
of
my
patron
saint
i
succeeded
in
casting
out
the
evil
spirit
that
possessed
me
my
daily
life
was
long
interwoven
with
a
nocturnal
life
of
a
totally
different
character
by
day
i
was
a
priest
of
the
lord
occupied
with
prayer
and
sacred
things
by
night
from
the
instant
that
i
closed
my
eyes
i
became
a
young
nobleman
a
fine
connoisseur
in
women
dogs
and
horses
gambling
drinking
and
blaspheming
and
when
i
awoke
at
early
daybreak
it
seemed
to
me
on
the
other
hand
that
i
had
been
sleeping
and
had
only
dreamed
that
i
was
a
priest
of
this
somnambulistic
life
there
now
remains
to
me
only
the
recollection
of
certain
scenes
and
words
which
i
cannot
banish
from
my
memory
but
although
i
never
actually
left
the
walls
of
my
presbytery
one
would
think
to
hear
me
speak
that
i
were
a
man
who
weary
of
all
worldly
pleasures
had
become
a
religious
seeking
to
end
a
tempestuous
life
in
the
service
of
god
rather
than
a
humble
seminarist
who
has
grown
old
in
this
obscure
curacy
situated
in
the
depths
of
the
woods
and
even
isolated
from
the
life
of
the
century
yes
i
have
loved
as
none
in
the
world
ever
loved--with
an
insensate
and
furious
passion--so
violent
that
i
am
astonished
it
did
not
cause
my
heart
to
burst
asunder
ah
what
nights--what
nights
from
my
earliest
childhood
i
had
felt
a
vocation
to
the
priesthood
so
that
all
my
studies
were
directed
with
that
idea
in
view
up
to
the
age
of
twenty-four
my
life
had
been
only
a
prolonged
novitiate
having
completed
my
course
of
theology
i
successively
received
all
the
minor
orders
and
my
superiors
judged
me
worthy
despite
my
youth
to
pass
the
last
awful
degree
my
ordination
was
fixed
for
easter
week
i
had
never
gone
into
the
world
my
world
was
confined
by
the
walls
of
the
college
and
the
seminary
i
knew
in
a
vague
sort
of
a
way
that
there
was
something
called
woman
but
i
never
permitted
my
thoughts
to
dwell
on
such
a
subject
and
i
lived
in
a
state
of
perfect
innocence
twice
a
year
only
i
saw
my
infirm
and
aged
mother
and
in
those
visits
were
comprised
my
sole
relations
with
the
outer
world
i
regretted
nothing
i
felt
not
the
least
hesitation
at
taking
the
last
irrevocable
step
i
was
filled
with
joy
and
impatience
never
did
a
betrothed
lover
count
the
slow
hours
with
more
feverish
ardour
i
slept
only
to
dream
that
i
was
saying
mass
i
believed
there
could
be
nothing
in
the
world
more
delightful
than
to
be
a
priest
i
would
have
refused
to
be
a
king
or
a
poet
in
preference
my
ambition
could
conceive
of
no
loftier
aim
i
tell
you
this
in
order
to
show
you
that
what
happened
to
me
could
not
have
happened
in
the
natural
order
of
things
and
to
enable
you
to
understand
that
i
was
the
victim
of
an
inexplicable
fascination
at
last
the
great
day
came
i
walked
to
the
church
with
a
step
so
light
that
i
fancied
myself
sustained
in
air
or
that
i
had
wings
upon
my
shoulders
i
believed
myself
an
angel
and
wondered
at
the
sombre
and
thoughtful
faces
of
my
companions
for
there
were
several
of
us
i
had
passed
all
the
night
in
prayer
and
was
in
a
condition
wellnigh
bordering
on
ecstasy
the
bishop
a
venerable
old
man
seemed
to
me
god
the
father
leaning
over
his
eternity
and
i
beheld
heaven
through
the
vault
of
the
temple
you
well
know
the
details
of
that
ceremony--the
benediction
the
communion
under
both
forms
the
anointing
of
the
palms
of
the
hands
with
the
oil
of
catechumens
and
then
the
holy
sacrifice
offered
in
concert
with
the
bishop
ah
truly
spake
job
when
he
declared
that
the
imprudent
man
is
one
who
hath
not
made
a
covenant
with
his
eyes
i
accidentally
lifted
my
head
which
until
then
i
had
kept
down
and
beheld
before
me
so
close
that
it
seemed
that
i
could
have
touched
her--although
she
was
actually
a
considerable
distance
from
me
and
on
the
further
side
of
the
sanctuary
railing--a
young
woman
of
extraordinary
beauty
and
attired
with
royal
magnificence
it
seemed
as
though
scales
had
suddenly
fallen
from
my
eyes
i
felt
like
a
blind
man
who
unexpectedly
recovers
his
sight
the
bishop
so
radiantly
glorious
but
an
instant
before
suddenly
vanished
away
the
tapers
paled
upon
their
golden
candlesticks
like
stars
in
the
dawn
and
a
vast
darkness
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
church
the
charming
creature
appeared
in
bright
relief
against
the
background
of
that
darkness
like
some
angelic
revelation
she
seemed
herself
radiant
and
radiating
light
rather
than
receiving
it
i
lowered
my
eyelids
firmly
resolved
not
to
again
open
them
that
i
might
not
be
influenced
by
external
objects
for
distraction
had
gradually
taken
possession
of
me
until
i
hardly
knew
what
i
was
doing
in
another
minute
nevertheless
i
reopened
my
eyes
for
through
my
eyelashes
i
still
beheld
her
all
sparkling
with
prismatic
colours
and
surrounded
with
such
a
penumbra
as
one
beholds
in
gazing
at
the
sun
oh
how
beautiful
she
was
the
greatest
painters
who
followed
ideal
beauty
into
heaven
itself
and
thence
brought
back
to
earth
the
true
portrait
of
the
madonna
never
in
their
delineations
even
approached
that
wildly
beautiful
reality
which
i
saw
before
me
neither
the
verses
of
the
poet
nor
the
palette
of
the
artist
could
convey
any
conception
of
her
she
was
rather
tall
with
a
form
and
bearing
of
a
goddess
her
hair
of
a
soft
blonde
hue
was
parted
in
the
midst
and
flowed
back
over
her
temples
in
two
rivers
of
rippling
gold
she
seemed
a
diademed
queen
her
forehead
bluish-white
in
its
transparency
extended
its
calm
breadth
above
the
arches
of
her
eyebrows
which
by
a
strange
singularity
were
almost
black
and
admirably
relieved
the
effect
of
sea-green
eyes
of
unsustainable
vivacity
and
brilliancy
what
eyes
with
a
single
flash
they
could
have
decided
a
manâ€™s
destiny
they
had
a
life
a
limpidity
an
ardour
a
humid
light
which
i
have
never
seen
in
human
eyes
they
shot
forth
rays
like
arrows
which
i
could
distinctly
see
enter
my
heart
i
know
not
if
the
fire
which
illumined
them
came
from
heaven
or
from
hell
but
assuredly
it
came
from
one
or
the
other
that
woman
was
either
an
angel
or
a
demon
perhaps
both
assuredly
she
never
sprang
from
the
flank
of
eve
our
common
mother
teeth
of
the
most
lustrous
pearl
gleamed
in
her
ruddy
smile
and
at
every
inflection
of
her
lips
little
dimples
appeared
in
the
satiny
rose
of
her
adorable
cheeks
there
was
a
delicacy
and
pride
in
the
regal
outline
of
her
nostrils
bespeaking
noble
blood
agate
gleams
played
over
the
smooth
lustrous
skin
of
her
half-bare
shoulders
and
strings
of
great
blonde
pearls--almost
equal
to
her
neck
in
beauty
of
colour--descended
upon
her
bosom
from
time
to
time
she
elevated
her
head
with
the
undulating
grace
of
a
startled
serpent
or
peacock
thereby
imparting
a
quivering
motion
to
the
high
lace
ruff
which
surrounded
it
like
a
silver
trellis-work
she
wore
a
robe
of
orange-red
velvet
and
from
her
wide
ermine-lined
sleeves
there
peeped
forth
patrician
hands
of
infinite
delicacy
and
so
ideally
transparent
that
like
the
fingers
of
aurora
they
permitted
the
light
to
shine
through
them
all
these
details
i
can
recollect
at
this
moment
as
plainly
as
though
they
were
of
yesterday
for
notwithstanding
i
was
greatly
troubled
at
the
time
nothing
escaped
me
the
faintest
touch
of
shading
the
little
dark
speck
at
the
point
of
the
chin
the
imperceptible
down
at
the
corners
of
the
lips
the
velvety
floss
upon
the
brow
the
quivering
shadows
of
the
eyelashes
upon
the
cheeks--i
could
notice
everything
with
astonishing
lucidity
of
perception
and
gazing
i
felt
opening
within
me
gates
that
had
until
then
remained
closed
vents
long
obstructed
became
all
clear
permitting
glimpses
of
unfamiliar
perspectives
within
life
suddenly
made
itself
visible
to
me
under
a
totally
novel
aspect
i
felt
as
though
i
had
just
been
born
into
a
new
world
and
a
new
order
of
things
a
frightful
anguish
commenced
to
torture-my
heart
as
with
red-hot
pincers
every
successive
minute
seemed
to
me
at
once
but
a
second
and
yet
a
century
meanwhile
the
ceremony
was
proceeding
and
i
shortly
found
myself
transported
far
from
that
world
of
which
my
newly
born
desires
were
furiously
besieging
the
entrance
nevertheless
i
answered
â€˜yesâ€™
when
i
wished
to
say
â€˜noâ€™
though
all
within
me
protested
against
the
violence
done
to
my
soul
by
my
tongue
some
occult
power
seemed
to
force
the
words
from
my
throat
against
my
will
thus
it
is
perhaps
that
so
many
young
girls
walk
to
the
altar
firmly
resolved
to
refuse
in
a
startling
manner
the
husband
imposed
upon
them
and
that
yet
not
one
ever
fulfils
her
intention
thus
it
is
doubtless
that
so
many
poor
novices
take
the
veil
though
they
have
resolved
to
tear
it
into
shreds
at
the
moment
when
called
upon
to
utter
the
vows
one
dares
not
thus
cause
so
great
a
scandal
to
all
present
nor
deceive
the
expectation
of
so
many
people
all
those
eyes
all
those
wills
seem
to
weigh
down
upon
you
like
a
cope
of
lead
and
moreover
measures
have
been
so
well
taken
everything
has
been
so
thoroughly
arranged
beforehand
and
after
a
fashion
so
evidently
irrevocable
that
the
will
yields
to
the
weight
of
circumstances
and
utterly
breaks
down
as
the
ceremony
proceeded
the
features
of
the
fair
unknown
changed
their
expression
her
look
had
at
first
been
one
of
caressing
tenderness
it
changed
to
an
air
of
disdain
and
of
mortification
as
though
at
not
having
been
able
to
make
itself
understood
with
an
effort
of
will
sufficient
to
have
uprooted
a
mountain
i
strove
to
cry
out
that
i
would
not
be
a
priest
but
i
could
not
speak
my
tongue
seemed
nailed
to
my
palate
and
i
found
it
impossible
to
express
my
will
by
the
least
syllable
of
negation
though
fully
awake
i
felt
like
one
under
the
influence
of
a
nightmare
who
vainly
strives
to
shriek
out
the
one
word
upon
which
life
depends
she
seemed
conscious
of
the
martyrdom
i
was
undergoing
and
as
though
to
encourage
me
she
gave
me
a
look
replete
with
divinest
promise
her
eyes
were
a
poem
their
every
glance
was
a
song
she
said
to
me
â€˜if
thou
wilt
be
mine
i
shall
make
thee
happier
than
god
himself
in
his
paradise
the
angels
themselves
will
be
jealous
of
thee
tear
off
that
funeral
shroud
in
which
thou
art
about
to
wrap
thyself
i
am
beauty
i
am
youth
i
am
life
come
to
me
together
we
shall
be
love
can
jehovah
offer
thee
aught
in
exchange
our
lives
will
flow
on
like
a
dream
in
one
eternal
kiss
â€˜fling
forth
the
wine
of
that
chalice
and
thou
art
free
i
will
conduct
thee
to
the
unknown
isles
thou
shalt
sleep
in
my
bosom
upon
a
bed
of
massy
gold
under
a
silver
pavilion
for
i
love
thee
and
would
take
thee
away
from
thy
god
before
whom
so
many
noble
hearts
pour
forth
floods
of
love
which
never
reach
even
the
steps
of
his
throneâ€™
these
words
seemed
to
float
to
my
ears
in
a
rhythm
of
infinite
sweetness
for
her
look
was
actually
sonorous
and
the
utterances
of
her
eyes
were
reechoed
in
the
depths
of
my
heart
as
though
living
lips
had
breathed
them
into
my
life
i
felt
myself
willing
to
renounce
god
and
yet
my
tongue
mechanically
fulfilled
all
the
formalities
of
the
ceremony
the
fair
one
gave
me
another
look
so
beseeching
so
despairing
that
keen
blades
seemed
to
pierce
my
heart
and
i
felt
my
bosom
transfixed
by
more
swords
than
those
of
our
lady
of
sorrows
all
was
consummated
i
had
become
a
priest
never
was
deeper
anguish
painted
on
human
face
than
upon
hers
the
maiden
who
beholds
her
affianced
lover
suddenly
fall
dead
at
her
side
the
mother
bending
over
the
empty
cradle
of
her
child
eve
seated
at
the
threshold
of
the
gate
of
paradise
the
miser
who
finds
a
stone
substituted
for
his
stolen
treasure
the
poet
who
accidentally
permits
the
only
manuscript
of
his
finest
work
to
fall
into
the
fire
could
not
wear
a
look
so
despairing
so
inconsolable
all
the
blood
had
abandoned
her
charming
face
leaving
it
whiter
than
marble
her
beautiful
arms
hung
lifelessly
on
either
side
of
her
body
as
though
their
muscles
had
suddenly
relaxed
and
she
sought
the
support
of
a
pillar
for
her
yielding
limbs
almost
betrayed
her
as
for
myself
i
staggered
toward
the
door
of
the
church
livid
as
death
my
forehead
bathed
with
a
sweat
bloodier
than
that
of
calvary
i
felt
as
though
i
were
being
strangled
the
vault
seemed
to
have
flattened
down
upon
my
shoulders
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
head
alone
sustained
the
whole
weight
of
the
dome
as
i
was
about
to
cross
the
threshold
a
hand
suddenly
caught
mine--a
womanâ€™s
hand
i
had
never
till
then
touched
the
hand
of
any
woman
it
was
cold
as
a
serpentâ€™s
skin
and
yet
its
impress
remained
upon
my
wrist
burnt
there
as
though
branded
by
a
glowing
iron
it
was
she
â€˜unhappy
man
unhappy
man
what
hast
thou
doneâ€™
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
and
immediately
disappeared
in
the
crowd
the
aged
bishop
passed
by
he
cast
a
severe
and
scrutinising
look
upon
me
my
face
presented
the
wildest
aspect
imaginable
i
blushed
and
turned
pale
alternately
dazzling
lights
flashed
before
my
eyes
a
companion
took
pity
on
me
he
seized
my
arm
and
led
me
out
i
could
not
possibly
have
found
my
way
back
to
the
seminary
unassisted
at
the
corner
of
a
street
while
the
young
priestâ€™s
attention
was
momentarily
turned
in
another
direction
a
negro
page
fantastically
garbed
approached
me
and
without
pausing
on
his
way
slipped
into
my
hand
a
little
pocket-book
with
gold-embroidered
corners
at
the
same
time
giving
me
a
sign
to
hide
it
i
concealed
it
in
my
sleeve
and
there
kept
it
until
i
found
myself
alone
in
my
cell
then
i
opened
the
clasp
there
were
only
two
leaves
within
bearing
the
words
â€˜clarimonde
at
the
concini
palaceâ€™
so
little
acquainted
was
i
at
that
time
with
the
things
of
this
world
that
i
had
never
heard
of
clarimonde
celebrated
as
she
was
and
i
had
no
idea
as
to
where
the
concini
palace
was
situated
i
hazarded
a
thousand
conjectures
each
more
extravagant
than
the
last
but
in
truth
i
cared
little
whether
she
were
a
great
lady
or
a
courtesan
so
that
i
could
but
see
her
once
more
my
love
although
the
growth
of
a
single
hour
had
taken
imperishable
root
i
did
not
even
dream
of
attempting
to
tear
it
up
so
fully
was
i
convinced
such
a
thing
would
be
impossible
that
woman
had
completely
taken
possession
of
me
one
look
from
her
had
sufficed
to
change
my
very
nature
she
had
breathed
her
will
into
my
life
and
i
no
longer
lived
in
myself
but
in
her
and
for
her
i
gave
myself
up
to
a
thousand
extravagancies
i
kissed
the
place
upon
my
hand
which
she
had
touched
and
i
repeated
her
name
over
and
over
again
for
hours
in
succession
i
only
needed
to
close
my
eyes
in
order
to
see
her
distinctly
as
though
she
were
actually
present
and
i
reiterated
to
myself
the
words
she
had
uttered
in
my
ear
at
the
church
porch
â€˜unhappy
man
unhappy
man
what
hast
thou
doneâ€™
i
comprehended
at
last
the
full
horror
of
my
situation
and
the
funereal
and
awful
restraints
of
the
state
into
which
i
had
just
entered
became
clearly
revealed
to
me
to
be
a
priest--that
is
to
be
chaste
to
never
love
to
observe
no
distinction
of
sex
or
age
to
turn
from
the
sight
of
all
beauty
to
put
out
oneâ€™s
own
eyes
to
hide
for
ever
crouching
in
the
chill
shadows
of
some
church
or
cloister
to
visit
none
but
the
dying
to
watch
by
unknown
corpses
and
ever
bear
about
with
one
the
black
soutane
as
a
garb
of
mourning
for
oneself
so
that
your
very
dress
might
serve
as
a
pall
for
your
coffin
and
i
felt
life
rising
within
me
like
a
subterranean
lake
expanding
and
overflowing
my
blood
leaped
fiercely
through
my
arteries
my
long-restrained
youth
suddenly
burst
into
active
being
like
the
aloe
which
blooms
but
once
in
a
hundred
years
and
then
bursts
into
blossom
with
a
clap
of
thunder
what
could
i
do
in
order
to
see
clarimonde
once
more
i
had
no
pretext
to
offer
for
desiring
to
leave
the
seminary
not
knowing
any
person
in
the
city
i
would
not
even
be
able
to
remain
there
but
a
short
time
and
was
only
waiting
my
assignment
to
the
curacy
which
i
must
thereafter
occupy
i
tried
to
remove
the
bars
of
the
window
but
it
was
at
a
fearful
height
from
the
ground
and
i
found
that
as
i
had
no
ladder
it
would
be
useless
to
think
of
escaping
thus
and
furthermore
i
could
descend
thence
only
by
night
in
any
event
and
afterward
how
should
i
be
able
to
find
my
way
through
the
inextricable
labyrinth
of
streets
all
these
difficulties
which
to
many
would
have
appeared
altogether
insignificant
were
gigantic
to
me
a
poor
seminarist
who
had
fallen
in
love
only
the
day
before
for
the
first
time
without
experience
without
money
without
attire
â€˜ahâ€™
cried
i
to
myself
in
my
blindness
â€˜were
i
not
a
priest
i
could
have
seen
her
every
day
i
might
have
been
her
lover
her
spouse
instead
of
being
wrapped
in
this
dismal
shroud
of
mine
i
would
have
had
garments
of
silk
and
velvet
golden
chains
a
sword
and
fair
plumes
like
other
handsome
young
cavaliers
my
hair
instead
of
being
dishonoured
by
the
tonsure
would
flow
down
upon
my
neck
in
waving
curls
i
would
have
a
fine
waxed
moustache
i
would
be
a
gallantâ€™
but
one
hour
passed
before
an
altar
a
few
hastily
articulated
words
had
for
ever
cut
me
off
from
the
number
of
the
living
and
i
had
myself
sealed
down
the
stone
of
my
own
tomb
i
had
with
my
own
hand
bolted
the
gate
of
my
prison
i
went
to
the
window
the
sky
was
beautifully
blue
the
trees
had
donned
their
spring
robes
nature
seemed
to
be
making
parade
of
an
ironical
joy
the
place
was
filled
with
people
some
going
others
coming
young
beaux
and
young
beauties
were
sauntering
in
couples
toward
the
groves
and
gardens
merry
youths
passed
by
cheerily
trolling
refrains
of
drinking-songs--it
was
all
a
picture
of
vivacity
life
animation
gaiety
which
formed
a
bitter
contrast
with
my
mourning
and
my
solitude
on
the
steps
of
the
gate
sat
a
young
mother
playing
with
her
child
she
kissed
its
little
rosy
mouth
still
impearled
with
drops
of
milk
and
performed
in
order
to
amuse
it
a
thousand
divine
little
puerilities
such
as
only
mothers
know
how
to
invent
the
father
standing
at
a
little
distance
smiled
gently
upon
the
charming
group
and
with
folded
arms
seemed
to
hug
his
joy
to
his
heart
i
could
not
endure
that
spectacle
i
closed
the
window
with
violence
and
flung
myself
on
my
bed
my
heart
filled
with
frightful
hate
and
jealousy
and
gnawed
my
fingers
and
my
bedcovers
like
a
tiger
that
has
passed
ten
days
without
food
i
know
not
how
long
i
remained
in
this
condition
but
at
last
while
writhing
on
the
bed
in
a
fit
of
spasmodic
fury
i
suddenly
perceived
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
who
was
standing
erect
in
the
centre
of
the
room
watching
me
attentively
filled
with
shame
of
myself
i
let
my
head
fall
upon
my
breast
and
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
â€˜romuald
my
friend
something
very
extraordinary
is
transpiring
within
youâ€™
observed
sã©rapion
after
a
few
momentsâ€™
silence
â€˜your
conduct
is
altogether
inexplicable
you--always
so
quiet
so
pious
so
gentle--you
to
rage
in
your
cell
like
a
wild
beast
take
heed
brother--do
not
listen
to
the
suggestions
of
the
devil
the
evil
spirit
furious
that
you
have
consecrated
yourself
for
ever
to
the
lord
is
prowling
around
you
like
a
ravening
wolf
and
making
a
last
effort
to
obtain
possession
of
you
instead
of
allowing
yourself
to
be
conquered
my
dear
romuald
make
to
yourself
a
cuirass
of
prayers
a
buckler
of
mortifications
and
combat
the
enemy
like
a
valiant
man
you
will
then
assuredly
overcome
him
virtue
must
be
proved
by
temptation
and
gold
comes
forth
purer
from
the
hands
of
the
assayer
fear
not
never
allow
yourself
to
become
discouraged
the
most
watchful
and
steadfast
souls
are
at
moments
liable
to
such
temptation
pray
fast
meditate
and
the
evil
spirit
will
depart
from
youâ€™
the
words
of
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
restored
me
to
myself
and
i
became
a
little
more
calm
â€˜i
cameâ€™
he
continued
â€˜to
tell
you
that
you
have
been
appointed
to
the
curacy
of
c------
the
priest
who
had
charge
of
it
has
just
died
and
monseigneur
the
bishop
has
ordered
me
to
have
you
installed
there
at
once
be
ready
therefore
to
start
to-morrowâ€™
i
responded
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
and
the
abbã©
retired
i
opened
my
missal
and
commenced
reading
some
prayers
but
the
letters
became
confused
and
blurred
under
my
eyes
the
thread
of
the
ideas
entangled
itself
hopelessly
in
my
brain
and
the
volume
at
last
fell
from
my
hands
without
my
being
aware
of
it
to
leave
to-morrow
without
having
been
able
to
see
her
again
to
add
yet
another
barrier
to
the
many
already
interposed
between
us
to
lose
for
ever
all
hope
of
being
able
to
meet
her
except
indeed
through
a
miracle
even
to
write
to
her
alas
would
be
impossible
for
by
whom
could
i
dispatch
my
letter
with
my
sacred
character
of
priest
to
whom
could
i
dare
unbosom
myself
in
whom
could
i
confide
i
became
a
prey
to
the
bitterest
anxiety
then
suddenly
recurred
to
me
the
words
of
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
regarding
the
artifices
of
the
devil
and
the
strange
character
of
the
adventure
the
supernatural
beauty
of
clarimonde
the
phosphoric
light
of
her
eyes
the
burning
imprint
of
her
hand
the
agony
into
which
she
had
thrown
me
the
sudden
change
wrought
within
me
when
all
my
piety
vanished
in
a
single
instant--these
and
other
things
clearly
testified
to
the
work
of
the
evil
one
and
perhaps
that
satiny
hand
was
but
the
glove
which
concealed
his
claws
filled
with
terror
at
these
fancies
i
again
picked
up
the
missal
which
had
slipped
from
my
knees
and
fallen
upon
the
floor
and
once
more
gave
myself
up
to
prayer
next
morning
sã©rapion
came
to
take
me
away
two
mules
freighted
with
our
miserable
valises
awaited
us
at
the
gate
he
mounted
one
and
i
the
other
as
well
as
i
knew
how
as
we
passed
along
the
streets
of
the
city
i
gazed
attentively
at
all
the
windows
and
balconies
in
the
hope
of
seeing
clarimonde
but
it
was
yet
early
in
the
morning
and
the
city
had
hardly
opened
its
eyes
mine
sought
to
penetrate
the
blinds
and
window-curtains
of
all
the
palaces
before
which
we
were
passing
sã©rapion
doubtless
attributed
this
curiosity
to
my
admiration
of
the
architecture
for
he
slackened
the
pace
of
his
animal
in
order
to
give
me
time
to
look
around
me
at
last
we
passed
the
city
gates
and
commenced
to
mount
the
hill
beyond
when
we
arrived
at
its
summit
i
turned
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
place
where
clarimonde
dwelt
the
shadow
of
a
great
cloud
hung
over
all
the
city
the
contrasting
colours
of
its
blue
and
red
roofs
were
lost
in
the
uniform
half-tint
through
which
here
and
there
floated
upward
like
white
flakes
of
foam
the
smoke
of
freshly
kindled
fires
by
a
singular
optical
effect
one
edifice
which
surpassed
in
height
all
the
neighbouring
buildings
that
were
still
dimly
veiled
by
the
vapours
towered
up
fair
and
lustrous
with
the
gilding
of
a
solitary
beam
of
sunlight--although
actually
more
than
a
league
away
it
seemed
quite
near
the
smallest
details
of
its
architecture
were
plainly
distinguishable--the
turrets
the
platforms
the
window-casements
and
even
the
swallow-tailed
weather-vanes
â€˜what
is
that
palace
i
see
over
there
all
lighted
up
by
the
sunâ€™
i
asked
sã©rapion
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
having
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
replied
â€˜it
is
the
ancient
palace
which
the
prince
concini
has
given
to
the
courtesan
clarimonde
awful
things
are
done
thereâ€™
at
that
instant
i
know
not
yet
whether
it
was
a
reality
or
an
illusion
i
fancied
i
saw
gliding
along
the
terrace
a
shapely
white
figure
which
gleamed
for
a
moment
in
passing
and
as
quickly
vanished
it
was
clarimonde
oh
did
she
know
that
at
that
very
hour
all
feverish
and
restless--from
the
height
of
the
rugged
road
which
separated
me
from
her
and
which
alas
i
could
never
more
descend--i
was
directing
my
eyes
upon
the
palace
where
she
dwelt
and
which
a
mocking
beam
of
sunlight
seemed
to
bring
nigh
to
me
as
though
inviting
me
to
enter
therein
as
its
lord
undoubtedly
she
must
have
known
it
for
her
soul
was
too
sympathetically
united
with
mine
not
to
have
felt
its
least
emotional
thrill
and
that
subtle
sympathy
it
must
have
been
which
prompted
her
to
climb--although
clad
only
in
her
nightdress--to
the
summit
of
the
terrace
amid
the
icy
dews
of
the
morning
the
shadow
gained
the
palace
and
the
scene
became
to
the
eye
only
a
motionless
ocean
of
roofs
and
gables
amid
which
one
mountainous
undulation
was
distinctly
visible
sã©rapion
urged
his
mule
forward
my
own
at
once
followed
at
the
same
gait
and
a
sharp
angle
in
the
road
at
last
hid
the
city
of
s------
for
ever
from
my
eyes
as
i
was
destined
never
to
return
thither
at
the
close
of
a
weary
three-daysâ€™
journey
through
dismal
country
fields
we
caught
sight
of
the
cock
upon
the
steeple
of
the
church
which
i
was
to
take
charge
of
peeping
above
the
trees
and
after
having
followed
some
winding
roads
fringed
with
thatched
cottages
and
little
gardens
we
found
ourselves
in
front
of
the
faã§ade
which
certainly
possessed
few
features
of
magnificence
a
porch
ornamented
with
some
mouldings
and
two
or
three
pillars
rudely
hewn
from
sandstone
a
tiled
roof
with
counterforts
of
the
same
sandstone
as
the
pillars--that
was
all
to
the
left
lay
the
cemetery
overgrown
with
high
weeds
and
having
a
great
iron
cross
rising
up
in
its
centre
to
the
right
stood
the
presbytery
under
the
shadow
of
the
church
it
was
a
house
of
the
most
extreme
simplicity
and
frigid
cleanliness
we
entered
the
enclosure
a
few
chickens
were
picking
up
some
oats
scattered
upon
the
ground
accustomed
seemingly
to
the
black
habit
of
ecclesiastics
they
showed
no
fear
of
our
presence
and
scarcely
troubled
themselves
to
get
out
of
our
way
a
hoarse
wheezy
barking
fell
upon
our
ears
and
we
saw
an
aged
dog
running
toward
us
it
was
my
predecessorâ€™s
dog
he
had
dull
bleared
eyes
grizzled
hair
and
every
mark
of
the
greatest
age
to
which
a
dog
can
possibly
attain
i
patted
him
gently
and
he
proceeded
at
once
to
march
along
beside
me
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
unspeakable
a
very
old
woman
who
had
been
the
housekeeper
of
the
former
curã©
also
came
to
meet
us
and
after
having
invited
me
into
a
little
back
parlour
asked
whether
i
intended
to
retain
her
i
replied
that
i
would
take
care
of
her
and
the
dog
and
the
chickens
and
all
the
furniture
her
master
had
bequeathed
her
at
his
death
at
this
she
became
fairly
transported
with
joy
and
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
at
once
paid
her
the
price
which
she
asked
for
her
little
property
as
soon
as
my
installation
was
over
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
returned
to
the
seminary
i
was
therefore
left
alone
with
no
one
but
myself
to
look
to
for
aid
or
counsel
the
thought
of
clarimonde
again
began
to
haunt
me
and
in
spite
of
all
my
endeavours
to
banish
it
i
always
found
it
present
in
my
meditations
one
evening
while
promenading
in
my
little
garden
along
the
walks
bordered
with
box-plants
i
fancied
that
i
saw
through
the
elm-trees
the
figure
of
a
woman
who
followed
my
every
movement
and
that
i
beheld
two
sea-green
eyes
gleaming
through
the
foliage
but
it
was
only
an
illusion
and
on
going
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
garden
i
could
find
nothing
except
a
footprint
on
the
sanded
walk--a
footprint
so
small
that
it
seemed
to
have
been
made
by
the
foot
of
a
child
the
garden
was
enclosed
by
very
high
walls
i
searched
every
nook
and
corner
of
it
but
could
discover
no
one
there
i
have
never
succeeded
in
fully
accounting
for
this
circumstance
which
after
all
was
nothing
compared
with
the
strange
things
which
happened
to
me
afterward
for
a
whole
year
i
lived
thus
filling
all
the
duties
of
my
calling
with
the
most
scrupulous
exactitude
praying
and
fasting
exhorting
and
lending
ghostly
aid
to
the
sick
and
bestowing
alms
even
to
the
extent
of
frequently
depriving
myself
of
the
very
necessaries
of
life
but
i
felt
a
great
aridness
within
me
and
the
sources
of
grace
seemed
closed
against
me
i
never
found
that
happiness
which
should
spring
from
the
fulfilment
of
a
holy
mission
my
thoughts
were
far
away
and
the
words
of
clarimonde
were
ever
upon
my
lips
like
an
involuntary
refrain
oh
brother
meditate
well
on
this
through
having
but
once
lifted
my
eyes
to
look
upon
a
woman
through
one
fault
apparently
so
venial
i
have
for
years
remained
a
victim
to
the
most
miserable
agonies
and
the
happiness
of
my
life
has
been
destroyed
for
ever
i
will
not
longer
dwell
upon
those
defeats
or
on
those
inward
victories
invariably
followed
by
yet
more
terrible
falls
but
will
at
once
proceed
to
the
facts
of
my
story
one
night
my
door-bell
was
long
and
violently
rung
the
aged
housekeeper
arose
and
opened
to
the
stranger
and
the
figure
of
a
man
whose
complexion
was
deeply
bronzed
and
who
was
richly
clad
in
a
foreign
costume
with
a
poniard
at
his
girdle
appeared
under
the
rays
of
barbaraâ€™s
lantern
her
first
impulse
was
one
of
terror
but
the
stranger
reassured
her
and
stated
that
he
desired
to
see
me
at
once
on
matters
relating
to
my
holy
calling
barbara
invited
him
upstairs
where
i
was
on
the
point
of
retiring
the
stranger
told
me
that
his
mistress
a
very
noble
lady
was
lying
at
the
point
of
death
and
desired
to
see
a
priest
i
replied
that
i
was
prepared
to
follow
him
took
with
me
the
sacred
articles
necessary
for
extreme
unction
and
descended
in
all
haste
two
horses
black
as
the
night
itself
stood
without
the
gate
pawing
the
ground
with
impatience
and
veiling
their
chests
with
long
streams
of
smoky
vapour
exhaled
from
their
nostrils
he
held
the
stirrup
and
aided
me
to
mount
upon
one
then
merely
laying
his
hand
upon
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
he
vaulted
on
the
other
pressed
the
animalâ€™s
sides
with
his
knees
and
loosened
rein
the
horse
bounded
forward
with
the
velocity
of
an
arrow
mine
of
which
the
stranger
held
the
bridle
also
started
off
at
a
swift
gallop
keeping
up
with
his
companion
we
devoured
the
road
the
ground
flowed
backward
beneath
us
in
a
long
streaked
line
of
pale
gray
and
the
black
silhouettes
of
the
trees
seemed
fleeing
by
us
on
either
side
like
an
army
in
rout
we
passed
through
a
forest
so
profoundly
gloomy
that
i
felt
my
flesh
creep
in
the
chill
darkness
with
superstitious
fear
the
showers
of
bright
sparks
which
flew
from
the
stony
road
under
the
ironshod
feet
of
our
horses
remained
glowing
in
our
wake
like
a
fiery
trail
and
had
any
one
at
that
hour
of
the
night
beheld
us
both--my
guide
and
myself--he
must
have
taken
us
for
two
spectres
riding
upon
nightmares
witch-fires
ever
and
anon
flitted
across
the
road
before
us
and
the
night-birds
shrieked
fearsomely
in
the
depth
of
the
woods
beyond
where
we
beheld
at
intervals
glow
the
phosphorescent
eyes
of
wild
cats
the
manes
of
the
horses
became
more
and
more
dishevelled
the
sweat
streamed
over
their
flanks
and
their
breath
came
through
their
nostrils
hard
and
fast
but
when
he
found
them
slacking
pace
the
guide
reanimated
them
by
uttering
a
strange
gutteral
unearthly
cry
and
the
gallop
recommenced
with
fury
at
last
the
whirlwind
race
ceased
a
huge
black
mass
pierced
through
with
many
bright
points
of
light
suddenly
rose
before
us
the
hoofs
of
our
horses
echoed
louder
upon
a
strong
wooden
drawbridge
and
we
rode
under
a
great
vaulted
archway
which
darkly
yawned
between
two
enormous
towers
some
great
excitement
evidently
reigned
in
the
castle
servants
with
torches
were
crossing
the
courtyard
in
every
direction
and
above
lights
were
ascending
and
descending
from
landing
to
landing
i
obtained
a
confused
glimpse
of
vast
masses
of
architecture--columns
arcades
flights
of
steps
stairways--a
royal
voluptuousness
and
elfin
magnificence
of
construction
worthy
of
fairyland
a
negro
page--the
same
who
had
before
brought
me
the
tablet
from
clarimonde
and
whom
i
instantly
recognised--approached
to
aid
me
in
dismounting
and
the
major-domo
attired
in
black
velvet
with
a
gold
chain
about
his
neck
advanced
to
meet
me
supporting
himself
upon
an
ivory
cane
large
tears
were
falling
from
his
eyes
and
streaming
over
his
cheeks
and
white
beard
â€˜too
lateâ€™
he
cried
sorrowfully
shaking
his
venerable
head
â€˜too
late
sir
priest
but
if
you
have
not
been
able
to
save
the
soul
come
at
least
to
watch
by
the
poor
bodyâ€™
he
took
my
arm
and
conducted
me
to
the
death-chamber
i
wept
not
less
bitterly
than
he
for
i
had
learned
that
the
dead
one
was
none
other
than
that
clarimonde
whom
i
had
so
deeply
and
so
wildly
loved
a
prie-dieu
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
a
bluish
flame
flickering
in
a
bronze
patern
filled
all
the
room
with
a
wan
deceptive
light
here
and
there
bringing
out
in
the
darkness
at
intervals
some
projection
of
furniture
or
cornice
in
a
chiselled
urn
upon
the
table
there
was
a
faded
white
rose
whose
leaves--excepting
one
that
still
held--had
all
fallen
like
odorous
tears
to
the
foot
of
the
vase
a
broken
black
mask
a
fan
and
disguises
of
every
variety
which
were
lying
on
the
armchairs
bore
witness
that
death
had
entered
suddenly
and
unannounced
into
that
sumptuous
dwelling
without
daring
to
cast
my
eyes
upon
the
bed
i
knelt
down
and
commenced
to
repeat
the
psalms
for
the
dead
with
exceeding
fervour
thanking
god
that
he
had
placed
the
tomb
between
me
and
the
memory
of
this
woman
so
that
i
might
thereafter
be
able
to
utter
her
name
in
my
prayers
as
a
name
for
ever
sanctified
by
death
but
my
fervour
gradually
weakened
and
i
fell
insensibly
into
a
reverie
that
chamber
bore
no
semblance
to
a
chamber
of
death
in
lieu
of
the
fetid
and
cadaverous
odours
which
i
had
been
accustomed
to
breathe
during
such
funereal
vigils
a
languorous
vapour
of
oriental
perfume--i
know
not
what
amorous
odour
of
woman--softly
floated
through
the
tepid
air
that
pale
light
seemed
rather
a
twilight
gloom
contrived
for
voluptuous
pleasure
than
a
substitute
for
the
yellow-flickering
watch-tapers
which
shine
by
the
side
of
corpses
i
thought
upon
the
strange
destiny
which
enabled
me
to
meet
clarimonde
again
at
the
very
moment
when
she
was
lost
to
me
for
ever
and
a
sigh
of
regretful
anguish
escaped
from
my
breast
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
one
behind
me
had
also
sighed
and
i
turned
round
to
look
it
was
only
an
echo
but
in
that
moment
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
bed
of
death
which
they
had
till
then
avoided
the
red
damask
curtains
decorated
with
large
flowers
worked
in
embroidery
and
looped
up
with
gold
bullion
permitted
me
to
behold
the
fair
dead
lying
at
full
length
with
hands
joined
upon
her
bosom
she
was
covered
with
a
linen
wrapping
of
dazzling
whiteness
which
formed
a
strong
contrast
with
the
gloomy
purple
of
the
hangings
and
was
of
so
fine
a
texture
that
it
concealed
nothing
of
her
bodyâ€™s
charming
form
and
allowed
the
eye
to
follow
those
beautiful
outlines--undulating
like
the
neck
of
a
swan--which
even
death
had
not
robbed
of
their
supple
grace
she
seemed
an
alabaster
statue
executed
by
some
skilful
sculptor
to
place
upon
the
tomb
of
a
queen
or
rather
perhaps
like
a
slumbering
maiden
over
whom
the
silent
snow
had
woven
a
spotless
veil
i
could
no
longer
maintain
my
constrained
attitude
of
prayer
the
air
of
the
alcove
intoxicated
me
that
febrile
perfume
of
half-faded
roses
penetrated
my
very
brain
and
i
commenced
to
pace
restlessly
up
and
down
the
chamber
pausing
at
each
turn
before
the
bier
to
contemplate
the
graceful
corpse
lying
beneath
the
transparency
of
its
shroud
wild
fancies
came
thronging
to
my
brain
i
thought
to
myself
that
she
might
not
perhaps
be
really
dead
that
she
might
only
have
feigned
death
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
me
to
her
castle
and
then
declaring
her
love
at
one
time
i
even
thought
i
saw
her
foot
move
under
the
whiteness
of
the
coverings
and
slightly
disarrange
the
long
straight
folds
of
the
winding-sheet
and
then
i
asked
myself
â€˜is
this
indeed
clarimonde
what
proof
have
i
that
it
is
she
might
not
that
black
page
have
passed
into
the
service
of
some
other
lady
surely
i
must
be
going
mad
to
torture
and
afflict
myself
thusâ€™
but
my
heart
answered
with
a
fierce
throbbing
â€˜it
is
she
it
is
she
indeedâ€™
i
approached
the
bed
again
and
fixed
my
eyes
with
redoubled
attention
upon
the
object
of
my
incertitude
ah
must
i
confess
it
that
exquisite
perfection
of
bodily
form
although
purified
and
made
sacred
by
the
shadow
of
death
affected
me
more
voluptuously
than
it
should
have
done
and
that
repose
so
closely
resembled
slumber
that
one
might
well
have
mistaken
it
for
such
i
forgot
that
i
had
come
there
to
perform
a
funeral
ceremony
i
fancied
myself
a
young
bridegroom
entering
the
chamber
of
the
bride
who
all
modestly
hides
her
fair
face
and
through
coyness
seeks
to
keep
herself
wholly
veiled
heartbroken
with
grief
yet
wild
with
hope
shuddering
at
once
with
fear
and
pleasure
i
bent
over
her
and
grasped
the
corner
of
the
sheet
i
lifted
it
back
holding
my
breath
all
the
while
through
fear
of
waking
her
my
arteries
throbbed
with
such
violence
that
i
felt
them
hiss
through
my
temples
and
the
sweat
poured
from
my
forehead
in
streams
as
though
i
had
lifted
a
mighty
slab
of
marble
there
indeed
lay
clarimonde
even
as
i
had
seen
her
at
the
church
on
the
day
of
my
ordination
she
was
not
less
charming
than
then
with
her
death
seemed
but
a
last
coquetry
the
pallor
of
her
cheeks
the
less
brilliant
carnation
of
her
lips
her
long
eyelashes
lowered
and
relieving
their
dark
fringe
against
that
white
skin
lent
her
an
unspeakably
seductive
aspect
of
melancholy
chastity
and
mental
suffering
her
long
loose
hair
still
intertwined
with
some
little
blue
flowers
made
a
shining
pillow
for
her
head
and
veiled
the
nudity
of
her
shoulders
with
its
thick
ringlets
her
beautiful
hands
purer
more
diaphanous
than
the
host
were
crossed
on
her
bosom
in
an
attitude
of
pious
rest
and
silent
prayer
which
served
to
counteract
all
that
might
have
proven
otherwise
too
alluring--even
after
death--in
the
exquisite
roundness
and
ivory
polish
of
her
bare
arms
from
which
the
pearl
bracelets
had
not
yet
been
removed
i
remained
long
in
mute
contemplation
and
the
more
i
gazed
the
less
could
i
persuade
myself
that
life
had
really
abandoned
that
beautiful
body
for
ever
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
an
illusion
or
a
reflection
of
the
lamplight
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
blood
was
again
commencing
to
circulate
under
that
lifeless
pallor
although
she
remained
all
motionless
i
laid
my
hand
lightly
on
her
arm
it
was
cold
but
not
colder
than
her
hand
on
the
day
when
it
touched
mine
at
the
portals
of
the
church
i
resumed
my
position
bending
my
face
above
her
and
bathing
her
cheek
with
the
warm
dew
of
my
tears
ah
what
bitter
feelings
of
despair
and
helplessness
what
agonies
unutterable
did
i
endure
in
that
long
watch
vainly
did
i
wish
that
i
could
have
gathered
all
my
life
into
one
mass
that
i
might
give
it
all
to
her
and
breathe
into
her
chill
remains
the
flame
which
devoured
me
the
night
advanced
and
feeling
the
moment
of
eternal
separation
approach
i
could
not
deny
myself
the
last
sad
sweet
pleasure
of
imprinting
a
kiss
upon
the
dead
lips
of
her
who
had
been
my
only
love
oh
miracle
a
faint
breath
mingled
itself
with
my
breath
and
the
mouth
of
clarimonde
responded
to
the
passionate
pressure
of
mine
her
eyes
unclosed
and
lighted
up
with
something
of
their
former
brilliancy
she
uttered
a
long
sigh
and
uncrossing
her
arms
passed
them
around
my
neck
with
a
look
of
ineffable
delight
â€˜ah
it
is
thou
romualdâ€™
she
murmured
in
a
voice
languishingly
sweet
as
the
last
vibrations
of
a
harp
â€˜what
ailed
thee
dearest
i
waited
so
long
for
thee
that
i
am
dead
but
we
are
now
betrothed
i
can
see
thee
and
visit
thee
adieu
romuald
adieu
i
love
thee
that
is
all
i
wished
to
tell
thee
and
i
give
thee
back
the
life
which
thy
kiss
for
a
moment
recalled
we
shall
soon
meet
againâ€™
her
head
fell
back
but
her
arms
yet
encircled
me
as
though
to
retain
me
still
a
furious
whirlwind
suddenly
burst
in
the
window
and
entered
the
chamber
the
last
remaining
leaf
of
the
white
rose
for
a
moment
palpitated
at
the
extremity
of
the
stalk
like
a
butterflyâ€™s
wing
then
it
detached
itself
and
flew
forth
through
the
open
casement
bearing
with
it
the
soul
of
clarimonde
the
lamp
was
extinguished
and
i
fell
insensible
upon
the
bosom
of
the
beautiful
dead
when
i
came
to
myself
again
i
was
lying
on
the
bed
in
my
little
room
at
the
presbytery
and
the
old
dog
of
the
former
curã©
was
licking
my
hand
which
had
been
hanging
down
outside
of
the
covers
barbara
all
trembling
with
age
and
anxiety
was
busying
herself
about
the
room
opening
and
shutting
drawers
and
emptying
powders
into
glasses
on
seeing
me
open
my
eyes
the
old
woman
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
the
dog
yelped
and
wagged
his
tail
but
i
was
still
so
weak
that
i
could
not
speak
a
single
word
or
make
the
slightest
motion
afterward
i
learned
that
i
had
lain
thus
for
three
days
giving
no
evidence
of
life
beyond
the
faintest
respiration
those
three
days
do
not
reckon
in
my
life
nor
could
i
ever
imagine
whither
my
spirit
had
departed
during
those
three
days
i
have
no
recollection
of
aught
relating
to
them
barbara
told
me
that
the
same
coppery-complexioned
man
who
came
to
seek
me
on
the
night
of
my
departure
from
the
presbytery
had
brought
me
back
the
next
morning
in
a
close
litter
and
departed
immediately
afterward
when
i
became
able
to
collect
my
scattered
thoughts
i
reviewed
within
my
mind
all
the
circumstances
of
that
fateful
night
at
first
i
thought
i
had
been
the
victim
of
some
magical
illusion
but
ere
long
the
recollection
of
other
circumstances
real
and
palpable
in
themselves
came
to
forbid
that
supposition
i
could
not
believe
that
i
had
been
dreaming
since
barbara
as
well
as
myself
had
seen
the
strange
man
with
his
two
black
horses
and
described
with
exactness
every
detail
of
his
figure
and
apparel
nevertheless
it
appeared
that
none
knew
of
any
castle
in
the
neighbourhood
answering
to
the
description
of
that
in
which
i
had
again
found
clarimonde
one
morning
i
found
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
in
my
room
barbara
had
advised
him
that
i
was
ill
and
he
had
come
with
all
speed
to
see
me
although
this
haste
on
his
part
testified
to
an
affectionate
interest
in
me
yet
his
visit
did
not
cause
me
the
pleasure
which
it
should
have
done
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
had
something
penetrating
and
inquisitorial
in
his
gaze
which
made
me
feel
very
ill
at
ease
his
presence
filled
me
with
embarrassment
and
a
sense
of
guilt
at
the
first
glance
he
divined
my
interior
trouble
and
i
hated
him
for
his
clairvoyance
while
he
inquired
after
my
health
in
hypocritically
honeyed
accents
he
constantly
kept
his
two
great
yellow
lion-eyes
fixed
upon
me
and
plunged
his
look
into
my
soul
like
a
sounding-lead
then
he
asked
me
how
i
directed
my
parish
if
i
was
happy
in
it
how
i
passed
the
leisure
hours
allowed
me
in
the
intervals
of
pastoral
duty
whether
i
had
become
acquainted
with
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
what
was
my
favourite
reading
and
a
thousand
other
such
questions
i
answered
these
inquiries
as
briefly
as
possible
and
he
without
ever
waiting
for
my
answers
passed
rapidly
from
one
subject
of
query
to
another
that
conversation
had
evidently
no
connection
with
what
he
actually
wished
to
say
at
last
without
any
premonition
but
as
though
repeating
a
piece
of
news
which
he
had
recalled
on
the
instant
and
feared
might
otherwise
be
forgotten
subsequently
he
suddenly
said
in
a
clear
vibrant
voice
which
rang
in
my
ears
like
the
trumpets
of
the
last
judgment
â€˜the
great
courtesan
clarimonde
died
a
few
days
ago
at
the
close
of
an
orgie
which
lasted
eight
days
and
eight
nights
it
was
something
infernally
splendid
the
abominations
of
the
banquets
of
belshazzar
and
cleopatra
were
re-enacted
there
good
god
what
age
are
we
living
in
the
guests
were
served
by
swarthy
slaves
who
spoke
an
unknown
tongue
and
who
seemed
to
me
to
be
veritable
demons
the
livery
of
the
very
least
among
them
would
have
served
for
the
gala-dress
of
an
emperor
there
have
always
been
very
strange
stories
told
of
this
clarimonde
and
all
her
lovers
came
to
a
violent
or
miserable
end
they
used
to
say
that
she
was
a
ghoul
a
female
vampire
but
i
believe
she
was
none
other
than
beelzebub
himselfâ€™
he
ceased
to
speak
and
commenced
to
regard
me
more
attentively
than
ever
as
though
to
observe
the
effect
of
his
words
on
me
i
could
not
refrain
from
starting
when
i
heard
him
utter
the
name
of
clarimonde
and
this
news
of
her
death
in
addition
to
the
pain
it
caused
me
by
reason
of
its
coincidence
with
the
nocturnal
scenes
i
had
witnessed
filled
me
with
an
agony
and
terror
which
my
face
betrayed
despite
my
utmost
endeavours
to
appear
composed
sã©rapion
fixed
an
anxious
and
severe
look
upon
me
and
then
observed
â€˜my
son
i
must
warn
you
that
you
are
standing
with
foot
raised
upon
the
brink
of
an
abyss
take
heed
lest
you
fall
therein
satanâ€™s
claws
are
long
and
tombs
are
not
always
true
to
their
trust
the
tombstone
of
clarimonde
should
be
sealed
down
with
a
triple
seal
for
if
report
be
true
it
is
not
the
first
time
she
has
died
may
god
watch
over
you
romualdâ€™
and
with
these
words
the
abbã©
walked
slowly
to
the
door
i
did
not
see
him
again
at
that
time
for
he
left
for
s------
almost
immediately
i
became
completely
restored
to
health
and
resumed
my
accustomed
duties
the
memory
of
clarimonde
and
the
words
of
the
old
abbã©
were
constantly
in
my
mind
nevertheless
no
extraordinary
event
had
occurred
to
verify
the
funereal
predictions
of
sã©rapion
and
i
had
commenced
to
believe
that
his
fears
and
my
own
terrors
were
over-exaggerated
when
one
night
i
had
a
strange
dream
i
had
hardly
fallen
asleep
when
i
heard
my
bed-curtains
drawn
apart
as
their
rings
slided
back
upon
the
curtain
rod
with
a
sharp
sound
i
rose
up
quickly
upon
my
elbow
and
beheld
the
shadow
of
a
woman
standing
erect
before
me
i
recognised
clarimonde
immediately
she
bore
in
her
hand
a
little
lamp
shaped
like
those
which
are
placed
in
tombs
and
its
light
lent
her
fingers
a
rosy
transparency
which
extended
itself
by
lessening
degrees
even
to
the
opaque
and
milky
whiteness
of
her
bare
arm
her
only
garment
was
the
linen
winding-sheet
which
had
shrouded
her
when
lying
upon
the
bed
of
death
she
sought
to
gather
its
folds
over
her
bosom
as
though
ashamed
of
being
so
scantily
clad
but
her
little
hand
was
not
equal
to
the
task
she
was
so
white
that
the
colour
of
the
drapery
blended
with
that
of
her
flesh
under
the
pallid
rays
of
the
lamp
enveloped
with
this
subtle
tissue
which
betrayed
all
the
contour
of
her
body
she
seemed
rather
the
marble
statue
of
some
fair
antique
bather
than
a
woman
endowed
with
life
but
dead
or
living
statue
or
woman
shadow
or
body
her
beauty
was
still
the
same
only
that
the
green
light
of
her
eyes
was
less
brilliant
and
her
mouth
once
so
warmly
crimson
was
only
tinted
with
a
faint
tender
rosiness
like
that
of
her
cheeks
the
little
blue
flowers
which
i
had
noticed
entwined
in
her
hair
were
withered
and
dry
and
had
lost
nearly
all
their
leaves
but
this
did
not
prevent
her
from
being
charming--so
charming
that
notwithstanding
the
strange
character
of
the
adventure
and
the
unexplainable
manner
in
which
she
had
entered
my
room
i
felt
not
even
for
a
moment
the
least
fear
she
placed
the
lamp
on
the
table
and
seated
herself
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
then
bending
toward
me
she
said
in
that
voice
at
once
silvery
clear
and
yet
velvety
in
its
sweet
softness
such
as
i
never
heard
from
any
lips
save
hers
â€˜i
have
kept
thee
long
in
waiting
dear
romuald
and
it
must
have
seemed
to
thee
that
i
had
forgotten
thee
but
i
come
from
afar
off
very
far
off
and
from
a
land
whence
no
other
has
ever
yet
returned
there
is
neither
sun
nor
moon
in
that
land
whence
i
come
all
is
but
space
and
shadow
there
is
neither
road
nor
pathway
no
earth
for
the
foot
no
air
for
the
wing
and
nevertheless
behold
me
here
for
love
is
stronger
than
death
and
must
conquer
him
in
the
end
oh
what
sad
faces
and
fearful
things
i
have
seen
on
my
way
hither
what
difficulty
my
soul
returned
to
earth
through
the
power
of
will
alone
has
had
in
finding
its
body
and
reinstating
itself
therein
what
terrible
efforts
i
had
to
make
ere
i
could
lift
the
ponderous
slab
with
which
they
had
covered
me
see
the
palms
of
my
poor
hands
are
all
bruised
kiss
them
sweet
love
that
they
may
be
healedâ€™
she
laid
the
cold
palms
of
her
hands
upon
ray
mouth
one
after
the
other
i
kissed
them
indeed
many
times
and
she
the
while
watched
me
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
affection
i
confess
to
my
shame
that
i
had
entirely
forgotten
the
advice
of
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
and
the
sacred
office
wherewith
i
had
been
invested
i
had
fallen
without
resistance
and
at
the
first
assault
i
had
not
even
made
the
least
effort
to
repel
the
tempter
the
fresh
coolness
of
clarimondeâ€™s
skin
penetrated
my
own
and
i
felt
voluptuous
tremors
pass
over
my
whole
body
poor
child
in
spite
of
all
i
saw
afterward
i
can
hardly
yet
believe
she
was
a
demon
at
least
she
had
no
appearance
of
being
such
and
never
did
satan
so
skilfully
conceal
his
claws
and
horns
she
had
drawn
her
feet
up
beneath
her
and
squatted
down
on
the
edge
of
the
couch
in
an
attitude
full
of
negligent
coquetry
from
time
to
time
she
passed
her
little
hand
through
my
hair
and
twisted
it
into
curls
as
though
trying
how
a
new
style
of
wearing
it
would
become
my
face
i
abandoned
myself
to
her
hands
with
the
most
guilty
pleasure
while
she
accompanied
her
gentle
play
with
the
prettiest
prattle
the
most
remarkable
fact
was
that
i
felt
no
astonishment
whatever
at
so
extraordinary
ah
adventure
and
as
in
dreams
one
finds
no
difficulty
in
accepting
the
most
fantastic
events
as
simple
facts
so
all
these
circumstances
seemed
to
me
perfectly
natural
in
themselves
â€˜i
loved
thee
long
ere
i
saw
thee
dear
romuald
and
sought
thee
everywhere
thou
wast
my
dream
and
i
first
saw
thee
in
the
church
at
the
fatal
moment
i
said
at
once
â€œit
is
heâ€
i
gave
thee
a
look
into
which
i
threw
all
the
love
i
ever
had
all
the
love
i
now
have
all
the
love
i
shall
ever
have
for
thee--a
look
that
would
have
damned
a
cardinal
or
brought
a
king
to
his
knees
at
my
feet
in
view
of
all
his
court
thou
remainedst
unmoved
preferring
thy
god
to
me
â€˜ah
how
jealous
i
am
of
that
god
whom
thou
didst
love
and
still
lovest
more
than
me
â€˜woe
is
me
unhappy
one
that
i
am
i
can
never
have
thy
heart
all
to
myself
i
whom
thou
didst
recall
to
life
with
a
kiss--dead
clarimonde
who
for
thy
sake
bursts
asunder
the
gates
of
the
tomb
and
comes
to
consecrate
to
thee
a
life
which
she
has
resumed
only
to
make
thee
happyâ€™
all
her
words
were
accompanied
with
the
most
impassioned
caresses
which
bewildered
my
sense
and
my
reason
to
such
an
extent
that
i
did
not
fear
to
utter
a
frightful
blasphemy
for
the
sake
of
consoling
her
and
to
declare
that
i
loved
her
as
much
as
god
her
eyes
rekindled
and
shone
like
chrysoprases
â€˜in
truth--in
very
truth--as
much
as
godâ€™
she
cried
flinging
her
beautiful
arms
around
me
â€˜since
it
is
so
thou
wilt
come
with
me
thou
wilt
follow
me
whithersoever
i
desire
thou
wilt
cast
away
thy
ugly
black
habit
thou
shalt
be
the
proudest
and
most
envied
of
cavaliers
thou
shalt
be
my
lover
to
be
the
acknowledged
lover
of
clarimonde
who
has
refused
even
a
pope
that
will
be
something
to
feel
proud
of
ah
the
fair
unspeakably
happy
existence
the
beautiful
golden
life
we
shall
live
together
and
when
shall
we
depart
my
fair
sirâ€™
â€˜to-morrow
to-morrowâ€™
i
cried
in
my
delirium
â€˜to-morrow
then
so
let
it
beâ€™
she
answered
â€˜in
the
meanwhile
i
shall
have
opportunity
to
change
my
toilet
for
this
is
a
little
too
light
and
in
nowise
suited
for
a
voyage
i
must
also
forthwith
notify
all
my
friends
who
believe
me
dead
and
mourn
for
me
as
deeply
as
they
are
capable
of
doing
the
money
the
dresses
the
carriages--all
will
be
ready
i
shall
call
for
thee
at
this
same
hour
adieu
dear
heartâ€™
and
she
lightly
touched
my
forehead
with
her
lips
the
lamp
went
out
the
curtains
closed
again
and
all
became
dark
a
leaden
dreamless
sleep
fell
on
me
and
held
me
unconscious
until
the
morning
following
i
awoke
later
than
usual
and
the
recollection
of
this
singular
adventure
troubled
me
during
the
whole
day
i
finally
persuaded
myself
that
it
was
a
mere
vapour
of
my
heated
imagination
nevertheless
its
sensations
had
been
so
vivid
that
it
was
difficult
to
persuade
myself
that
they
were
not
real
and
it
was
not
without
some
presentiment
of
what
was
going
to
happen
that
i
got
into
bed
at
last
after
having
prayed
god
to
drive
far
from
me
all
thoughts
of
evil
and
to
protect
the
chastity
of
my
slumber
i
soon
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
my
dream
was
continued
the
curtains
again
parted
and
i
beheld
clarimonde
not
as
on
the
former
occasion
pale
in
her
pale
winding-sheet
with
the
violets
of
death
upon
her
cheeks
but
gay
sprightly
jaunty
in
a
superb
travelling-dress
of
green
velvet
trimmed
with
gold
lace
and
looped
up
on
either
side
to
allow
a
glimpse
of
satin
petticoat
her
blond
hair
escaped
in
thick
ringlets
from
beneath
a
broad
black
felt
hat
decorated
with
white
feathers
whimsically
twisted
into
various
shapes
in
one
hand
she
held
a
little
riding-whip
terminated
by
a
golden
whistle
she
tapped
me
lightly
with
it
and
exclaimed
â€˜well
my
fine
sleeper
is
this
the
way
you
make
your
preparations
i
thought
i
would
find
you
up
and
dressed
arise
quickly
we
have
no
time
to
loseâ€™
i
leaped
out
of
bed
at
once
â€˜come
dress
yourself
and
let
us
goâ€™
she
continued
pointing
to
a
little
package
she
had
brought
with
her
â€˜the
horses
are
becoming
impatient
of
delay
and
champing
their
bits
at
the
door
we
ought
to
have
been
by
this
time
at
least
ten
leagues
distant
from
hereâ€™
i
dressed
myself
hurriedly
and
she
handed
me
the
articles
of
apparel
herself
one
by
one
bursting
into
laughter
from
time
to
time
at
my
awkwardness
as
she
explained
to
me
the
use
of
a
garment
when
i
had
made
a
mistake
she
hurriedly
arranged
my
hair
and
this
done
held
up
before
me
a
little
pocket-mirror
of
venetian
crystal
rimmed
with
silver
filigree-work
and
playfully
asked
â€˜how
dost
find
thyself
now
wilt
engage
me
for
thy
valet
de
chambreâ€™
i
was
no
longer
the
same
person
and
i
could
not
even
recognise
myself
i
resembled
my
former
self
no
more
than
a
finished
statue
resembles
a
block
of
stone
my
old
face
seemed
but
a
coarse
daub
of
the
one
reflected
in
the
mirror
i
was
handsome
and
my
vanity
was
sensibly
tickled
by
the
metamorphosis
that
elegant
apparel
that
richly
embroidered
vest
had
made
of
me
a
totally
different
personage
and
i
marvelled
at
the
power
of
transformation
owned
by
a
few
yards
of
cloth
cut
after
a
certain
pattern
the
spirit
of
my
costume
penetrated
my
very
skin
and
within
ten
minutes
more
i
had
become
something
of
a
coxcomb
in
order
to
feel
more
at
ease
in
my
new
attire
i
took
several
turns
up
and
down
the
room
clari-monde
watched
me
with
an
air
of
maternal
pleasure
and
appeared
well
satisfied
with
her
work
â€˜come
enough
of
this
childâ€™s
play
let
us
start
romuald
dear
we
have
far
to
go
and
we
may
not
get
there
in
timeâ€™
she
took
my
hand
and
led
me
forth
all
the
doors
opened
before
her
at
a
touch
and
we
passed
by
the
dog
without
awaking
him
at
the
gate
we
found
margheritone
waiting
the
same
swarthy
groom
who
had
once
before
been
my-escort
he
held
the
bridles
of
three
horses
all
black
like
those
which
bore
us
to
the
castle--one
for
me
one
for
him
one
for
clarimonde
those
horses
must
have
been
spanish
genets
born
of
mares
fecundated
by
a
zephyr
for
they
were
fleet
as
the
wind
itself
and
the
moon
which
had
just
risen
at
our
departure
to
light
us
on
the
way
rolled
over
the
sky
like
a
wheel
detached
from
her
own
chariot
we
beheld
her
on
the
right
leaping
from
tree
to
tree
and
putting
herself
out
of
breath
in
the
effort
to
keep
up
with
us
soon
we
came
upon
a
level
plain
where
hard
by
a
clump
of
trees
a
carriage
with
four
vigorous
horses
awaited
us
we
entered
it
and
the
postillions
urged
their
animals
into
a
mad
gallop
i
had
one
arm
around
clarimondeâ€™s
waist
and
one
of
her
hands
clasped
in
mine
her
head
leaned
upon
my
shoulder
and
i
felt
her
bosom
half
bare
lightly
pressing
against
my
arm
i
had
never
known
such
intense
happiness
in
that
hour
i
had
forgotten
everything
and
i
no
more
remembered
having
ever
been
a
priest
than
i
remembered
what
i
had
been
doing
in
my
motherâ€™s
womb
so
great
was
the
fascination
which
the
evil
spirit
exerted
upon
me
from
that
night
my
nature
seemed
in
some
sort
to
have
become
halved
and
there
were
two
men
within
me
neither
of
whom
knew
the
other
at
one
moment
i
believed
myself
a
priest
who
dreamed
nightly
that
he
was
a
gentleman
at
another
that
i
was
a
gentleman
who
dreamed
he
was
a
priest
i
could
no
longer
distinguish
the
dream
from
the
reality
nor
could
i
discover
where
the
reality
began
or
where
ended
the
dream
the
exquisite
young
lord
and
libertine
railed
at
the
priest
the
priest
loathed
the
dissolute
habits
of
the
young
lord
two
spirals
entangled
and
confounded
the
one
with
the
other
yet
never
touching
would
afford
a
fair
representation
of
this
bicephalic
life
which
i
lived
despite
the
strange
character
of
my
condition
i
do
not
believe
that
i
ever
inclined
even
for
a
moment
to
madness
i
always
retained
with
extreme
vividness
all
the
perceptions
of
my
two
lives
only
there
was
one
absurd
fact
which
i
could
not
explain
to
myself--namely
that
the
consciousness
of
the
same
individuality
existed
in
two
men
so
opposite
in
character
it
was
an
anomaly
for
which
i
could
not
account--whether
i
believed
myself
to
be
the
curã©
of
the
little
village
of
c------
or
il
signor
romualdo
the
titled
lover
of
clarimonde
be
that
as
it
may
i
lived
at
least
i
believed
that
i
lived
in
venice
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
rightly
how
much
of
illusion
and
how
much
of
reality
there
was
in
this
fantastic
adventure
we
dwelt
in
a
great
palace
on
the
canaleio
filled
with
frescoes
and
statues
and
containing
two
titians
in
the
noblest
style
of
the
great
master
which
were
hung
in
clarimondeâ€™s
chamber
it
was
a
palace
well
worthy
of
a
king
we
had
each
our
gondola
our
barcarolli
in
family
livery
our
music
hall
and
our
special
poet
clarimonde
always
lived
upon
a
magnificent
scale
there
was
something
of
cleopatra
in
her
nature
as
for
me
i
had
the
retinue
of
a
princeâ€™s
son
and
i
was
regarded
with
as
much
reverential
respect
as
though
i
had
been
of
the
family
of
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
or
the
four
evangelists
of
the
most
serene
republic
i
would
not
have
turned
aside
to
allow
even
the
doge
to
pass
and
i
do
not
believe
that
since
satan
fell
from
heaven
any
creature
was
ever
prouder
or
more
insolent
than
i
i
went
to
the
ridotto
and
played
with
a
luck
which
seemed
absolutely
infernal
i
received
the
best
of
all
society--the
sons
of
ruined
families
women
of
the
theatre
shrewd
knaves
parasites
hectoring
swashbucklers
but
notwithstanding
the
dissipation
of
such
a
life
i
always
remained
faithful
to
clarimonde
i
loved
her
wildly
she
would
have
excited
satiety
itself
and
chained
inconstancy
to
have
clarimonde
was
to
have
twenty
mistresses
ay
to
possess
all
women
so
mobile
so
varied
of
aspect
so
fresh
in
new
charms
was
she
all
in
herself--a
very
chameleon
of
a
woman
in
sooth
she
made
you
commit
with
her
the
infidelity
you
would
have
committed
with
another
by
donning
to
perfection
the
character
the
attraction
the
style
of
beauty
of
the
woman
who
appeared
to
please
you
she
returned
my
love
a
hundred-fold
and
it
was
in
vain
that
the
young
patricians
and
even
the
ancients
of
the
council
of
ten
made
her
the
most
magnificent
proposals
a
foscari
even
went
so
far
as
to
offer
to
espouse
her
she
rejected
all
his
overtures
of
gold
she
had
enough
she
wished
no
longer
for
anything
but
love--a
love
youthful
pure
evoked
by
herself
and
which
should
be
a
first
and
last
passion
i
would
have
been
perfectly
happy
but
for
a
cursed
nightmare
which
recurred
every
night
and
in
which
i
believed
myself
to
be
a
poor
village
curã©
practising
mortification
and
penance
for
my
excesses
during
the
day
reassured
by
my
constant
association
with
her
i
never
thought
further
of
the
strange
manner
in
which
i
had
become
acquainted
with
clarimonde
but
the
words
of
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
concerning
her
recurred
often
to
my
memory
and
never
ceased
to
cause
me
uneasiness
for
some
time
the
health
of
clarimonde
had
not
been
so
good
as
usual
her
complexion
grew
paler
day
by
day
the
physicians
who
were
summoned
could
not
comprehend
the
nature
of
her
malady
and
knew
not
how
to
treat
it
they
all
prescribed
some
insignificant
remedies
and
never
called
a
second
time
her
paleness
nevertheless
visibly
increased
and
she
became
colder
and
colder
until
she
seemed
almost
as
white
and
dead
as
upon
that
memorable
night
in
the
unknown
castle
i
grieved
with
anguish
unspeakable
to
behold
her
thus
slowly
perishing
and
she
touched
by
my
agony
smiled
upon
me
sweetly
and
sadly
with
the
fateful
smile
of
those
who
feel
that
they
must
die
one
morning
i
was
seated
at
her
bedside
and
breakfasting
from
a
little
table
placed
close
at
hand
so
that
i
might
not
be
obliged
to
leave
her
for
a
single
instant
in
the
act
of
cutting
some
fruit
i
accidentally
inflicted
rather
a
deep
gash
on
my
finger
the
blood
immediately
gushed
forth
in
a
little
purple
jet
and
a
few
drops
spurted
upon
clarimonde
her
eyes
flashed
her
face
suddenly
assumed
an
expression
of
savage
and
ferocious
joy
such
as
i
had
never
before
observed
in
her
she
leaped
out
of
her
bed
with
animal
agility--the
agility
as
it
were
of
an
ape
or
a
cat--and
sprang
upon
my
wound
which
she
commenced
to
suck
with
an
air
of
unutterable
pleasure
she
swallowed
the
blood
in
little
mouthfuls
slowly
and
carefully
like
a
connoisseur
tasting
a
wine
from
xeres
or
syracuse
gradually
her
eyelids
half
closed
and
the
pupils
of
her
green
eyes
became
oblong
instead
of
round
from
time
to
time
she
paused
in
order
to
kiss
my
hand
then
she
would
recommence
to
press
her
lips
to
the
lips
of
the
wound
in
order
to
coax
forth
a
few
more
ruddy
drops
when
she
found
that
the
blood
would
no
longer
come
she
arose
with
eyes
liquid
and
brilliant
rosier
than
a
may
dawn
her
face
full
and
fresh
her
hand
warm
and
moist--in
fine
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
in
the
most
perfect
health
â€˜i
shall
not
die
i
shall
not
dieâ€™
she
cried
clinging
to
my
neck
half
mad
with
joy
â€˜i
can
love
thee
yet
for
a
long
time
my
life
is
thine
and
all
that
is
of
me
comes
from
thee
a
few
drops
of
thy
rich
and
noble
blood
more
precious
and
more
potent
than
all
the
elixirs
of
the
earth
have
given
me
back
lifeâ€™
this
scene
long
haunted
my
memory
and
inspired
me
with
strange
doubts
in
regard
to
clarimonde
and
the
same
evening
when
slumber
had
transported
me
to
my
presbytery
i
beheld
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
graver
and
more
anxious
of
aspect
than
ever
he
gazed
attentively
at
me
and
sorrowfully
exclaimed
â€˜not
content
with
losing
your
soul
you
now
desire
also
to
lose
your
body
wretched
young
man
into
how
terrible
a
plight
have
you
fallenâ€™
the
tone
in
which
he
uttered
these
words
powerfully
affected
me
but
in
spite
of
its
vividness
even
that
impression
was
soon
dissipated
and
a
thousand
other
cares
erased
it
from
my
mind
at
last
one
evening
while
looking
into
a
mirror
whose
traitorous
position
she
had
not
taken
into
account
i
saw
clarimonde
in
the
act
of
emptying
a
powder
into
the
cup
of
spiced
wine
which
she
had
long
been
in
the
habit
of
preparing
after
our
repasts
i
took
the
cup
feigned
to
carry
it
to
my
lips
and
then
placed
it
on
the
nearest
article
of
furniture
as
though
intending
to
finish
it
at
my
leisure
taking
advantage
of
a
moment
when
the
fair
oneâ€™s
back
was
turned
i
threw
the
contents
under
the
table
after
which
i
retired
to
my
chamber
and
went
to
bed
fully
resolved
not
to
sleep
but
to
watch
and
discover
what
should
come
of
all
this
mystery
i
did
not
have
to
wait
long
clarimonde
entered
in
her
nightdress
and
having
removed
her
apparel
crept
into
bed
and
lay
down
beside
me
when
she
felt
assured
that
i
was
asleep
she
bared
my
arm
and
drawing
a
gold
pin
from
her
hair
commenced
to
murmur
in
a
low
voice
â€˜one
drop
only
one
drop
one
ruby
at
the
end
of
my
needle
since
thou
lovest
me
yet
i
must
not
die
ah
poor
love
his
beautiful
blood
so
brightly
purple
i
must
drink
it
sleep
my
only
treasure
sleep
my
god
my
child
i
will
do
thee
no
harm
i
will
only
take
of
thy
life
what
i
must
to
keep
my
own
from
being
for
ever
extinguished
but
that
i
love
thee
so
much
i
could
well
resolve
to
have
other
lovers
whose
veins
i
could
drain
but
since
i
have
known
thee
all
other
men
have
become
hateful
to
me
ah
the
beautiful
arm
how
round
it
is
how
white
it
is
how
shall
i
ever
dare
to
prick
this
pretty
blue
veinâ€™
and
while
thus
murmuring
to
herself
she
wept
and
i
felt
her
tears
raining
on
my
arm
as
she
clasped
it
with
her
hands
at
last
she
took
the
resolve
slightly
punctured
me
with
her
pin
and
commenced
to
suck
up
the
blood
which
oozed
from
the
place
although
she
swallowed
only
a
few
drops
the
fear
of
weakening
me
soon
seized
her
and
she
carefully
tied
a
little
band
around
my
arm
afterward
rubbing
the
wound
with
an
unguent
which
immediately
cicatrised
it
further
doubts
were
impossible
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
was
right
notwithstanding
this
positive
knowledge
however
i
could
not
cease
to
love
clarimonde
and
i
would
gladly
of
my
own
accord
have
given
her
all
the
blood
she
required
to
sustain
her
factitious
life
moreover
i
felt
but
little
fear
of
her
the
woman
seemed
to
plead
with
me
for
the
vampire
and
what
i
had
already
heard
and
seen
sufficed
to
reassure
me
completely
in
those
days
i
had
plenteous
veins
which
would
not
have
been
so
easily
exhausted
as
at
present
and
i
would
not
have
thought
of
bargaining
for
my
blood
drop
by
drop
i
would
rather
have
opened
myself
the
veins
of
my
arm
and
said
to
her
â€˜drink
and
may
my
love
infiltrate
itself
throughout
thy
body
together
with
my
bloodâ€™
i
carefully
avoided
ever
making
the
least
reference
to
the
narcotic
drink
she
had
prepared
for
me
or
to
the
incident
of
the
pin
and
we
lived
in
the
most
perfect
harmony
yet
my
priestly
scruples
commenced
to
torment
me
more
than
ever
and
i
was
at
a
loss
to
imagine
what
new
penance
i
could
invent
in
order
to
mortify
and
subdue
my
flesh
although
these
visions
were
involuntary
and
though
i
did
not
actually
participate
in
anything
relating
to
them
i
could
not
dare
to
touch
the
body
of
christ
with
hands
so
impure
and
a
mind
defiled
by
such
debauches
whether
real
or
imaginary
in
the
effort
to
avoid
falling
under
the
influence
of
these
wearisome
hallucinations
i
strove
to
prevent
myself
from
being
overcome
by
sleep
i
held
my
eyelids
open
with
my
fingers
and
stood
for
hours
together
leaning
upright
against
the
wall
fighting
sleep
with
all
my
might
but
the
dust
of
drowsiness
invariably
gathered
upon
my
eyes
at
last
and
finding
all
resistance
useless
i
would
have
to
let
my
arms
fall
in
the
extremity
of
despairing
weariness
and
the
current
of
slumber
would
again
bear
me
away
to
the
perfidious
shores
sã©rapion
addressed
me
with
the
most
vehement
exhortations
severely
reproaching
me
for
my
softness
and
want
of
fervour
finally
one
day
when
i
was
more
wretched
than
usual
he
said
to
me
â€˜there
is
but
one
way
by
which
you
can
obtain
relief
from
this
continual
torment
and
though
it
is
an
extreme
measure
it
must
be
made
use
of
violent
diseases
require
violent
remedies
i
know
where
clarimonde
is
buried
it
is
necessary
that
we
shall
disinter
her
remains
and
that
you
shall
behold
in
how
pitiable
a
state
the
object
of
your
love
is
then
you
will
no
longer
be
tempted
to
lose
your
soul
for
the
sake
of
an
unclean
corpse
devoured
by
worms
and
ready
to
crumble
into
dust
that
will
assuredly
restore
you
to
yourselfâ€™
for
my
part
i
was
so
tired
of
this
double
life
that
i
at
once
consented
desiring
to
ascertain
beyond
a
doubt
whether
a
priest
or
a
gentleman
had
been
the
victim
of
delusion
i
had
become
fully
resolved
either
to
kill
one
of
the
two
men
within
me
for
the
benefit
of
the
other
or
else
to
kill
both
for
so
terrible
an
existence
could
not
last
long
and
be
endured
the
abbã©
sã©rapion
provided
himself
with
a
mattock
a
lever
and
a
lantern
and
at
midnight
we
wended
our
way
to
the
cemetery
of
------
the
location
and
place
of
which
were
perfectly
familiar
to
him
after
having
directed
the
rays
of
the
dark
lantern
upon
the
inscriptions
of
several
tombs
we
came
at
last
upon
a
great
slab
half
concealed
by
huge
weeds
and
devoured
by
mosses
and
parasitic
plants
whereupon
we
deciphered
the
opening
lines
of
the
epitaph
here
lies
clarimonde
who
was
famed
in
her
life-time
as
the
fairest
of
women

ici
gã®t
clarimonde
qui
fut
de
son
vivant
la
plus
belle
du
monde
the
broken
beauty
of
the
lines
is
unavoidably
lost
in
the
translation
â€˜it
is
here
without
a
doubtâ€™
muttered
sã©rapion
and
placing
his
lantern
on
the
ground
he
forced
the
point
of
the
lever
under
the
edge
of
the
stone
and
commenced
to
raise
it
the
stone
yielded
and
he
proceeded
to
work
with
the
mattock
darker
and
more
silent
than
the
night
itself
i
stood
by
and
watched
him
do
it
while
he
bending
over
his
dismal
toil
streamed
with
sweat
panted
and
his
hard-coming
breath
seemed
to
have
the
harsh
tone
of
a
death
rattle
it
was
a
weird
scene
and
had
any
persons
from
without
beheld
us
they
would
assuredly
have
taken
us
rather
for
profane
wretches
and
shroud-stealers
than
for
priests
of
god
there
was
something
grim
and
fierce
in
sã©rapionâ€™s
zeal
which
lent
him
the
air
of
a
demon
rather
than
of
an
apostle
or
an
angel
and
his
great
aquiline
face
with
all
its
stern
features
brought
out
in
strong
relief
by
the
lantern-light
had
something
fearsome
in
it
which
enhanced
the
unpleasant
fancy
i
felt
an
icy
sweat
come
out
upon
my
forehead
in
huge
beads
and
my
hair
stood
up
with
a
hideous
fear
within
the
depths
of
my
own
heart
i
felt
that
the
act
of
the
austere
sã©rapion
was
an
abominable
sacrilege
and
i
could
have
prayed
that
a
triangle
of
fire
would
issue
from
the
entrails
of
the
dark
clouds
heavily
rolling
above
us
to
reduce
him
to
cinders
the
owls
which
had
been
nestling
in
the
cypress-trees
startled
by
the
gleam
of
the
lantern
flew
against
it
from
time
to
time
striking
their
dusty
wings
against
its
panes
and
uttering
plaintive
cries
of
lamentation
wild
foxes
yelped
in
the
far
darkness
and
a
thousand
sinister
noises
detached
themselves
from
the
silence
at
last
sã©ra-pionâ€™s
mattock
struck
the
coffin
itself
making
its
planks
re-echo
with
a
deep
sonorous
sound
with
that
terrible
sound
nothingness
utters
when
stricken
he
wrenched
apart
and
tore
up
the
lid
and
i
beheld
clarimonde
pallid
as
a
figure
of
marble
with
hands
joined
her
white
winding-sheet
made
but
one
fold
from
her
head
to
her
feet
a
little
crimson
drop
sparkled
like
a
speck
of
dew
at
one
corner
of
her
colourless
mouth
sã©rapion
at
this
spectacle
burst
into
fury
â€˜ah
thou
art
here
demon
impure
courtesan
drinker
of
blood
and
gold
â€˜and
he
flung
holy
water
upon
the
corpse
and
the
coffin
over
which
he
traced
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
his
sprinkler
poor
clarimonde
had
no
sooner
been
touched
by
the
blessed
spray
than
her
beautiful
body
crumbled
into
dust
and
became
only
a
shapeless
and
frightful
mass
of
cinders
and
half-calcined
bones
â€˜behold
your
mistress
my
lord
romualdâ€™
cried
the
inexorable
priest
as
he
pointed
to
these
sad
remains
â€˜will
you
be
easily
tempted
after
this
to
promenade
on
the
lido
or
at
fusina
with
your
beautyâ€™
i
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
a
vast
ruin
had
taken
place
within
me
i
returned
to
my
presbytery
and
the
noble
lord
romuald
the
lover
of
clarimonde
separated
himself
from
the
poor
priest
with
whom
he
had
kept
such
strange
company
so
long
but
once
only
the
following
night
i
saw
clarimonde
she
said
to
me
as
she
had
said
the
first
time
at
the
portals
of
the
church
â€˜unhappy
man
unhappy
man
what
hast
thou
done
wherefore
have
hearkened
to
that
imbecile
priest
wert
thou
not
happy
and
what
harm
had
i
ever
done
thee
that
thou
shouldst
violate
my
poor
tomb
and
lay
bare
the
miseries
of
my
nothingness
all
communication
between
our
souls
and
our
bodies
is
henceforth
for
ever
broken
adieu
thou
wilt
yet
regret
meâ€™
she
vanished
in
air
as
smoke
and
i
never
saw
her
more
alas
she
spoke
truly
indeed
i
have
regretted
her
more
than
once
and
i
regret
her
still
my
soulâ€™s
peace
has
been
very
dearly
bought
the
love
of
god
was
not
too
