a
few
months
before
the
lamented
death
of
my
husband--i
might
say
even
as
the
shadow
of
death
was
over
him--he
planned
three
series
of
short
stories
for
publication
and
the
present
volume
is
one
of
them
to
his
original
list
of
stories
in
this
book
i
have
added
an
hitherto
unpublished
episode
from
dracula
it
was
originally
excised
owing
to
the
length
of
the
book
and
may
prove
of
interest
to
the
many
readers
of
what
is
considered
my
husband's
most
remarkable
work
the
other
stories
have
already
been
published
in
english
and
american
periodicals
had
my
husband
lived
longer
he
might
have
seen
fit
to
revise
this
work
which
is
mainly
from
the
earlier
years
of
his
strenuous
life
but
as
fate
has
entrusted
to
me
the
issuing
of
it
i
consider
it
fitting
and
proper
to
let
it
go
forth
practically
as
it
was
left
by
him
florence
bram
stoker
dracula's
guest
when
we
started
for
our
drive
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
on
munich
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
joyousness
of
early
summer
just
as
we
were
about
to
depart
herr
delbrã¼ck
the
maã®tre
d'hã´tel
of
the
quatre
saisons
where
i
was
staying
came
down
bareheaded
to
the
carriage
and
after
wishing
me
a
pleasant
drive
said
to
the
coachman
still
holding
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
carriage
door
'remember
you
are
back
by
nightfall
the
sky
looks
bright
but
there
is
a
shiver
in
the
north
wind
that
says
there
may
be
a
sudden
storm
but
i
am
sure
you
will
not
be
late'
here
he
smiled
and
added
'for
you
know
what
night
it
is'
johann
answered
with
an
emphatic
'ja
mein
herr'
and
touching
his
hat
drove
off
quickly
when
we
had
cleared
the
town
i
said
after
signalling
to
him
to
stop
'tell
me
johann
what
is
tonight'
he
crossed
himself
as
he
answered
laconically
'walpurgis
nacht'
then
he
took
out
his
watch
a
great
old-fashioned
german
silver
thing
as
big
as
a
turnip
and
looked
at
it
with
his
eyebrows
gathered
together
and
a
little
impatient
shrug
of
his
shoulders
i
realised
that
this
was
his
way
of
respectfully
protesting
against
the
unnecessary
delay
and
sank
back
in
the
carriage
merely
motioning
him
to
proceed
he
started
off
rapidly
as
if
to
make
up
for
lost
time
every
now
and
then
the
horses
seemed
to
throw
up
their
heads
and
sniffed
the
air
suspiciously
on
such
occasions
i
often
looked
round
in
alarm
the
road
was
pretty
bleak
for
we
were
traversing
a
sort
of
high
wind-swept
plateau
as
we
drove
i
saw
a
road
that
looked
but
little
used
and
which
seemed
to
dip
through
a
little
winding
valley
it
looked
so
inviting
that
even
at
the
risk
of
offending
him
i
called
johann
to
stop--and
when
he
had
pulled
up
i
told
him
i
would
like
to
drive
down
that
road
he
made
all
sorts
of
excuses
and
frequently
crossed
himself
as
he
spoke
this
somewhat
piqued
my
curiosity
so
i
asked
him
various
questions
he
answered
fencingly
and
repeatedly
looked
at
his
watch
in
protest
finally
i
said
'well
johann
i
want
to
go
down
this
road
i
shall
not
ask
you
to
come
unless
you
like
but
tell
me
why
you
do
not
like
to
go
that
is
all
i
ask'
for
answer
he
seemed
to
throw
himself
off
the
box
so
quickly
did
he
reach
the
ground
then
he
stretched
out
his
hands
appealingly
to
me
and
implored
me
not
to
go
there
was
just
enough
of
english
mixed
with
the
german
for
me
to
understand
the
drift
of
his
talk
he
seemed
always
just
about
to
tell
me
something--the
very
idea
of
which
evidently
frightened
him
but
each
time
he
pulled
himself
up
saying
as
he
crossed
himself
'walpurgis-nacht'
i
tried
to
argue
with
him
but
it
was
difficult
to
argue
with
a
man
when
i
did
not
know
his
language
the
advantage
certainly
rested
with
him
for
although
he
began
to
speak
in
english
of
a
very
crude
and
broken
kind
he
always
got
excited
and
broke
into
his
native
tongue--and
every
time
he
did
so
he
looked
at
his
watch
then
the
horses
became
restless
and
sniffed
the
air
at
this
he
grew
very
pale
and
looking
around
in
a
frightened
way
he
suddenly
jumped
forward
took
them
by
the
bridles
and
led
them
on
some
twenty
feet
i
followed
and
asked
why
he
had
done
this
for
answer
he
crossed
himself
pointed
to
the
spot
we
had
left
and
drew
his
carriage
in
the
direction
of
the
other
road
indicating
a
cross
and
said
first
in
german
then
in
english
'buried
him--him
what
killed
themselves'
i
remembered
the
old
custom
of
burying
suicides
at
cross-roads
'ah
i
see
a
suicide
how
interesting'
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
make
out
why
the
horses
were
frightened
whilst
we
were
talking
we
heard
a
sort
of
sound
between
a
yelp
and
a
bark
it
was
far
away
but
the
horses
got
very
restless
and
it
took
johann
all
his
time
to
quiet
them
he
was
pale
and
said
'it
sounds
like
a
wolf--but
yet
there
are
no
wolves
here
now'
'no'
i
said
questioning
him
'isn't
it
long
since
the
wolves
were
so
near
the
city'
'long
long'
he
answered
'in
the
spring
and
summer
but
with
the
snow
the
wolves
have
been
here
not
so
long'
whilst
he
was
petting
the
horses
and
trying
to
quiet
them
dark
clouds
drifted
rapidly
across
the
sky
the
sunshine
passed
away
and
a
breath
of
cold
wind
seemed
to
drift
past
us
it
was
only
a
breath
however
and
more
in
the
nature
of
a
warning
than
a
fact
for
the
sun
came
out
brightly
again
johann
looked
under
his
lifted
hand
at
the
horizon
and
said
'the
storm
of
snow
he
comes
before
long
time'
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
again
and
straightway
holding
his
reins
firmly--for
the
horses
were
still
pawing
the
ground
restlessly
and
shaking
their
heads--he
climbed
to
his
box
as
though
the
time
had
come
for
proceeding
on
our
journey
i
felt
a
little
obstinate
and
did
not
at
once
get
into
the
carriage
'tell
me'
i
said
'about
this
place
where
the
road
leads'
and
i
pointed
down
again
he
crossed
himself
and
mumbled
a
prayer
before
he
answered
'it
is
unholy'
'what
is
unholy'
i
enquired
'the
village'
'then
there
is
a
village'
'no
no
no
one
lives
there
hundreds
of
years'
my
curiosity
was
piqued
'but
you
said
there
was
a
village'
'there
was'
'where
is
it
now'
whereupon
he
burst
out
into
a
long
story
in
german
and
english
so
mixed
up
that
i
could
not
quite
understand
exactly
what
he
said
but
roughly
i
gathered
that
long
ago
hundreds
of
years
men
had
died
there
and
been
buried
in
their
graves
and
sounds
were
heard
under
the
clay
and
when
the
graves
were
opened
men
and
women
were
found
rosy
with
life
and
their
mouths
red
with
blood
and
so
in
haste
to
save
their
lives
aye
and
their
souls--and
here
he
crossed
himself
those
who
were
left
fled
away
to
other
places
where
the
living
lived
and
the
dead
were
dead
and
not--not
something
he
was
evidently
afraid
to
speak
the
last
words
as
he
proceeded
with
his
narration
he
grew
more
and
more
excited
it
seemed
as
if
his
imagination
had
got
hold
of
him
and
he
ended
in
a
perfect
paroxysm
of
fear--white-faced
perspiring
trembling
and
looking
round
him
as
if
expecting
that
some
dreadful
presence
would
manifest
itself
there
in
the
bright
sunshine
on
the
open
plain
finally
in
an
agony
of
desperation
he
cried
'walpurgis
nacht'
and
pointed
to
the
carriage
for
me
to
get
in
all
my
english
blood
rose
at
this
and
standing
back
i
said
'you
are
afraid
johann--you
are
afraid
go
home
i
shall
return
alone
the
walk
will
do
me
good'
the
carriage
door
was
open
i
took
from
the
seat
my
oak
walking-stick--which
i
always
carry
on
my
holiday
excursions--and
closed
the
door
pointing
back
to
munich
and
said
'go
home
johann--walpurgis-nacht
doesn't
concern
englishmen'
the
horses
were
now
more
restive
than
ever
and
johann
was
trying
to
hold
them
in
while
excitedly
imploring
me
not
to
do
anything
so
foolish
i
pitied
the
poor
fellow
he
was
deeply
in
earnest
but
all
the
same
i
could
not
help
laughing
his
english
was
quite
gone
now
in
his
anxiety
he
had
forgotten
that
his
only
means
of
making
me
understand
was
to
talk
my
language
so
he
jabbered
away
in
his
native
german
it
began
to
be
a
little
tedious
after
giving
the
direction
'home'
i
turned
to
go
down
the
cross-road
into
the
valley
with
a
despairing
gesture
johann
turned
his
horses
towards
munich
i
leaned
on
my
stick
and
looked
after
him
he
went
slowly
along
the
road
for
a
while
then
there
came
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
a
man
tall
and
thin
i
could
see
so
much
in
the
distance
when
he
drew
near
the
horses
they
began
to
jump
and
kick
about
then
to
scream
with
terror
johann
could
not
hold
them
in
they
bolted
down
the
road
running
away
madly
i
watched
them
out
of
sight
then
looked
for
the
stranger
but
i
found
that
he
too
was
gone
with
a
light
heart
i
turned
down
the
side
road
through
the
deepening
valley
to
which
johann
had
objected
there
was
not
the
slightest
reason
that
i
could
see
for
his
objection
and
i
daresay
i
tramped
for
a
couple
of
hours
without
thinking
of
time
or
distance
and
certainly
without
seeing
a
person
or
a
house
so
far
as
the
place
was
concerned
it
was
desolation
itself
but
i
did
not
notice
this
particularly
till
on
turning
a
bend
in
the
road
i
came
upon
a
scattered
fringe
of
wood
then
i
recognised
that
i
had
been
impressed
unconsciously
by
the
desolation
of
the
region
through
which
i
had
passed
i
sat
down
to
rest
myself
and
began
to
look
around
it
struck
me
that
it
was
considerably
colder
than
it
had
been
at
the
commencement
of
my
walk--a
sort
of
sighing
sound
seemed
to
be
around
me
with
now
and
then
high
overhead
a
sort
of
muffled
roar
looking
upwards
i
noticed
that
great
thick
clouds
were
drifting
rapidly
across
the
sky
from
north
to
south
at
a
great
height
there
were
signs
of
coming
storm
in
some
lofty
stratum
of
the
air
i
was
a
little
chilly
and
thinking
that
it
was
the
sitting
still
after
the
exercise
of
walking
i
resumed
my
journey
the
ground
i
passed
over
was
now
much
more
picturesque
there
were
no
striking
objects
that
the
eye
might
single
out
but
in
all
there
was
a
charm
of
beauty
i
took
little
heed
of
time
and
it
was
only
when
the
deepening
twilight
forced
itself
upon
me
that
i
began
to
think
of
how
i
should
find
my
way
home
the
brightness
of
the
day
had
gone
the
air
was
cold
and
the
drifting
of
clouds
high
overhead
was
more
marked
they
were
accompanied
by
a
sort
of
far-away
rushing
sound
through
which
seemed
to
come
at
intervals
that
mysterious
cry
which
the
driver
had
said
came
from
a
wolf
for
a
while
i
hesitated
i
had
said
i
would
see
the
deserted
village
so
on
i
went
and
presently
came
on
a
wide
stretch
of
open
country
shut
in
by
hills
all
around
their
sides
were
covered
with
trees
which
spread
down
to
the
plain
dotting
in
clumps
the
gentler
slopes
and
hollows
which
showed
here
and
there
i
followed
with
my
eye
the
winding
of
the
road
and
saw
that
it
curved
close
to
one
of
the
densest
of
these
clumps
and
was
lost
behind
it
as
i
looked
there
came
a
cold
shiver
in
the
air
and
the
snow
began
to
fall
i
thought
of
the
miles
and
miles
of
bleak
country
i
had
passed
and
then
hurried
on
to
seek
the
shelter
of
the
wood
in
front
darker
and
darker
grew
the
sky
and
faster
and
heavier
fell
the
snow
till
the
earth
before
and
around
me
was
a
glistening
white
carpet
the
further
edge
of
which
was
lost
in
misty
vagueness
the
road
was
here
but
crude
and
when
on
the
level
its
boundaries
were
not
so
marked
as
when
it
passed
through
the
cuttings
and
in
a
little
while
i
found
that
i
must
have
strayed
from
it
for
i
missed
underfoot
the
hard
surface
and
my
feet
sank
deeper
in
the
grass
and
moss
then
the
wind
grew
stronger
and
blew
with
ever
increasing
force
till
i
was
fain
to
run
before
it
the
air
became
icy-cold
and
in
spite
of
my
exercise
i
began
to
suffer
the
snow
was
now
falling
so
thickly
and
whirling
around
me
in
such
rapid
eddies
that
i
could
hardly
keep
my
eyes
open
every
now
and
then
the
heavens
were
torn
asunder
by
vivid
lightning
and
in
the
flashes
i
could
see
ahead
of
me
a
great
mass
of
trees
chiefly
yew
and
cypress
all
heavily
coated
with
snow
i
was
soon
amongst
the
shelter
of
the
trees
and
there
in
comparative
silence
i
could
hear
the
rush
of
the
wind
high
overhead
presently
the
blackness
of
the
storm
had
become
merged
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
by-and-by
the
storm
seemed
to
be
passing
away
it
now
only
came
in
fierce
puffs
or
blasts
at
such
moments
the
weird
sound
of
the
wolf
appeared
to
be
echoed
by
many
similar
sounds
around
me
now
and
again
through
the
black
mass
of
drifting
cloud
came
a
straggling
ray
of
moonlight
which
lit
up
the
expanse
and
showed
me
that
i
was
at
the
edge
of
a
dense
mass
of
cypress
and
yew
trees
as
the
snow
had
ceased
to
fall
i
walked
out
from
the
shelter
and
began
to
investigate
more
closely
it
appeared
to
me
that
amongst
so
many
old
foundations
as
i
had
passed
there
might
be
still
standing
a
house
in
which
though
in
ruins
i
could
find
some
sort
of
shelter
for
a
while
as
i
skirted
the
edge
of
the
copse
i
found
that
a
low
wall
encircled
it
and
following
this
i
presently
found
an
opening
here
the
cypresses
formed
an
alley
leading
up
to
a
square
mass
of
some
kind
of
building
just
as
i
caught
sight
of
this
however
the
drifting
clouds
obscured
the
moon
and
i
passed
up
the
path
in
darkness
the
wind
must
have
grown
colder
for
i
felt
myself
shiver
as
i
walked
but
there
was
hope
of
shelter
and
i
groped
my
way
blindly
on
i
stopped
for
there
was
a
sudden
stillness
the
storm
had
passed
and
perhaps
in
sympathy
with
nature's
silence
my
heart
seemed
to
cease
to
beat
but
this
was
only
momentarily
for
suddenly
the
moonlight
broke
through
the
clouds
showing
me
that
i
was
in
a
graveyard
and
that
the
square
object
before
me
was
a
great
massive
tomb
of
marble
as
white
as
the
snow
that
lay
on
and
all
around
it
with
the
moonlight
there
came
a
fierce
sigh
of
the
storm
which
appeared
to
resume
its
course
with
a
long
low
howl
as
of
many
dogs
or
wolves
i
was
awed
and
shocked
and
felt
the
cold
perceptibly
grow
upon
me
till
it
seemed
to
grip
me
by
the
heart
then
while
the
flood
of
moonlight
still
fell
on
the
marble
tomb
the
storm
gave
further
evidence
of
renewing
as
though
it
was
returning
on
its
track
impelled
by
some
sort
of
fascination
i
approached
the
sepulchre
to
see
what
it
was
and
why
such
a
thing
stood
alone
in
such
a
place
i
walked
around
it
and
read
over
the
doric
door
in
german
countess
dolingen
of
gratz
in
styria
sought
and
found
death
1801
on
the
top
of
the
tomb
seemingly
driven
through
the
solid
marble--for
the
structure
was
composed
of
a
few
vast
blocks
of
stone--was
a
great
iron
spike
or
stake
on
going
to
the
back
i
saw
graven
in
great
russian
letters
'the
dead
travel
fast'
there
was
something
so
weird
and
uncanny
about
the
whole
thing
that
it
gave
me
a
turn
and
made
me
feel
quite
faint
i
began
to
wish
for
the
first
time
that
i
had
taken
johann's
advice
here
a
thought
struck
me
which
came
under
almost
mysterious
circumstances
and
with
a
terrible
shock
this
was
walpurgis
night
walpurgis
night
when
according
to
the
belief
of
millions
of
people
the
devil
was
abroad--when
the
graves
were
opened
and
the
dead
came
forth
and
walked
when
all
evil
things
of
earth
and
air
and
water
held
revel
this
very
place
the
driver
had
specially
shunned
this
was
the
depopulated
village
of
centuries
ago
this
was
where
the
suicide
lay
and
this
was
the
place
where
i
was
alone--unmanned
shivering
with
cold
in
a
shroud
of
snow
with
a
wild
storm
gathering
again
upon
me
it
took
all
my
philosophy
all
the
religion
i
had
been
taught
all
my
courage
not
to
collapse
in
a
paroxysm
of
fright
and
now
a
perfect
tornado
burst
upon
me
the
ground
shook
as
though
thousands
of
horses
thundered
across
it
and
this
time
the
storm
bore
on
its
icy
wings
not
snow
but
great
hailstones
which
drove
with
such
violence
that
they
might
have
come
from
the
thongs
of
balearic
slingers--hailstones
that
beat
down
leaf
and
branch
and
made
the
shelter
of
the
cypresses
of
no
more
avail
than
though
their
stems
were
standing-corn
at
the
first
i
had
rushed
to
the
nearest
tree
but
i
was
soon
fain
to
leave
it
and
seek
the
only
spot
that
seemed
to
afford
refuge
the
deep
doric
doorway
of
the
marble
tomb
there
crouching
against
the
massive
bronze
door
i
gained
a
certain
amount
of
protection
from
the
beating
of
the
hailstones
for
now
they
only
drove
against
me
as
they
ricocheted
from
the
ground
and
the
side
of
the
marble
as
i
leaned
against
the
door
it
moved
slightly
and
opened
inwards
the
shelter
of
even
a
tomb
was
welcome
in
that
pitiless
tempest
and
i
was
about
to
enter
it
when
there
came
a
flash
of
forked-lightning
that
lit
up
the
whole
expanse
of
the
heavens
in
the
instant
as
i
am
a
living
man
i
saw
as
my
eyes
were
turned
into
the
darkness
of
the
tomb
a
beautiful
woman
with
rounded
cheeks
and
red
lips
seemingly
sleeping
on
a
bier
as
the
thunder
broke
overhead
i
was
grasped
as
by
the
hand
of
a
giant
and
hurled
out
into
the
storm
the
whole
thing
was
so
sudden
that
before
i
could
realise
the
shock
moral
as
well
as
physical
i
found
the
hailstones
beating
me
down
at
the
same
time
i
had
a
strange
dominating
feeling
that
i
was
not
alone
i
looked
towards
the
tomb
just
then
there
came
another
blinding
flash
which
seemed
to
strike
the
iron
stake
that
surmounted
the
tomb
and
to
pour
through
to
the
earth
blasting
and
crumbling
the
marble
as
in
a
burst
of
flame
the
dead
woman
rose
for
a
moment
of
agony
while
she
was
lapped
in
the
flame
and
her
bitter
scream
of
pain
was
drowned
in
the
thundercrash
the
last
thing
i
heard
was
this
mingling
of
dreadful
sound
as
again
i
was
seized
in
the
giant-grasp
and
dragged
away
while
the
hailstones
beat
on
me
and
the
air
around
seemed
reverberant
with
the
howling
of
wolves
the
last
sight
that
i
remembered
was
a
vague
white
moving
mass
as
if
all
the
graves
around
me
had
sent
out
the
phantoms
of
their
sheeted-dead
and
that
they
were
closing
in
on
me
through
the
white
cloudiness
of
the
driving
hail





gradually
there
came
a
sort
of
vague
beginning
of
consciousness
then
a
sense
of
weariness
that
was
dreadful
for
a
time
i
remembered
nothing
but
slowly
my
senses
returned
my
feet
seemed
positively
racked
with
pain
yet
i
could
not
move
them
they
seemed
to
be
numbed
there
was
an
icy
feeling
at
the
back
of
my
neck
and
all
down
my
spine
and
my
ears
like
my
feet
were
dead
yet
in
torment
but
there
was
in
my
breast
a
sense
of
warmth
which
was
by
comparison
delicious
it
was
as
a
nightmare--a
physical
nightmare
if
one
may
use
such
an
expression
for
some
heavy
weight
on
my
chest
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
breathe
this
period
of
semi-lethargy
seemed
to
remain
a
long
time
and
as
it
faded
away
i
must
have
slept
or
swooned
then
came
a
sort
of
loathing
like
the
first
stage
of
sea-sickness
and
a
wild
desire
to
be
free
from
something--i
knew
not
what
a
vast
stillness
enveloped
me
as
though
all
the
world
were
asleep
or
dead--only
broken
by
the
low
panting
as
of
some
animal
close
to
me
i
felt
a
warm
rasping
at
my
throat
then
came
a
consciousness
of
the
awful
truth
which
chilled
me
to
the
heart
and
sent
the
blood
surging
up
through
my
brain
some
great
animal
was
lying
on
me
and
now
licking
my
throat
i
feared
to
stir
for
some
instinct
of
prudence
bade
me
lie
still
but
the
brute
seemed
to
realise
that
there
was
now
some
change
in
me
for
it
raised
its
head
through
my
eyelashes
i
saw
above
me
the
two
great
flaming
eyes
of
a
gigantic
wolf
its
sharp
white
teeth
gleamed
in
the
gaping
red
mouth
and
i
could
feel
its
hot
breath
fierce
and
acrid
upon
me
for
another
spell
of
time
i
remembered
no
more
then
i
became
conscious
of
a
low
growl
followed
by
a
yelp
renewed
again
and
again
then
seemingly
very
far
away
i
heard
a
'holloa
holloa'
as
of
many
voices
calling
in
unison
cautiously
i
raised
my
head
and
looked
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
came
but
the
cemetery
blocked
my
view
the
wolf
still
continued
to
yelp
in
a
strange
way
and
a
red
glare
began
to
move
round
the
grove
of
cypresses
as
though
following
the
sound
as
the
voices
drew
closer
the
wolf
yelped
faster
and
louder
i
feared
to
make
either
sound
or
motion
nearer
came
the
red
glow
over
the
white
pall
which
stretched
into
the
darkness
around
me
then
all
at
once
from
beyond
the
trees
there
came
at
a
trot
a
troop
of
horsemen
bearing
torches
the
wolf
rose
from
my
breast
and
made
for
the
cemetery
i
saw
one
of
the
horsemen
soldiers
by
their
caps
and
their
long
military
cloaks
raise
his
carbine
and
take
aim
a
companion
knocked
up
his
arm
and
i
heard
the
ball
whizz
over
my
head
he
had
evidently
taken
my
body
for
that
of
the
wolf
another
sighted
the
animal
as
it
slunk
away
and
a
shot
followed
then
at
a
gallop
the
troop
rode
forward--some
towards
me
others
following
the
wolf
as
it
disappeared
amongst
the
snow-clad
cypresses
as
they
drew
nearer
i
tried
to
move
but
was
powerless
although
i
could
see
and
hear
all
that
went
on
around
me
two
or
three
of
the
soldiers
jumped
from
their
horses
and
knelt
beside
me
one
of
them
raised
my
head
and
placed
his
hand
over
my
heart
'good
news
comrades'
he
cried
'his
heart
still
beats'
then
some
brandy
was
poured
down
my
throat
it
put
vigour
into
me
and
i
was
able
to
open
my
eyes
fully
and
look
around
lights
and
shadows
were
moving
among
the
trees
and
i
heard
men
call
to
one
another
they
drew
together
uttering
frightened
exclamations
and
the
lights
flashed
as
the
others
came
pouring
out
of
the
cemetery
pell-mell
like
men
possessed
when
the
further
ones
came
close
to
us
those
who
were
around
me
asked
them
eagerly
'well
have
you
found
him'
the
reply
rang
out
hurriedly
'no
no
come
away
quick--quick
this
is
no
place
to
stay
and
on
this
of
all
nights'
'what
was
it'
was
the
question
asked
in
all
manner
of
keys
the
answer
came
variously
and
all
indefinitely
as
though
the
men
were
moved
by
some
common
impulse
to
speak
yet
were
restrained
by
some
common
fear
from
giving
their
thoughts
'it--it--indeed'
gibbered
one
whose
wits
had
plainly
given
out
for
the
moment
'a
wolf--and
yet
not
a
wolf'
another
put
in
shudderingly
'no
use
trying
for
him
without
the
sacred
bullet'
a
third
remarked
in
a
more
ordinary
manner
'serve
us
right
for
coming
out
on
this
night
truly
we
have
earned
our
thousand
marks'
were
the
ejaculations
of
a
fourth
'there
was
blood
on
the
broken
marble'
another
said
after
a
pause--'the
lightning
never
brought
that
there
and
for
him--is
he
safe
look
at
his
throat
see
comrades
the
wolf
has
been
lying
on
him
and
keeping
his
blood
warm'
the
officer
looked
at
my
throat
and
replied
'he
is
all
right
the
skin
is
not
pierced
what
does
it
all
mean
we
should
never
have
found
him
but
for
the
yelping
of
the
wolf'
'what
became
of
it'
asked
the
man
who
was
holding
up
my
head
and
who
seemed
the
least
panic-stricken
of
the
party
for
his
hands
were
steady
and
without
tremor
on
his
sleeve
was
the
chevron
of
a
petty
officer
'it
went
to
its
home'
answered
the
man
whose
long
face
was
pallid
and
who
actually
shook
with
terror
as
he
glanced
around
him
fearfully
'there
are
graves
enough
there
in
which
it
may
lie
come
comrades--come
quickly
let
us
leave
this
cursed
spot'
the
officer
raised
me
to
a
sitting
posture
as
he
uttered
a
word
of
command
then
several
men
placed
me
upon
a
horse
he
sprang
to
the
saddle
behind
me
took
me
in
his
arms
gave
the
word
to
advance
and
turning
our
faces
away
from
the
cypresses
we
rode
away
in
swift
military
order
as
yet
my
tongue
refused
its
office
and
i
was
perforce
silent
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
the
next
thing
i
remembered
was
finding
myself
standing
up
supported
by
a
soldier
on
each
side
of
me
it
was
almost
broad
daylight
and
to
the
north
a
red
streak
of
sunlight
was
reflected
like
a
path
of
blood
over
the
waste
of
snow
the
officer
was
telling
the
men
to
say
nothing
of
what
they
had
seen
except
that
they
found
an
english
stranger
guarded
by
a
large
dog
'dog
that
was
no
dog'
cut
in
the
man
who
had
exhibited
such
fear
'i
think
i
know
a
wolf
when
i
see
one'
the
young
officer
answered
calmly
'i
said
a
dog'
'dog'
reiterated
the
other
ironically
it
was
evident
that
his
courage
was
rising
with
the
sun
and
pointing
to
me
he
said
'look
at
his
throat
is
that
the
work
of
a
dog
master'
instinctively
i
raised
my
hand
to
my
throat
and
as
i
touched
it
i
cried
out
in
pain
the
men
crowded
round
to
look
some
stooping
down
from
their
saddles
and
again
there
came
the
calm
voice
of
the
young
officer
'a
dog
as
i
said
if
aught
else
were
said
we
should
only
be
laughed
at'
i
was
then
mounted
behind
a
trooper
and
we
rode
on
into
the
suburbs
of
munich
here
we
came
across
a
stray
carriage
into
which
i
was
lifted
and
it
was
driven
off
to
the
quatre
saisons--the
young
officer
accompanying
me
whilst
a
trooper
followed
with
his
horse
and
the
others
rode
off
to
their
barracks
when
we
arrived
herr
delbrã¼ck
rushed
so
quickly
down
the
steps
to
meet
me
that
it
was
apparent
he
had
been
watching
within
taking
me
by
both
hands
he
solicitously
led
me
in
the
officer
saluted
me
and
was
turning
to
withdraw
when
i
recognised
his
purpose
and
insisted
that
he
should
come
to
my
rooms
over
a
glass
of
wine
i
warmly
thanked
him
and
his
brave
comrades
for
saving
me
he
replied
simply
that
he
was
more
than
glad
and
that
herr
delbrã¼ck
had
at
the
first
taken
steps
to
make
all
the
searching
party
pleased
at
which
ambiguous
utterance
the
maã®tre
d'hã´tel
smiled
while
the
officer
pleaded
duty
and
withdrew
'but
herr
delbrã¼ck'
i
enquired
'how
and
why
was
it
that
the
soldiers
searched
for
me'
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
in
depreciation
of
his
own
deed
as
he
replied
'i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
obtain
leave
from
the
commander
of
the
regiment
in
which
i
served
to
ask
for
volunteers'
'but
how
did
you
know
i
was
lost'
i
asked
'the
driver
came
hither
with
the
remains
of
his
carriage
which
had
been
upset
when
the
horses
ran
away'
'but
surely
you
would
not
send
a
search-party
of
soldiers
merely
on
this
account'
'oh
no'
he
answered
'but
even
before
the
coachman
arrived
i
had
this
telegram
from
the
boyar
whose
guest
you
are'
and
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
telegram
which
he
handed
to
me
and
i
read
bistritz
be
careful
of
my
guest--his
safety
is
most
precious
to
me
should
aught
happen
to
him
or
if
he
be
missed
spare
nothing
to
find
him
and
ensure
his
safety
he
is
english
and
therefore
adventurous
there
are
often
dangers
from
snow
and
wolves
and
night
lose
not
a
moment
if
you
suspect
harm
to
him
i
answer
your
zeal
with
my
fortune--dracula
as
i
held
the
telegram
in
my
hand
the
room
seemed
to
whirl
around
me
and
if
the
attentive
maã®tre
d'hã´tel
had
not
caught
me
i
think
i
should
have
fallen
there
was
something
so
strange
in
all
this
something
so
weird
and
impossible
to
imagine
that
there
grew
on
me
a
sense
of
my
being
in
some
way
the
sport
of
opposite
forces--the
mere
vague
idea
of
which
seemed
in
a
way
to
paralyse
me
i
was
certainly
under
some
form
of
mysterious
protection
from
a
distant
country
had
come
in
the
very
nick
of
time
a
message
that
took
me
out
of
the
danger
of
the
snow-sleep
and
the
jaws
of
the
wolf
the
judge's
house
when
the
time
for
his
examination
drew
near
malcolm
malcolmson
made
up
his
mind
to
go
somewhere
to
read
by
himself
he
feared
the
attractions
of
the
seaside
and
also
he
feared
completely
rural
isolation
for
of
old
he
knew
it
charms
and
so
he
determined
to
find
some
unpretentious
little
town
where
there
would
be
nothing
to
distract
him
he
refrained
from
asking
suggestions
from
any
of
his
friends
for
he
argued
that
each
would
recommend
some
place
of
which
he
had
knowledge
and
where
he
had
already
acquaintances
as
malcolmson
wished
to
avoid
friends
he
had
no
wish
to
encumber
himself
with
the
attention
of
friends'
friends
and
so
he
determined
to
look
out
for
a
place
for
himself
he
packed
a
portmanteau
with
some
clothes
and
all
the
books
he
required
and
then
took
ticket
for
the
first
name
on
the
local
time-table
which
he
did
not
know
when
at
the
end
of
three
hours'
journey
he
alighted
at
benchurch
he
felt
satisfied
that
he
had
so
far
obliterated
his
tracks
as
to
be
sure
of
having
a
peaceful
opportunity
of
pursuing
his
studies
he
went
straight
to
the
one
inn
which
the
sleepy
little
place
contained
and
put
up
for
the
night
benchurch
was
a
market
town
and
once
in
three
weeks
was
crowded
to
excess
but
for
the
remainder
of
the
twenty-one
days
it
was
as
attractive
as
a
desert
malcolmson
looked
around
the
day
after
his
arrival
to
try
to
find
quarters
more
isolated
than
even
so
quiet
an
inn
as
'the
good
traveller'
afforded
there
was
only
one
place
which
took
his
fancy
and
it
certainly
satisfied
his
wildest
ideas
regarding
quiet
in
fact
quiet
was
not
the
proper
word
to
apply
to
it--desolation
was
the
only
term
conveying
any
suitable
idea
of
its
isolation
it
was
an
old
rambling
heavy-built
house
of
the
jacobean
style
with
heavy
gables
and
windows
unusually
small
and
set
higher
than
was
customary
in
such
houses
and
was
surrounded
with
a
high
brick
wall
massively
built
indeed
on
examination
it
looked
more
like
a
fortified
house
than
an
ordinary
dwelling
but
all
these
things
pleased
malcolmson
'here'
he
thought
'is
the
very
spot
i
have
been
looking
for
and
if
i
can
get
opportunity
of
using
it
i
shall
be
happy'
his
joy
was
increased
when
he
realised
beyond
doubt
that
it
was
not
at
present
inhabited
from
the
post-office
he
got
the
name
of
the
agent
who
was
rarely
surprised
at
the
application
to
rent
a
part
of
the
old
house
mr
carnford
the
local
lawyer
and
agent
was
a
genial
old
gentleman
and
frankly
confessed
his
delight
at
anyone
being
willing
to
live
in
the
house
'to
tell
you
the
truth'
said
he
'i
should
be
only
too
happy
on
behalf
of
the
owners
to
let
anyone
have
the
house
rent
free
for
a
term
of
years
if
only
to
accustom
the
people
here
to
see
it
inhabited
it
has
been
so
long
empty
that
some
kind
of
absurd
prejudice
has
grown
up
about
it
and
this
can
be
best
put
down
by
its
occupation--if
only'
he
added
with
a
sly
glance
at
malcolmson
'by
a
scholar
like
yourself
who
wants
its
quiet
for
a
time'
malcolmson
thought
it
needless
to
ask
the
agent
about
the
'absurd
prejudice'
he
knew
he
would
get
more
information
if
he
should
require
it
on
that
subject
from
other
quarters
he
paid
his
three
months'
rent
got
a
receipt
and
the
name
of
an
old
woman
who
would
probably
undertake
to
'do'
for
him
and
came
away
with
the
keys
in
his
pocket
he
then
went
to
the
landlady
of
the
inn
who
was
a
cheerful
and
most
kindly
person
and
asked
her
advice
as
to
such
stores
and
provisions
as
he
would
be
likely
to
require
she
threw
up
her
hands
in
amazement
when
he
told
her
where
he
was
going
to
settle
himself
'not
in
the
judge's
house'
she
said
and
grew
pale
as
she
spoke
he
explained
the
locality
of
the
house
saying
that
he
did
not
know
its
name
when
he
had
finished
she
answered
'aye
sure
enough--sure
enough
the
very
place
it
is
the
judge's
house
sure
enough'
he
asked
her
to
tell
him
about
the
place
why
so
called
and
what
there
was
against
it
she
told
him
that
it
was
so
called
locally
because
it
had
been
many
years
before--how
long
she
could
not
say
as
she
was
herself
from
another
part
of
the
country
but
she
thought
it
must
have
been
a
hundred
years
or
more--the
abode
of
a
judge
who
was
held
in
great
terror
on
account
of
his
harsh
sentences
and
his
hostility
to
prisoners
at
assizes
as
to
what
there
was
against
the
house
itself
she
could
not
tell
she
had
often
asked
but
no
one
could
inform
her
but
there
was
a
general
feeling
that
there
was
something
and
for
her
own
part
she
would
not
take
all
the
money
in
drinkwater's
bank
and
stay
in
the
house
an
hour
by
herself
then
she
apologised
to
malcolmson
for
her
disturbing
talk
'it
is
too
bad
of
me
sir
and
you--and
a
young
gentlemen
too--if
you
will
pardon
me
saying
it
going
to
live
there
all
alone
if
you
were
my
boy--and
you'll
excuse
me
for
saying
it--you
wouldn't
sleep
there
a
night
not
if
i
had
to
go
there
myself
and
pull
the
big
alarm
bell
that's
on
the
roof'
the
good
creature
was
so
manifestly
in
earnest
and
was
so
kindly
in
her
intentions
that
malcolmson
although
amused
was
touched
he
told
her
kindly
how
much
he
appreciated
her
interest
in
him
and
added
'but
my
dear
mrs
witham
indeed
you
need
not
be
concerned
about
me
a
man
who
is
reading
for
the
mathematical
tripos
has
too
much
to
think
of
to
be
disturbed
by
any
of
these
mysterious
somethings
and
his
work
is
of
too
exact
and
prosaic
a
kind
to
allow
of
his
having
any
corner
in
his
mind
for
mysteries
of
any
kind
harmonical
progression
permutations
and
combinations
and
elliptic
functions
have
sufficient
mysteries
for
me'
mrs
witham
kindly
undertook
to
see
after
his
commissions
and
he
went
himself
to
look
for
the
old
woman
who
had
been
recommended
to
him
when
he
returned
to
the
judge's
house
with
her
after
an
interval
of
a
couple
of
hours
he
found
mrs
witham
herself
waiting
with
several
men
and
boys
carrying
parcels
and
an
upholsterer's
man
with
a
bed
in
a
car
for
she
said
though
tables
and
chairs
might
be
all
very
well
a
bed
that
hadn't
been
aired
for
mayhap
fifty
years
was
not
proper
for
young
bones
to
lie
on
she
was
evidently
curious
to
see
the
inside
of
the
house
and
though
manifestly
so
afraid
of
the
'somethings'
that
at
the
slightest
sound
she
clutched
on
to
malcolmson
whom
she
never
left
for
a
moment
went
over
the
whole
place
after
his
examination
of
the
house
malcolmson
decided
to
take
up
his
abode
in
the
great
dining-room
which
was
big
enough
to
serve
for
all
his
requirements
and
mrs
witham
with
the
aid
of
the
charwoman
mrs
dempster
proceeded
to
arrange
matters
when
the
hampers
were
brought
in
and
unpacked
malcolmson
saw
that
with
much
kind
forethought
she
had
sent
from
her
own
kitchen
sufficient
provisions
to
last
for
a
few
days
before
going
she
expressed
all
sorts
of
kind
wishes
and
at
the
door
turned
and
said
'and
perhaps
sir
as
the
room
is
big
and
draughty
it
might
be
well
to
have
one
of
those
big
screens
put
round
your
bed
at
night--though
truth
to
tell
i
would
die
myself
if
i
were
to
be
so
shut
in
with
all
kinds
of--of
things
that
put
their
heads
round
the
sides
or
over
the
top
and
look
on
me'
the
image
which
she
had
called
up
was
too
much
for
her
nerves
and
she
fled
incontinently
mrs
dempster
sniffed
in
a
superior
manner
as
the
landlady
disappeared
and
remarked
that
for
her
own
part
she
wasn't
afraid
of
all
the
bogies
in
the
kingdom
'i'll
tell
you
what
it
is
sir'
she
said
'bogies
is
all
kinds
and
sorts
of
things--except
bogies
rats
and
mice
and
beetles
and
creaky
doors
and
loose
slates
and
broken
panes
and
stiff
drawer
handles
that
stay
out
when
you
pull
them
and
then
fall
down
in
the
middle
of
the
night
look
at
the
wainscot
of
the
room
it
is
old--hundreds
of
years
old
do
you
think
there's
no
rats
and
beetles
there
and
do
you
imagine
sir
that
you
won't
see
none
of
them
rats
is
bogies
i
tell
you
and
bogies
is
rats
and
don't
you
get
to
think
anything
else'
'mrs
dempster'
said
malcolmson
gravely
making
her
a
polite
bow
'you
know
more
than
a
senior
wrangler
and
let
me
say
that
as
a
mark
of
esteem
for
your
indubitable
soundness
of
head
and
heart
i
shall
when
i
go
give
you
possession
of
this
house
and
let
you
stay
here
by
yourself
for
the
last
two
months
of
my
tenancy
for
four
weeks
will
serve
my
purpose'
'thank
you
kindly
sir'
she
answered
'but
i
couldn't
sleep
away
from
home
a
night
i
am
in
greenhow's
charity
and
if
i
slept
a
night
away
from
my
rooms
i
should
lose
all
i
have
got
to
live
on
the
rules
is
very
strict
and
there's
too
many
watching
for
a
vacancy
for
me
to
run
any
risks
in
the
matter
only
for
that
sir
i'd
gladly
come
here
and
attend
on
you
altogether
during
your
stay'
'my
good
woman'
said
malcolmson
hastily
'i
have
come
here
on
purpose
to
obtain
solitude
and
believe
me
that
i
am
grateful
to
the
late
greenhow
for
having
so
organised
his
admirable
charity--whatever
it
is--that
i
am
perforce
denied
the
opportunity
of
suffering
from
such
a
form
of
temptation
saint
anthony
himself
could
not
be
more
rigid
on
the
point'
the
old
woman
laughed
harshly
'ah
you
young
gentlemen'
she
said
'you
don't
fear
for
naught
and
belike
you'll
get
all
the
solitude
you
want
here'
she
set
to
work
with
her
cleaning
and
by
nightfall
when
malcolmson
returned
from
his
walk--he
always
had
one
of
his
books
to
study
as
he
walked--he
found
the
room
swept
and
tidied
a
fire
burning
in
the
old
hearth
the
lamp
lit
and
the
table
spread
for
supper
with
mrs
witham's
excellent
fare
'this
is
comfort
indeed'
he
said
as
he
rubbed
his
hands
when
he
had
finished
his
supper
and
lifted
the
tray
to
the
other
end
of
the
great
oak
dining-table
he
got
out
his
books
again
put
fresh
wood
on
the
fire
trimmed
his
lamp
and
set
himself
down
to
a
spell
of
real
hard
work
he
went
on
without
pause
till
about
eleven
o'clock
when
he
knocked
off
for
a
bit
to
fix
his
fire
and
lamp
and
to
make
himself
a
cup
of
tea
he
had
always
been
a
tea-drinker
and
during
his
college
life
had
sat
late
at
work
and
had
taken
tea
late
the
rest
was
a
great
luxury
to
him
and
he
enjoyed
it
with
a
sense
of
delicious
voluptuous
ease
the
renewed
fire
leaped
and
sparkled
and
threw
quaint
shadows
through
the
great
old
room
and
as
he
sipped
his
hot
tea
he
revelled
in
the
sense
of
isolation
from
his
kind
then
it
was
that
he
began
to
notice
for
the
first
time
what
a
noise
the
rats
were
making
'surely'
he
thought
'they
cannot
have
been
at
it
all
the
time
i
was
reading
had
they
been
i
must
have
noticed
it'
presently
when
the
noise
increased
he
satisfied
himself
that
it
was
really
new
it
was
evident
that
at
first
the
rats
had
been
frightened
at
the
presence
of
a
stranger
and
the
light
of
fire
and
lamp
but
that
as
the
time
went
on
they
had
grown
bolder
and
were
now
disporting
themselves
as
was
their
wont
how
busy
they
were
and
hark
to
the
strange
noises
up
and
down
behind
the
old
wainscot
over
the
ceiling
and
under
the
floor
they
raced
and
gnawed
and
scratched
malcolmson
smiled
to
himself
as
he
recalled
to
mind
the
saying
of
mrs
dempster
'bogies
is
rats
and
rats
is
bogies'
the
tea
began
to
have
its
effect
of
intellectual
and
nervous
stimulus
he
saw
with
joy
another
long
spell
of
work
to
be
done
before
the
night
was
past
and
in
the
sense
of
security
which
it
gave
him
he
allowed
himself
the
luxury
of
a
good
look
round
the
room
he
took
his
lamp
in
one
hand
and
went
all
around
wondering
that
so
quaint
and
beautiful
an
old
house
had
been
so
long
neglected
the
carving
of
the
oak
on
the
panels
of
the
wainscot
was
fine
and
on
and
round
the
doors
and
windows
it
was
beautiful
and
of
rare
merit
there
were
some
old
pictures
on
the
walls
but
they
were
coated
so
thick
with
dust
and
dirt
that
he
could
not
distinguish
any
detail
of
them
though
he
held
his
lamp
as
high
as
he
could
over
his
head
here
and
there
as
he
went
round
he
saw
some
crack
or
hole
blocked
for
a
moment
by
the
face
of
a
rat
with
its
bright
eyes
glittering
in
the
light
but
in
an
instant
it
was
gone
and
a
squeak
and
a
scamper
followed
the
thing
that
most
struck
him
however
was
the
rope
of
the
great
alarm
bell
on
the
roof
which
hung
down
in
a
corner
of
the
room
on
the
right-hand
side
of
the
fireplace
he
pulled
up
close
to
the
hearth
a
great
high-backed
carved
oak
chair
and
sat
down
to
his
last
cup
of
tea
when
this
was
done
he
made
up
the
fire
and
went
back
to
his
work
sitting
at
the
corner
of
the
table
having
the
fire
to
his
left
for
a
little
while
the
rats
disturbed
him
somewhat
with
their
perpetual
scampering
but
he
got
accustomed
to
the
noise
as
one
does
to
the
ticking
of
a
clock
or
to
the
roar
of
moving
water
and
he
became
so
immersed
in
his
work
that
everything
in
the
world
except
the
problem
which
he
was
trying
to
solve
passed
away
from
him
he
suddenly
looked
up
his
problem
was
still
unsolved
and
there
was
in
the
air
that
sense
of
the
hour
before
the
dawn
which
is
so
dread
to
doubtful
life
the
noise
of
the
rats
had
ceased
indeed
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
must
have
ceased
but
lately
and
that
it
was
the
sudden
cessation
which
had
disturbed
him
the
fire
had
fallen
low
but
still
it
threw
out
a
deep
red
glow
as
he
looked
he
started
in
spite
of
his
sang
froid
there
on
the
great
high-backed
carved
oak
chair
by
the
right
side
of
the
fireplace
sat
an
enormous
rat
steadily
glaring
at
him
with
baleful
eyes
he
made
a
motion
to
it
as
though
to
hunt
it
away
but
it
did
not
stir
then
he
made
the
motion
of
throwing
something
still
it
did
not
stir
but
showed
its
great
white
teeth
angrily
and
its
cruel
eyes
shone
in
the
lamplight
with
an
added
vindictiveness
malcolmson
felt
amazed
and
seizing
the
poker
from
the
hearth
ran
at
it
to
kill
it
before
however
he
could
strike
it
the
rat
with
a
squeak
that
sounded
like
the
concentration
of
hate
jumped
upon
the
floor
and
running
up
the
rope
of
the
alarm
bell
disappeared
in
the
darkness
beyond
the
range
of
the
green-shaded
lamp
instantly
strange
to
say
the
noisy
scampering
of
the
rats
in
the
wainscot
began
again
by
this
time
malcolmson's
mind
was
quite
off
the
problem
and
as
a
shrill
cock-crow
outside
told
him
of
the
approach
of
morning
he
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
he
slept
so
sound
that
he
was
not
even
waked
by
mrs
dempster
coming
in
to
make
up
his
room
it
was
only
when
she
had
tidied
up
the
place
and
got
his
breakfast
ready
and
tapped
on
the
screen
which
closed
in
his
bed
that
he
woke
he
was
a
little
tired
still
after
his
night's
hard
work
but
a
strong
cup
of
tea
soon
freshened
him
up
and
taking
his
book
he
went
out
for
his
morning
walk
bringing
with
him
a
few
sandwiches
lest
he
should
not
care
to
return
till
dinner
time
he
found
a
quiet
walk
between
high
elms
some
way
outside
the
town
and
here
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
studying
his
laplace
on
his
return
he
looked
in
to
see
mrs
witham
and
to
thank
her
for
her
kindness
when
she
saw
him
coming
through
the
diamond-paned
bay
window
of
her
sanctum
she
came
out
to
meet
him
and
asked
him
in
she
looked
at
him
searchingly
and
shook
her
head
as
she
said
'you
must
not
overdo
it
sir
you
are
paler
this
morning
than
you
should
be
too
late
hours
and
too
hard
work
on
the
brain
isn't
good
for
any
man
but
tell
me
sir
how
did
you
pass
the
night
well
i
hope
but
my
heart
sir
i
was
glad
when
mrs
dempster
told
me
this
morning
that
you
were
all
right
and
sleeping
sound
when
she
went
in'
'oh
i
was
all
right'
he
answered
smiling
'the
somethings
didn't
worry
me
as
yet
only
the
rats
and
they
had
a
circus
i
tell
you
all
over
the
place
there
was
one
wicked
looking
old
devil
that
sat
up
on
my
own
chair
by
the
fire
and
wouldn't
go
till
i
took
the
poker
to
him
and
then
he
ran
up
the
rope
of
the
alarm
bell
and
got
to
somewhere
up
the
wall
or
the
ceiling--i
couldn't
see
where
it
was
so
dark'
'mercy
on
us'
said
mrs
witham
'an
old
devil
and
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
fireside
take
care
sir
take
care
there's
many
a
true
word
spoken
in
jest'
'how
do
you
mean
pon
my
word
i
don't
understand'
'an
old
devil
the
old
devil
perhaps
there
sir
you
needn't
laugh'
for
malcolmson
had
broken
into
a
hearty
peal
'you
young
folks
thinks
it
easy
to
laugh
at
things
that
makes
older
ones
shudder
never
mind
sir
never
mind
please
god
you'll
laugh
all
the
time
it's
what
i
wish
you
myself'
and
the
good
lady
beamed
all
over
in
sympathy
with
his
enjoyment
her
fears
gone
for
a
moment
'oh
forgive
me'
said
malcolmson
presently
'don't
think
me
rude
but
the
idea
was
too
much
for
me--that
the
old
devil
himself
was
on
the
chair
last
night'
and
at
the
thought
he
laughed
again
then
he
went
home
to
dinner
this
evening
the
scampering
of
the
rats
began
earlier
indeed
it
had
been
going
on
before
his
arrival
and
only
ceased
whilst
his
presence
by
its
freshness
disturbed
them
after
dinner
he
sat
by
the
fire
for
a
while
and
had
a
smoke
and
then
having
cleared
his
table
began
to
work
as
before
tonight
the
rats
disturbed
him
more
than
they
had
done
on
the
previous
night
how
they
scampered
up
and
down
and
under
and
over
how
they
squeaked
and
scratched
and
gnawed
how
they
getting
bolder
by
degrees
came
to
the
mouths
of
their
holes
and
to
the
chinks
and
cracks
and
crannies
in
the
wainscoting
till
their
eyes
shone
like
tiny
lamps
as
the
firelight
rose
and
fell
but
to
him
now
doubtless
accustomed
to
them
their
eyes
were
not
wicked
only
their
playfulness
touched
him
sometimes
the
boldest
of
them
made
sallies
out
on
the
floor
or
along
the
mouldings
of
the
wainscot
now
and
again
as
they
disturbed
him
malcolmson
made
a
sound
to
frighten
them
smiting
the
table
with
his
hand
or
giving
a
fierce
'hsh
hsh'
so
that
they
fled
straightway
to
their
holes
and
so
the
early
part
of
the
night
wore
on
and
despite
the
noise
malcolmson
got
more
and
more
immersed
in
his
work
all
at
once
he
stopped
as
on
the
previous
night
being
overcome
by
a
sudden
sense
of
silence
there
was
not
the
faintest
sound
of
gnaw
or
scratch
or
squeak
the
silence
was
as
of
the
grave
he
remembered
the
odd
occurrence
of
the
previous
night
and
instinctively
he
looked
at
the
chair
standing
close
by
the
fireside
and
then
a
very
odd
sensation
thrilled
through
him
there
on
the
great
old
high-backed
carved
oak
chair
beside
the
fireplace
sat
the
same
enormous
rat
steadily
glaring
at
him
with
baleful
eyes
instinctively
he
took
the
nearest
thing
to
his
hand
a
book
of
logarithms
and
flung
it
at
it
the
book
was
badly
aimed
and
the
rat
did
not
stir
so
again
the
poker
performance
of
the
previous
night
was
repeated
and
again
the
rat
being
closely
pursued
fled
up
the
rope
of
the
alarm
bell
strangely
too
the
departure
of
this
rat
was
instantly
followed
by
the
renewal
of
the
noise
made
by
the
general
rat
community
on
this
occasion
as
on
the
previous
one
malcolmson
could
not
see
at
what
part
of
the
room
the
rat
disappeared
for
the
green
shade
of
his
lamp
left
the
upper
part
of
the
room
in
darkness
and
the
fire
had
burned
low
on
looking
at
his
watch
he
found
it
was
close
on
midnight
and
not
sorry
for
the
divertissement
he
made
up
his
fire
and
made
himself
his
nightly
pot
of
tea
he
had
got
through
a
good
spell
of
work
and
thought
himself
entitled
to
a
cigarette
and
so
he
sat
on
the
great
oak
chair
before
the
fire
and
enjoyed
it
whilst
smoking
he
began
to
think
that
he
would
like
to
know
where
the
rat
disappeared
to
for
he
had
certain
ideas
for
the
morrow
not
entirely
disconnected
with
a
rat-trap
accordingly
he
lit
another
lamp
and
placed
it
so
that
it
would
shine
well
into
the
right-hand
corner
of
the
wall
by
the
fireplace
then
he
got
all
the
books
he
had
with
him
and
placed
them
handy
to
throw
at
the
vermin
finally
he
lifted
the
rope
of
the
alarm
bell
and
placed
the
end
of
it
on
the
table
fixing
the
extreme
end
under
the
lamp
as
he
handled
it
he
could
not
help
noticing
how
pliable
it
was
especially
for
so
strong
a
rope
and
one
not
in
use
'you
could
hang
a
man
with
it'
he
thought
to
himself
when
his
preparations
were
made
he
looked
around
and
said
complacently
'there
now
my
friend
i
think
we
shall
learn
something
of
you
this
time'
he
began
his
work
again
and
though
as
before
somewhat
disturbed
at
first
by
the
noise
of
the
rats
soon
lost
himself
in
his
propositions
and
problems
again
he
was
called
to
his
immediate
surroundings
suddenly
this
time
it
might
not
have
been
the
sudden
silence
only
which
took
his
attention
there
was
a
slight
movement
of
the
rope
and
the
lamp
moved
without
stirring
he
looked
to
see
if
his
pile
of
books
was
within
range
and
then
cast
his
eye
along
the
rope
as
he
looked
he
saw
the
great
rat
drop
from
the
rope
on
the
oak
arm-chair
and
sit
there
glaring
at
him
he
raised
a
book
in
his
right
hand
and
taking
careful
aim
flung
it
at
the
rat
the
latter
with
a
quick
movement
sprang
aside
and
dodged
the
missile
he
then
took
another
book
and
a
third
and
flung
them
one
after
another
at
the
rat
but
each
time
unsuccessfully
at
last
as
he
stood
with
a
book
poised
in
his
hand
to
throw
the
rat
squeaked
and
seemed
afraid
this
made
malcolmson
more
than
ever
eager
to
strike
and
the
book
flew
and
struck
the
rat
a
resounding
blow
it
gave
a
terrified
squeak
and
turning
on
his
pursuer
a
look
of
terrible
malevolence
ran
up
the
chair-back
and
made
a
great
jump
to
the
rope
of
the
alarm
bell
and
ran
up
it
like
lightning
the
lamp
rocked
under
the
sudden
strain
but
it
was
a
heavy
one
and
did
not
topple
over
malcolmson
kept
his
eyes
on
the
rat
and
saw
it
by
the
light
of
the
second
lamp
leap
to
a
moulding
of
the
wainscot
and
disappear
through
a
hole
in
one
of
the
great
pictures
which
hung
on
the
wall
obscured
and
invisible
through
its
coating
of
dirt
and
dust
'i
shall
look
up
my
friend's
habitation
in
the
morning'
said
the
student
as
he
went
over
to
collect
his
books
'the
third
picture
from
the
fireplace
i
shall
not
forget'
he
picked
up
the
books
one
by
one
commenting
on
them
as
he
lifted
them
'conic
sections
he
does
not
mind
nor
cycloidal
oscillations
nor
the
principia
nor
quaternions
nor
thermodynamics
now
for
the
book
that
fetched
him'
malcolmson
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
as
he
did
so
he
started
and
a
sudden
pallor
overspread
his
face
he
looked
round
uneasily
and
shivered
slightly
as
he
murmured
to
himself
'the
bible
my
mother
gave
me
what
an
odd
coincidence'
he
sat
down
to
work
again
and
the
rats
in
the
wainscot
renewed
their
gambols
they
did
not
disturb
him
however
somehow
their
presence
gave
him
a
sense
of
companionship
but
he
could
not
attend
to
his
work
and
after
striving
to
master
the
subject
on
which
he
was
engaged
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
went
to
bed
as
the
first
streak
of
dawn
stole
in
through
the
eastern
window
he
slept
heavily
but
uneasily
and
dreamed
much
and
when
mrs
dempster
woke
him
late
in
the
morning
he
seemed
ill
at
ease
and
for
a
few
minutes
did
not
seem
to
realise
exactly
where
he
was
his
first
request
rather
surprised
the
servant
'mrs
dempster
when
i
am
out
to-day
i
wish
you
would
get
the
steps
and
dust
or
wash
those
pictures--specially
that
one
the
third
from
the
fireplace--i
want
to
see
what
they
are'
late
in
the
afternoon
malcolmson
worked
at
his
books
in
the
shaded
walk
and
the
cheerfulness
of
the
previous
day
came
back
to
him
as
the
day
wore
on
and
he
found
that
his
reading
was
progressing
well
he
had
worked
out
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
all
the
problems
which
had
as
yet
baffled
him
and
it
was
in
a
state
of
jubilation
that
he
paid
a
visit
to
mrs
witham
at
'the
good
traveller'
he
found
a
stranger
in
the
cosy
sitting-room
with
the
landlady
who
was
introduced
to
him
as
dr
thornhill
she
was
not
quite
at
ease
and
this
combined
with
the
doctor's
plunging
at
once
into
a
series
of
questions
made
malcolmson
come
to
the
conclusion
that
his
presence
was
not
an
accident
so
without
preliminary
he
said
'dr
thornhill
i
shall
with
pleasure
answer
you
any
question
you
may
choose
to
ask
me
if
you
will
answer
me
one
question
first'
the
doctor
seemed
surprised
but
he
smiled
and
answered
at
once
'done
what
is
it'
'did
mrs
witham
ask
you
to
come
here
and
see
me
and
advise
me'
dr
thornhill
for
a
moment
was
taken
aback
and
mrs
witham
got
fiery
red
and
turned
away
but
the
doctor
was
a
frank
and
ready
man
and
he
answered
at
once
and
openly
'she
did
but
she
didn't
intend
you
to
know
it
i
suppose
it
was
my
clumsy
haste
that
made
you
suspect
she
told
me
that
she
did
not
like
the
idea
of
your
being
in
that
house
all
by
yourself
and
that
she
thought
you
took
too
much
strong
tea
in
fact
she
wants
me
to
advise
you
if
possible
to
give
up
the
tea
and
the
very
late
hours
i
was
a
keen
student
in
my
time
so
i
suppose
i
may
take
the
liberty
of
a
college
man
and
without
offence
advise
you
not
quite
as
a
stranger'
malcolmson
with
a
bright
smile
held
out
his
hand
'shake
as
they
say
in
america'
he
said
'i
must
thank
you
for
your
kindness
and
mrs
witham
too
and
your
kindness
deserves
a
return
on
my
part
i
promise
to
take
no
more
strong
tea--no
tea
at
all
till
you
let
me--and
i
shall
go
to
bed
tonight
at
one
o'clock
at
latest
will
that
do'
'capital'
said
the
doctor
'now
tell
us
all
that
you
noticed
in
the
old
house'
and
so
malcolmson
then
and
there
told
in
minute
detail
all
that
had
happened
in
the
last
two
nights
he
was
interrupted
every
now
and
then
by
some
exclamation
from
mrs
witham
till
finally
when
he
told
of
the
episode
of
the
bible
the
landlady's
pent-up
emotions
found
vent
in
a
shriek
and
it
was
not
till
a
stiff
glass
of
brandy
and
water
had
been
administered
that
she
grew
composed
again
dr
thornhill
listened
with
a
face
of
growing
gravity
and
when
the
narrative
was
complete
and
mrs
witham
had
been
restored
he
asked
'the
rat
always
went
up
the
rope
of
the
alarm
bell'
'always'
'i
suppose
you
know'
said
the
doctor
after
a
pause
'what
the
rope
is'
'no'
'it
is'
said
the
doctor
slowly
'the
very
rope
which
the
hangman
used
for
all
the
victims
of
the
judge's
judicial
rancour'
here
he
was
interrupted
by
another
scream
from
mrs
witham
and
steps
had
to
be
taken
for
her
recovery
malcolmson
having
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
that
it
was
close
to
his
dinner
hour
had
gone
home
before
her
complete
recovery
when
mrs
witham
was
herself
again
she
almost
assailed
the
doctor
with
angry
questions
as
to
what
he
meant
by
putting
such
horrible
ideas
into
the
poor
young
man's
mind
'he
has
quite
enough
there
already
to
upset
him'
she
added
dr
thornhill
replied
'my
dear
madam
i
had
a
distinct
purpose
in
it
i
wanted
to
draw
his
attention
to
the
bell
rope
and
to
fix
it
there
it
may
be
that
he
is
in
a
highly
overwrought
state
and
has
been
studying
too
much
although
i
am
bound
to
say
that
he
seems
as
sound
and
healthy
a
young
man
mentally
and
bodily
as
ever
i
saw--but
then
the
rats--and
that
suggestion
of
the
devil'
the
doctor
shook
his
head
and
went
on
'i
would
have
offered
to
go
and
stay
the
first
night
with
him
but
that
i
felt
sure
it
would
have
been
a
cause
of
offence
he
may
get
in
the
night
some
strange
fright
or
hallucination
and
if
he
does
i
want
him
to
pull
that
rope
all
alone
as
he
is
it
will
give
us
warning
and
we
may
reach
him
in
time
to
be
of
service
i
shall
be
sitting
up
pretty
late
tonight
and
shall
keep
my
ears
open
do
not
be
alarmed
if
benchurch
gets
a
surprise
before
morning'
'oh
doctor
what
do
you
mean
what
do
you
mean'
'i
mean
this
that
possibly--nay
more
probably--we
shall
hear
the
great
alarm
bell
from
the
judge's
house
tonight'
and
the
doctor
made
about
as
effective
an
exit
as
could
be
thought
of
when
malcolmson
arrived
home
he
found
that
it
was
a
little
after
his
usual
time
and
mrs
dempster
had
gone
away--the
rules
of
greenhow's
charity
were
not
to
be
neglected
he
was
glad
to
see
that
the
place
was
bright
and
tidy
with
a
cheerful
fire
and
a
well-trimmed
lamp
the
evening
was
colder
than
might
have
been
expected
in
april
and
a
heavy
wind
was
blowing
with
such
rapidly-increasing
strength
that
there
was
every
promise
of
a
storm
during
the
night
for
a
few
minutes
after
his
entrance
the
noise
of
the
rats
ceased
but
so
soon
as
they
became
accustomed
to
his
presence
they
began
again
he
was
glad
to
hear
them
for
he
felt
once
more
the
feeling
of
companionship
in
their
noise
and
his
mind
ran
back
to
the
strange
fact
that
they
only
ceased
to
manifest
themselves
when
that
other--the
great
rat
with
the
baleful
eyes--came
upon
the
scene
the
reading-lamp
only
was
lit
and
its
green
shade
kept
the
ceiling
and
the
upper
part
of
the
room
in
darkness
so
that
the
cheerful
light
from
the
hearth
spreading
over
the
floor
and
shining
on
the
white
cloth
laid
over
the
end
of
the
table
was
warm
and
cheery
malcolmson
sat
down
to
his
dinner
with
a
good
appetite
and
a
buoyant
spirit
after
his
dinner
and
a
cigarette
he
sat
steadily
down
to
work
determined
not
to
let
anything
disturb
him
for
he
remembered
his
promise
to
the
doctor
and
made
up
his
mind
to
make
the
best
of
the
time
at
his
disposal
for
an
hour
or
so
he
worked
all
right
and
then
his
thoughts
began
to
wander
from
his
books
the
actual
circumstances
around
him
the
calls
on
his
physical
attention
and
his
nervous
susceptibility
were
not
to
be
denied
by
this
time
the
wind
had
become
a
gale
and
the
gale
a
storm
the
old
house
solid
though
it
was
seemed
to
shake
to
its
foundations
and
the
storm
roared
and
raged
through
its
many
chimneys
and
its
queer
old
gables
producing
strange
unearthly
sounds
in
the
empty
rooms
and
corridors
even
the
great
alarm
bell
on
the
roof
must
have
felt
the
force
of
the
wind
for
the
rope
rose
and
fell
slightly
as
though
the
bell
were
moved
a
little
from
time
to
time
and
the
limber
rope
fell
on
the
oak
floor
with
a
hard
and
hollow
sound
as
malcolmson
listened
to
it
he
bethought
himself
of
the
doctor's
words
'it
is
the
rope
which
the
hangman
used
for
the
victims
of
the
judge's
judicial
rancour'
and
he
went
over
to
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
and
took
it
in
his
hand
to
look
at
it
there
seemed
a
sort
of
deadly
interest
in
it
and
as
he
stood
there
he
lost
himself
for
a
moment
in
speculation
as
to
who
these
victims
were
and
the
grim
wish
of
the
judge
to
have
such
a
ghastly
relic
ever
under
his
eyes
as
he
stood
there
the
swaying
of
the
bell
on
the
roof
still
lifted
the
rope
now
and
again
but
presently
there
came
a
new
sensation--a
sort
of
tremor
in
the
rope
as
though
something
was
moving
along
it
looking
up
instinctively
malcolmson
saw
the
great
rat
coming
slowly
down
towards
him
glaring
at
him
steadily
he
dropped
the
rope
and
started
back
with
a
muttered
curse
and
the
rat
turning
ran
up
the
rope
again
and
disappeared
and
at
the
same
instant
malcolmson
became
conscious
that
the
noise
of
the
rats
which
had
ceased
for
a
while
began
again
all
this
set
him
thinking
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
not
investigated
the
lair
of
the
rat
or
looked
at
the
pictures
as
he
had
intended
he
lit
the
other
lamp
without
the
shade
and
holding
it
up
went
and
stood
opposite
the
third
picture
from
the
fireplace
on
the
right-hand
side
where
he
had
seen
the
rat
disappear
on
the
previous
night
at
the
first
glance
he
started
back
so
suddenly
that
he
almost
dropped
the
lamp
and
a
deadly
pallor
overspread
his
face
his
knees
shook
and
heavy
drops
of
sweat
came
on
his
forehead
and
he
trembled
like
an
aspen
but
he
was
young
and
plucky
and
pulled
himself
together
and
after
the
pause
of
a
few
seconds
stepped
forward
again
raised
the
lamp
and
examined
the
picture
which
had
been
dusted
and
washed
and
now
stood
out
clearly
it
was
of
a
judge
dressed
in
his
robes
of
scarlet
and
ermine
his
face
was
strong
and
merciless
evil
crafty
and
vindictive
with
a
sensual
mouth
hooked
nose
of
ruddy
colour
and
shaped
like
the
beak
of
a
bird
of
prey
the
rest
of
the
face
was
of
a
cadaverous
colour
the
eyes
were
of
peculiar
brilliance
and
with
a
terribly
malignant
expression
as
he
looked
at
them
malcolmson
grew
cold
for
he
saw
there
the
very
counterpart
of
the
eyes
of
the
great
rat
the
lamp
almost
fell
from
his
hand
he
saw
the
rat
with
its
baleful
eyes
peering
out
through
the
hole
in
the
corner
of
the
picture
and
noted
the
sudden
cessation
of
the
noise
of
the
other
rats
however
he
pulled
himself
together
and
went
on
with
his
examination
of
the
picture
the
judge
was
seated
in
a
great
high-backed
carved
oak
chair
on
the
right-hand
side
of
a
great
stone
fireplace
where
in
the
corner
a
rope
hung
down
from
the
ceiling
its
end
lying
coiled
on
the
floor
with
a
feeling
of
something
like
horror
malcolmson
recognised
the
scene
of
the
room
as
it
stood
and
gazed
around
him
in
an
awestruck
manner
as
though
he
expected
to
find
some
strange
presence
behind
him
then
he
looked
over
to
the
corner
of
the
fireplace--and
with
a
loud
cry
he
let
the
lamp
fall
from
his
hand
there
in
the
judge's
arm-chair
with
the
rope
hanging
behind
sat
the
rat
with
the
judge's
baleful
eyes
now
intensified
and
with
a
fiendish
leer
save
for
the
howling
of
the
storm
without
there
was
silence
the
fallen
lamp
recalled
malcolmson
to
himself
fortunately
it
was
of
metal
and
so
the
oil
was
not
spilt
however
the
practical
need
of
attending
to
it
settled
at
once
his
nervous
apprehensions
when
he
had
turned
it
out
he
wiped
his
brow
and
thought
for
a
moment
'this
will
not
do'
he
said
to
himself
'if
i
go
on
like
this
i
shall
become
a
crazy
fool
this
must
stop
i
promised
the
doctor
i
would
not
take
tea
faith
he
was
pretty
right
my
nerves
must
have
been
getting
into
a
queer
state
funny
i
did
not
notice
it
i
never
felt
better
in
my
life
however
it
is
all
right
now
and
i
shall
not
be
such
a
fool
again'
then
he
mixed
himself
a
good
stiff
glass
of
brandy
and
water
and
resolutely
sat
down
to
his
work
it
was
nearly
an
hour
when
he
looked
up
from
his
book
disturbed
by
the
sudden
stillness
without
the
wind
howled
and
roared
louder
than
ever
and
the
rain
drove
in
sheets
against
the
windows
beating
like
hail
on
the
glass
but
within
there
was
no
sound
whatever
save
the
echo
of
the
wind
as
it
roared
in
the
great
chimney
and
now
and
then
a
hiss
as
a
few
raindrops
found
their
way
down
the
chimney
in
a
lull
of
the
storm
the
fire
had
fallen
low
and
had
ceased
to
flame
though
it
threw
out
a
red
glow
malcolmson
listened
attentively
and
presently
heard
a
thin
squeaking
noise
very
faint
it
came
from
the
corner
of
the
room
where
the
rope
hung
down
and
he
thought
it
was
the
creaking
of
the
rope
on
the
floor
as
the
swaying
of
the
bell
raised
and
lowered
it
looking
up
however
he
saw
in
the
dim
light
the
great
rat
clinging
to
the
rope
and
gnawing
it
the
rope
was
already
nearly
gnawed
through--he
could
see
the
lighter
colour
where
the
strands
were
laid
bare
as
he
looked
the
job
was
completed
and
the
severed
end
of
the
rope
fell
clattering
on
the
oaken
floor
whilst
for
an
instant
the
great
rat
remained
like
a
knob
or
tassel
at
the
end
of
the
rope
which
now
began
to
sway
to
and
fro
malcolmson
felt
for
a
moment
another
pang
of
terror
as
he
thought
that
now
the
possibility
of
calling
the
outer
world
to
his
assistance
was
cut
off
but
an
intense
anger
took
its
place
and
seizing
the
book
he
was
reading
he
hurled
it
at
the
rat
the
blow
was
well
aimed
but
before
the
missile
could
reach
him
the
rat
dropped
off
and
struck
the
floor
with
a
soft
thud
malcolmson
instantly
rushed
over
towards
him
but
it
darted
away
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
the
shadows
of
the
room
malcolmson
felt
that
his
work
was
over
for
the
night
and
determined
then
and
there
to
vary
the
monotony
of
the
proceedings
by
a
hunt
for
the
rat
and
took
off
the
green
shade
of
the
lamp
so
as
to
insure
a
wider
spreading
light
as
he
did
so
the
gloom
of
the
upper
part
of
the
room
was
relieved
and
in
the
new
flood
of
light
great
by
comparison
with
the
previous
darkness
the
pictures
on
the
wall
stood
out
boldly
from
where
he
stood
malcolmson
saw
right
opposite
to
him
the
third
picture
on
the
wall
from
the
right
of
the
fireplace
he
rubbed
his
eyes
in
surprise
and
then
a
great
fear
began
to
come
upon
him
in
the
centre
of
the
picture
was
a
great
irregular
patch
of
brown
canvas
as
fresh
as
when
it
was
stretched
on
the
frame
the
background
was
as
before
with
chair
and
chimney-corner
and
rope
but
the
figure
of
the
judge
had
disappeared
malcolmson
almost
in
a
chill
of
horror
turned
slowly
round
and
then
he
began
to
shake
and
tremble
like
a
man
in
a
palsy
his
strength
seemed
to
have
left
him
and
he
was
incapable
of
action
or
movement
hardly
even
of
thought
he
could
only
see
and
hear
there
on
the
great
high-backed
carved
oak
chair
sat
the
judge
in
his
robes
of
scarlet
and
ermine
with
his
baleful
eyes
glaring
vindictively
and
a
smile
of
triumph
on
the
resolute
cruel
mouth
as
he
lifted
with
his
hands
a
black
cap
malcolmson
felt
as
if
the
blood
was
running
from
his
heart
as
one
does
in
moments
of
prolonged
suspense
there
was
a
singing
in
his
ears
without
he
could
hear
the
roar
and
howl
of
the
tempest
and
through
it
swept
on
the
storm
came
the
striking
of
midnight
by
the
great
chimes
in
the
market
place
he
stood
for
a
space
of
time
that
seemed
to
him
endless
still
as
a
statue
and
with
wide-open
horror-struck
eyes
breathless
as
the
clock
struck
so
the
smile
of
triumph
on
the
judge's
face
intensified
and
at
the
last
stroke
of
midnight
he
placed
the
black
cap
on
his
head
slowly
and
deliberately
the
judge
rose
from
his
chair
and
picked
up
the
piece
of
the
rope
of
the
alarm
bell
which
lay
on
the
floor
drew
it
through
his
hands
as
if
he
enjoyed
its
touch
and
then
deliberately
began
to
knot
one
end
of
it
fashioning
it
into
a
noose
this
he
tightened
and
tested
with
his
foot
pulling
hard
at
it
till
he
was
satisfied
and
then
making
a
running
noose
of
it
which
he
held
in
his
hand
then
he
began
to
move
along
the
table
on
the
opposite
side
to
malcolmson
keeping
his
eyes
on
him
until
he
had
passed
him
when
with
a
quick
movement
he
stood
in
front
of
the
door
malcolmson
then
began
to
feel
that
he
was
trapped
and
tried
to
think
of
what
he
should
do
there
was
some
fascination
in
the
judge's
eyes
which
he
never
took
off
him
and
he
had
perforce
to
look
he
saw
the
judge
approach--still
keeping
between
him
and
the
door--and
raise
the
noose
and
throw
it
towards
him
as
if
to
entangle
him
with
a
great
effort
he
made
a
quick
movement
to
one
side
and
saw
the
rope
fall
beside
him
and
heard
it
strike
the
oaken
floor
again
the
judge
raised
the
noose
and
tried
to
ensnare
him
ever
keeping
his
baleful
eyes
fixed
on
him
and
each
time
by
a
mighty
effort
the
student
just
managed
to
evade
it
so
this
went
on
for
many
times
the
judge
seeming
never
discouraged
nor
discomposed
at
failure
but
playing
as
a
cat
does
with
a
mouse
at
last
in
despair
which
had
reached
its
climax
malcolmson
cast
a
quick
glance
round
him
the
lamp
seemed
to
have
blazed
up
and
there
was
a
fairly
good
light
in
the
room
at
the
many
rat-holes
and
in
the
chinks
and
crannies
of
the
wainscot
he
saw
the
rats'
eyes
and
this
aspect
that
was
purely
physical
gave
him
a
gleam
of
comfort
he
looked
around
and
saw
that
the
rope
of
the
great
alarm
bell
was
laden
with
rats
every
inch
of
it
was
covered
with
them
and
more
and
more
were
pouring
through
the
small
circular
hole
in
the
ceiling
whence
it
emerged
so
that
with
their
weight
the
bell
was
beginning
to
sway
hark
it
had
swayed
till
the
clapper
had
touched
the
bell
the
sound
was
but
a
tiny
one
but
the
bell
was
only
beginning
to
sway
and
it
would
increase
at
the
sound
the
judge
who
had
been
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
malcolmson
looked
up
and
a
scowl
of
diabolical
anger
overspread
his
face
his
eyes
fairly
glowed
like
hot
coals
and
he
stamped
his
foot
with
a
sound
that
seemed
to
make
the
house
shake
a
dreadful
peal
of
thunder
broke
overhead
as
he
raised
the
rope
again
whilst
the
rats
kept
running
up
and
down
the
rope
as
though
working
against
time
this
time
instead
of
throwing
it
he
drew
close
to
his
victim
and
held
open
the
noose
as
he
approached
as
he
came
closer
there
seemed
something
paralysing
in
his
very
presence
and
malcolmson
stood
rigid
as
a
corpse
he
felt
the
judge's
icy
fingers
touch
his
throat
as
he
adjusted
the
rope
the
noose
tightened--tightened
then
the
judge
taking
the
rigid
form
of
the
student
in
his
arms
carried
him
over
and
placed
him
standing
in
the
oak
chair
and
stepping
up
beside
him
put
his
hand
up
and
caught
the
end
of
the
swaying
rope
of
the
alarm
bell
as
he
raised
his
hand
the
rats
fled
squeaking
and
disappeared
through
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
taking
the
end
of
the
noose
which
was
round
malcolmson's
neck
he
tied
it
to
the
hanging-bell
rope
and
then
descending
pulled
away
the
chair





when
the
alarm
bell
of
the
judge's
house
began
to
sound
a
crowd
soon
assembled
lights
and
torches
of
various
kinds
appeared
and
soon
a
silent
crowd
was
hurrying
to
the
spot
they
knocked
loudly
at
the
door
but
there
was
no
reply
then
they
burst
in
the
door
and
poured
into
the
great
dining-room
the
doctor
at
the
head
there
at
the
end
of
the
rope
of
the
great
alarm
bell
hung
the
body
of
the
student
and
on
the
face
of
the
judge
in
the
picture
was
a
malignant
smile
the
squaw
nurnberg
at
the
time
was
not
so
much
exploited
as
it
has
been
since
then
irving
had
not
been
playing
faust
and
the
very
name
of
the
old
town
was
hardly
known
to
the
great
bulk
of
the
travelling
public
my
wife
and
i
being
in
the
second
week
of
our
honeymoon
naturally
wanted
someone
else
to
join
our
party
so
that
when
the
cheery
stranger
elias
p
hutcheson
hailing
from
isthmian
city
bleeding
gulch
maple
tree
county
neb
turned
up
at
the
station
at
frankfort
and
casually
remarked
that
he
was
going
on
to
see
the
most
all-fired
old
methuselah
of
a
town
in
yurrup
and
that
he
guessed
that
so
much
travelling
alone
was
enough
to
send
an
intelligent
active
citizen
into
the
melancholy
ward
of
a
daft
house
we
took
the
pretty
broad
hint
and
suggested
that
we
should
join
forces
we
found
on
comparing
notes
afterwards
that
we
had
each
intended
to
speak
with
some
diffidence
or
hesitation
so
as
not
to
appear
too
eager
such
not
being
a
good
compliment
to
the
success
of
our
married
life
but
the
effect
was
entirely
marred
by
our
both
beginning
to
speak
at
the
same
instant--stopping
simultaneously
and
then
going
on
together
again
anyhow
no
matter
how
it
was
done
and
elias
p
hutcheson
became
one
of
our
party
straightway
amelia
and
i
found
the
pleasant
benefit
instead
of
quarrelling
as
we
had
been
doing
we
found
that
the
restraining
influence
of
a
third
party
was
such
that
we
now
took
every
opportunity
of
spooning
in
odd
corners
amelia
declares
that
ever
since
she
has
as
the
result
of
that
experience
advised
all
her
friends
to
take
a
friend
on
the
honeymoon
well
we
'did'
nurnberg
together
and
much
enjoyed
the
racy
remarks
of
our
transatlantic
friend
who
from
his
quaint
speech
and
his
wonderful
stock
of
adventures
might
have
stepped
out
of
a
novel
we
kept
for
the
last
object
of
interest
in
the
city
to
be
visited
the
burg
and
on
the
day
appointed
for
the
visit
strolled
round
the
outer
wall
of
the
city
by
the
eastern
side
the
burg
is
seated
on
a
rock
dominating
the
town
and
an
immensely
deep
fosse
guards
it
on
the
northern
side
nurnberg
has
been
happy
in
that
it
was
never
sacked
had
it
been
it
would
certainly
not
be
so
spick
and
span
perfect
as
it
is
at
present
the
ditch
has
not
been
used
for
centuries
and
now
its
base
is
spread
with
tea-gardens
and
orchards
of
which
some
of
the
trees
are
of
quite
respectable
growth
as
we
wandered
round
the
wall
dawdling
in
the
hot
july
sunshine
we
often
paused
to
admire
the
views
spread
before
us
and
in
especial
the
great
plain
covered
with
towns
and
villages
and
bounded
with
a
blue
line
of
hills
like
a
landscape
of
claude
lorraine
from
this
we
always
turned
with
new
delight
to
the
city
itself
with
its
myriad
of
quaint
old
gables
and
acre-wide
red
roofs
dotted
with
dormer
windows
tier
upon
tier
a
little
to
our
right
rose
the
towers
of
the
burg
and
nearer
still
standing
grim
the
torture
tower
which
was
and
is
perhaps
the
most
interesting
place
in
the
city
for
centuries
the
tradition
of
the
iron
virgin
of
nurnberg
has
been
handed
down
as
an
instance
of
the
horrors
of
cruelty
of
which
man
is
capable
we
had
long
looked
forward
to
seeing
it
and
here
at
last
was
its
home
in
one
of
our
pauses
we
leaned
over
the
wall
of
the
moat
and
looked
down
the
garden
seemed
quite
fifty
or
sixty
feet
below
us
and
the
sun
pouring
into
it
with
an
intense
moveless
heat
like
that
of
an
oven
beyond
rose
the
grey
grim
wall
seemingly
of
endless
height
and
losing
itself
right
and
left
in
the
angles
of
bastion
and
counterscarp
trees
and
bushes
crowned
the
wall
and
above
again
towered
the
lofty
houses
on
whose
massive
beauty
time
has
only
set
the
hand
of
approval
the
sun
was
hot
and
we
were
lazy
time
was
our
own
and
we
lingered
leaning
on
the
wall
just
below
us
was
a
pretty
sight--a
great
black
cat
lying
stretched
in
the
sun
whilst
round
her
gambolled
prettily
a
tiny
black
kitten
the
mother
would
wave
her
tail
for
the
kitten
to
play
with
or
would
raise
her
feet
and
push
away
the
little
one
as
an
encouragement
to
further
play
they
were
just
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
elias
p
hutcheson
in
order
to
help
the
play
stooped
and
took
from
the
walk
a
moderate
sized
pebble
'see'
he
said
'i
will
drop
it
near
the
kitten
and
they
will
both
wonder
where
it
came
from'
'oh
be
careful'
said
my
wife
'you
might
hit
the
dear
little
thing'
'not
me
ma'am'
said
elias
p
'why
i'm
as
tender
as
a
maine
cherry-tree
lor
bless
ye
i
wouldn't
hurt
the
poor
pooty
little
critter
more'n
i'd
scalp
a
baby
an'
you
may
bet
your
variegated
socks
on
that
see
i'll
drop
it
fur
away
on
the
outside
so's
not
to
go
near
her'
thus
saying
he
leaned
over
and
held
his
arm
out
at
full
length
and
dropped
the
stone
it
may
be
that
there
is
some
attractive
force
which
draws
lesser
matters
to
greater
or
more
probably
that
the
wall
was
not
plump
but
sloped
to
its
base--we
not
noticing
the
inclination
from
above
but
the
stone
fell
with
a
sickening
thud
that
came
up
to
us
through
the
hot
air
right
on
the
kitten's
head
and
shattered
out
its
little
brains
then
and
there
the
black
cat
cast
a
swift
upward
glance
and
we
saw
her
eyes
like
green
fire
fixed
an
instant
on
elias
p
hutcheson
and
then
her
attention
was
given
to
the
kitten
which
lay
still
with
just
a
quiver
of
her
tiny
limbs
whilst
a
thin
red
stream
trickled
from
a
gaping
wound
with
a
muffled
cry
such
as
a
human
being
might
give
she
bent
over
the
kitten
licking
its
wounds
and
moaning
suddenly
she
seemed
to
realise
that
it
was
dead
and
again
threw
her
eyes
up
at
us
i
shall
never
forget
the
sight
for
she
looked
the
perfect
incarnation
of
hate
her
green
eyes
blazed
with
lurid
fire
and
the
white
sharp
teeth
seemed
to
almost
shine
through
the
blood
which
dabbled
her
mouth
and
whiskers
she
gnashed
her
teeth
and
her
claws
stood
out
stark
and
at
full
length
on
every
paw
then
she
made
a
wild
rush
up
the
wall
as
if
to
reach
us
but
when
the
momentum
ended
fell
back
and
further
added
to
her
horrible
appearance
for
she
fell
on
the
kitten
and
rose
with
her
black
fur
smeared
with
its
brains
and
blood
amelia
turned
quite
faint
and
i
had
to
lift
her
back
from
the
wall
there
was
a
seat
close
by
in
shade
of
a
spreading
plane-tree
and
here
i
placed
her
whilst
she
composed
herself
then
i
went
back
to
hutcheson
who
stood
without
moving
looking
down
on
the
angry
cat
below
as
i
joined
him
he
said
'wall
i
guess
that
air
the
savagest
beast
i
ever
see--'cept
once
when
an
apache
squaw
had
an
edge
on
a
half-breed
what
they
nicknamed
splinters
'cos
of
the
way
he
fixed
up
her
papoose
which
he
stole
on
a
raid
just
to
show
that
he
appreciated
the
way
they
had
given
his
mother
the
fire
torture
she
got
that
kinder
look
so
set
on
her
face
that
it
jest
seemed
to
grow
there
she
followed
splinters
mor'n
three
year
till
at
last
the
braves
got
him
and
handed
him
over
to
her
they
did
say
that
no
man
white
or
injun
had
ever
been
so
long
a-dying
under
the
tortures
of
the
apaches
the
only
time
i
ever
see
her
smile
was
when
i
wiped
her
out
i
kem
on
the
camp
just
in
time
to
see
splinters
pass
in
his
checks
and
he
wasn't
sorry
to
go
either
he
was
a
hard
citizen
and
though
i
never
could
shake
with
him
after
that
papoose
business--for
it
was
bitter
bad
and
he
should
have
been
a
white
man
for
he
looked
like
one--i
see
he
had
got
paid
out
in
full
durn
me
but
i
took
a
piece
of
his
hide
from
one
of
his
skinnin'
posts
an'
had
it
made
into
a
pocket-book
it's
here
now'
and
he
slapped
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
whilst
he
was
speaking
the
cat
was
continuing
her
frantic
efforts
to
get
up
the
wall
she
would
take
a
run
back
and
then
charge
up
sometimes
reaching
an
incredible
height
she
did
not
seem
to
mind
the
heavy
fall
which
she
got
each
time
but
started
with
renewed
vigour
and
at
every
tumble
her
appearance
became
more
horrible
hutcheson
was
a
kind-hearted
man--my
wife
and
i
had
both
noticed
little
acts
of
kindness
to
animals
as
well
as
to
persons--and
he
seemed
concerned
at
the
state
of
fury
to
which
the
cat
had
wrought
herself
'wall
now'
he
said
'i
du
declare
that
that
poor
critter
seems
quite
desperate
there
there
poor
thing
it
was
all
an
accident--though
that
won't
bring
back
your
little
one
to
you
say
i
wouldn't
have
had
such
a
thing
happen
for
a
thousand
just
shows
what
a
clumsy
fool
of
a
man
can
do
when
he
tries
to
play
seems
i'm
too
darned
slipperhanded
to
even
play
with
a
cat
say
colonel'
it
was
a
pleasant
way
he
had
to
bestow
titles
freely--'i
hope
your
wife
don't
hold
no
grudge
against
me
on
account
of
this
unpleasantness
why
i
wouldn't
have
had
it
occur
on
no
account'
he
came
over
to
amelia
and
apologised
profusely
and
she
with
her
usual
kindness
of
heart
hastened
to
assure
him
that
she
quite
understood
that
it
was
an
accident
then
we
all
went
again
to
the
wall
and
looked
over
the
cat
missing
hutcheson's
face
had
drawn
back
across
the
moat
and
was
sitting
on
her
haunches
as
though
ready
to
spring
indeed
the
very
instant
she
saw
him
she
did
spring
and
with
a
blind
unreasoning
fury
which
would
have
been
grotesque
only
that
it
was
so
frightfully
real
she
did
not
try
to
run
up
the
wall
but
simply
launched
herself
at
him
as
though
hate
and
fury
could
lend
her
wings
to
pass
straight
through
the
great
distance
between
them
amelia
womanlike
got
quite
concerned
and
said
to
elias
p
in
a
warning
voice
'oh
you
must
be
very
careful
that
animal
would
try
to
kill
you
if
she
were
here
her
eyes
look
like
positive
murder'
he
laughed
out
jovially
'excuse
me
ma'am'
he
said
'but
i
can't
help
laughin'
fancy
a
man
that
has
fought
grizzlies
an'
injuns
bein'
careful
of
bein'
murdered
by
a
cat'
when
the
cat
heard
him
laugh
her
whole
demeanour
seemed
to
change
she
no
longer
tried
to
jump
or
run
up
the
wall
but
went
quietly
over
and
sitting
again
beside
the
dead
kitten
began
to
lick
and
fondle
it
as
though
it
were
alive
'see'
said
i
'the
effect
of
a
really
strong
man
even
that
animal
in
the
midst
of
her
fury
recognises
the
voice
of
a
master
and
bows
to
him'
'like
a
squaw'
was
the
only
comment
of
elias
p
hutcheson
as
we
moved
on
our
way
round
the
city
fosse
every
now
and
then
we
looked
over
the
wall
and
each
time
saw
the
cat
following
us
at
first
she
had
kept
going
back
to
the
dead
kitten
and
then
as
the
distance
grew
greater
took
it
in
her
mouth
and
so
followed
after
a
while
however
she
abandoned
this
for
we
saw
her
following
all
alone
she
had
evidently
hidden
the
body
somewhere
amelia's
alarm
grew
at
the
cat's
persistence
and
more
than
once
she
repeated
her
warning
but
the
american
always
laughed
with
amusement
till
finally
seeing
that
she
was
beginning
to
be
worried
he
said
'i
say
ma'am
you
needn't
be
skeered
over
that
cat
i
go
heeled
i
du'
here
he
slapped
his
pistol
pocket
at
the
back
of
his
lumbar
region
'why
sooner'n
have
you
worried
i'll
shoot
the
critter
right
here
an'
risk
the
police
interferin'
with
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
for
carryin'
arms
contrairy
to
reg'lations'
as
he
spoke
he
looked
over
the
wall
but
the
cat
on
seeing
him
retreated
with
a
growl
into
a
bed
of
tall
flowers
and
was
hidden
he
went
on
'blest
if
that
ar
critter
ain't
got
more
sense
of
what's
good
for
her
than
most
christians
i
guess
we've
seen
the
last
of
her
you
bet
she'll
go
back
now
to
that
busted
kitten
and
have
a
private
funeral
of
it
all
to
herself'
amelia
did
not
like
to
say
more
lest
he
might
in
mistaken
kindness
to
her
fulfil
his
threat
of
shooting
the
cat
and
so
we
went
on
and
crossed
the
little
wooden
bridge
leading
to
the
gateway
whence
ran
the
steep
paved
roadway
between
the
burg
and
the
pentagonal
torture
tower
as
we
crossed
the
bridge
we
saw
the
cat
again
down
below
us
when
she
saw
us
her
fury
seemed
to
return
and
she
made
frantic
efforts
to
get
up
the
steep
wall
hutcheson
laughed
as
he
looked
down
at
her
and
said
'goodbye
old
girl
sorry
i
injured
your
feelin's
but
you'll
get
over
it
in
time
so
long'
and
then
we
passed
through
the
long
dim
archway
and
came
to
the
gate
of
the
burg
when
we
came
out
again
after
our
survey
of
this
most
beautiful
old
place
which
not
even
the
well-intentioned
efforts
of
the
gothic
restorers
of
forty
years
ago
have
been
able
to
spoil--though
their
restoration
was
then
glaring
white--we
seemed
to
have
quite
forgotten
the
unpleasant
episode
of
the
morning
the
old
lime
tree
with
its
great
trunk
gnarled
with
the
passing
of
nearly
nine
centuries
the
deep
well
cut
through
the
heart
of
the
rock
by
those
captives
of
old
and
the
lovely
view
from
the
city
wall
whence
we
heard
spread
over
almost
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
the
multitudinous
chimes
of
the
city
had
all
helped
to
wipe
out
from
our
minds
the
incident
of
the
slain
kitten
we
were
the
only
visitors
who
had
entered
the
torture
tower
that
morning--so
at
least
said
the
old
custodian--and
as
we
had
the
place
all
to
ourselves
were
able
to
make
a
minute
and
more
satisfactory
survey
than
would
have
otherwise
been
possible
the
custodian
looking
to
us
as
the
sole
source
of
his
gains
for
the
day
was
willing
to
meet
our
wishes
in
any
way
the
torture
tower
is
truly
a
grim
place
even
now
when
many
thousands
of
visitors
have
sent
a
stream
of
life
and
the
joy
that
follows
life
into
the
place
but
at
the
time
i
mention
it
wore
its
grimmest
and
most
gruesome
aspect
the
dust
of
ages
seemed
to
have
settled
on
it
and
the
darkness
and
the
horror
of
its
memories
seem
to
have
become
sentient
in
a
way
that
would
have
satisfied
the
pantheistic
souls
of
philo
or
spinoza
the
lower
chamber
where
we
entered
was
seemingly
in
its
normal
state
filled
with
incarnate
darkness
even
the
hot
sunlight
streaming
in
through
the
door
seemed
to
be
lost
in
the
vast
thickness
of
the
walls
and
only
showed
the
masonry
rough
as
when
the
builder's
scaffolding
had
come
down
but
coated
with
dust
and
marked
here
and
there
with
patches
of
dark
stain
which
if
walls
could
speak
could
have
given
their
own
dread
memories
of
fear
and
pain
we
were
glad
to
pass
up
the
dusty
wooden
staircase
the
custodian
leaving
the
outer
door
open
to
light
us
somewhat
on
our
way
for
to
our
eyes
the
one
long-wick'd
evil-smelling
candle
stuck
in
a
sconce
on
the
wall
gave
an
inadequate
light
when
we
came
up
through
the
open
trap
in
the
corner
of
the
chamber
overhead
amelia
held
on
to
me
so
tightly
that
i
could
actually
feel
her
heart
beat
i
must
say
for
my
own
part
that
i
was
not
surprised
at
her
fear
for
this
room
was
even
more
gruesome
than
that
below
here
there
was
certainly
more
light
but
only
just
sufficient
to
realise
the
horrible
surroundings
of
the
place
the
builders
of
the
tower
had
evidently
intended
that
only
they
who
should
gain
the
top
should
have
any
of
the
joys
of
light
and
prospect
there
as
we
had
noticed
from
below
were
ranges
of
windows
albeit
of
mediaeval
smallness
but
elsewhere
in
the
tower
were
only
a
very
few
narrow
slits
such
as
were
habitual
in
places
of
mediaeval
defence
a
few
of
these
only
lit
the
chamber
and
these
so
high
up
in
the
wall
that
from
no
part
could
the
sky
be
seen
through
the
thickness
of
the
walls
in
racks
and
leaning
in
disorder
against
the
walls
were
a
number
of
headsmen's
swords
great
double-handed
weapons
with
broad
blade
and
keen
edge
hard
by
were
several
blocks
whereon
the
necks
of
the
victims
had
lain
with
here
and
there
deep
notches
where
the
steel
had
bitten
through
the
guard
of
flesh
and
shored
into
the
wood
round
the
chamber
placed
in
all
sorts
of
irregular
ways
were
many
implements
of
torture
which
made
one's
heart
ache
to
see--chairs
full
of
spikes
which
gave
instant
and
excruciating
pain
chairs
and
couches
with
dull
knobs
whose
torture
was
seemingly
less
but
which
though
slower
were
equally
efficacious
racks
belts
boots
gloves
collars
all
made
for
compressing
at
will
steel
baskets
in
which
the
head
could
be
slowly
crushed
into
a
pulp
if
necessary
watchmen's
hooks
with
long
handle
and
knife
that
cut
at
resistance--this
a
speciality
of
the
old
nurnberg
police
system
and
many
many
other
devices
for
man's
injury
to
man
amelia
grew
quite
pale
with
the
horror
of
the
things
but
fortunately
did
not
faint
for
being
a
little
overcome
she
sat
down
on
a
torture
chair
but
jumped
up
again
with
a
shriek
all
tendency
to
faint
gone
we
both
pretended
that
it
was
the
injury
done
to
her
dress
by
the
dust
of
the
chair
and
the
rusty
spikes
which
had
upset
her
and
mr
hutcheson
acquiesced
in
accepting
the
explanation
with
a
kind-hearted
laugh
but
the
central
object
in
the
whole
of
this
chamber
of
horrors
was
the
engine
known
as
the
iron
virgin
which
stood
near
the
centre
of
the
room
it
was
a
rudely-shaped
figure
of
a
woman
something
of
the
bell
order
or
to
make
a
closer
comparison
of
the
figure
of
mrs
noah
in
the
children's
ark
but
without
that
slimness
of
waist
and
perfect
rondeur
of
hip
which
marks
the
aesthetic
type
of
the
noah
family
one
would
hardly
have
recognised
it
as
intended
for
a
human
figure
at
all
had
not
the
founder
shaped
on
the
forehead
a
rude
semblance
of
a
woman's
face
this
machine
was
coated
with
rust
without
and
covered
with
dust
a
rope
was
fastened
to
a
ring
in
the
front
of
the
figure
about
where
the
waist
should
have
been
and
was
drawn
through
a
pulley
fastened
on
the
wooden
pillar
which
sustained
the
flooring
above
the
custodian
pulling
this
rope
showed
that
a
section
of
the
front
was
hinged
like
a
door
at
one
side
we
then
saw
that
the
engine
was
of
considerable
thickness
leaving
just
room
enough
inside
for
a
man
to
be
placed
the
door
was
of
equal
thickness
and
of
great
weight
for
it
took
the
custodian
all
his
strength
aided
though
he
was
by
the
contrivance
of
the
pulley
to
open
it
this
weight
was
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
the
door
was
of
manifest
purpose
hung
so
as
to
throw
its
weight
downwards
so
that
it
might
shut
of
its
own
accord
when
the
strain
was
released
the
inside
was
honeycombed
with
rust--nay
more
the
rust
alone
that
comes
through
time
would
hardly
have
eaten
so
deep
into
the
iron
walls
the
rust
of
the
cruel
stains
was
deep
indeed
it
was
only
however
when
we
came
to
look
at
the
inside
of
the
door
that
the
diabolical
intention
was
manifest
to
the
full
here
were
several
long
spikes
square
and
massive
broad
at
the
base
and
sharp
at
the
points
placed
in
such
a
position
that
when
the
door
should
close
the
upper
ones
would
pierce
the
eyes
of
the
victim
and
the
lower
ones
his
heart
and
vitals
the
sight
was
too
much
for
poor
amelia
and
this
time
she
fainted
dead
off
and
i
had
to
carry
her
down
the
stairs
and
place
her
on
a
bench
outside
till
she
recovered
that
she
felt
it
to
the
quick
was
afterwards
shown
by
the
fact
that
my
eldest
son
bears
to
this
day
a
rude
birthmark
on
his
breast
which
has
by
family
consent
been
accepted
as
representing
the
nurnberg
virgin
when
we
got
back
to
the
chamber
we
found
hutcheson
still
opposite
the
iron
virgin
he
had
been
evidently
philosophising
and
now
gave
us
the
benefit
of
his
thought
in
the
shape
of
a
sort
of
exordium
'wall
i
guess
i've
been
learnin'
somethin'
here
while
madam
has
been
gettin'
over
her
faint
'pears
to
me
that
we're
a
long
way
behind
the
times
on
our
side
of
the
big
drink
we
uster
think
out
on
the
plains
that
the
injun
could
give
us
points
in
tryin'
to
make
a
man
uncomfortable
but
i
guess
your
old
mediaeval
law-and-order
party
could
raise
him
every
time
splinters
was
pretty
good
in
his
bluff
on
the
squaw
but
this
here
young
miss
held
a
straight
flush
all
high
on
him
the
points
of
them
spikes
air
sharp
enough
still
though
even
the
edges
air
eaten
out
by
what
uster
be
on
them
it'd
be
a
good
thing
for
our
indian
section
to
get
some
specimens
of
this
here
play-toy
to
send
round
to
the
reservations
jest
to
knock
the
stuffin'
out
of
the
bucks
and
the
squaws
too
by
showing
them
as
how
old
civilisation
lays
over
them
at
their
best
guess
but
i'll
get
in
that
box
a
minute
jest
to
see
how
it
feels'
'oh
no
no'
said
amelia
'it
is
too
terrible'
'guess
ma'am
nothin's
too
terrible
to
the
explorin'
mind
i've
been
in
some
queer
places
in
my
time
spent
a
night
inside
a
dead
horse
while
a
prairie
fire
swept
over
me
in
montana
territory--an'
another
time
slept
inside
a
dead
buffler
when
the
comanches
was
on
the
war
path
an'
i
didn't
keer
to
leave
my
kyard
on
them
i've
been
two
days
in
a
caved-in
tunnel
in
the
billy
broncho
gold
mine
in
new
mexico
an'
was
one
of
the
four
shut
up
for
three
parts
of
a
day
in
the
caisson
what
slid
over
on
her
side
when
we
was
settin'
the
foundations
of
the
buffalo
bridge
i've
not
funked
an
odd
experience
yet
an'
i
don't
propose
to
begin
now'
we
saw
that
he
was
set
on
the
experiment
so
i
said
'well
hurry
up
old
man
and
get
through
it
quick'
'all
right
general'
said
he
'but
i
calculate
we
ain't
quite
ready
yet
the
gentlemen
my
predecessors
what
stood
in
that
thar
canister
didn't
volunteer
for
the
office--not
much
and
i
guess
there
was
some
ornamental
tyin'
up
before
the
big
stroke
was
made
i
want
to
go
into
this
thing
fair
and
square
so
i
must
get
fixed
up
proper
first
i
dare
say
this
old
galoot
can
rise
some
string
and
tie
me
up
accordin'
to
sample'
this
was
said
interrogatively
to
the
old
custodian
but
the
latter
who
understood
the
drift
of
his
speech
though
perhaps
not
appreciating
to
the
full
the
niceties
of
dialect
and
imagery
shook
his
head
his
protest
was
however
only
formal
and
made
to
be
overcome
the
american
thrust
a
gold
piece
into
his
hand
saying
'take
it
pard
it's
your
pot
and
don't
be
skeer'd
this
ain't
no
necktie
party
that
you're
asked
to
assist
in'
he
produced
some
thin
frayed
rope
and
proceeded
to
bind
our
companion
with
sufficient
strictness
for
the
purpose
when
the
upper
part
of
his
body
was
bound
hutcheson
said
'hold
on
a
moment
judge
guess
i'm
too
heavy
for
you
to
tote
into
the
canister
you
jest
let
me
walk
in
and
then
you
can
wash
up
regardin'
my
legs'
whilst
speaking
he
had
backed
himself
into
the
opening
which
was
just
enough
to
hold
him
it
was
a
close
fit
and
no
mistake
amelia
looked
on
with
fear
in
her
eyes
but
she
evidently
did
not
like
to
say
anything
then
the
custodian
completed
his
task
by
tying
the
american's
feet
together
so
that
he
was
now
absolutely
helpless
and
fixed
in
his
voluntary
prison
he
seemed
to
really
enjoy
it
and
the
incipient
smile
which
was
habitual
to
his
face
blossomed
into
actuality
as
he
said
'guess
this
here
eve
was
made
out
of
the
rib
of
a
dwarf
there
ain't
much
room
for
a
full-grown
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
hustle
we
uster
make
our
coffins
more
roomier
in
idaho
territory
now
judge
you
jest
begin
to
let
this
door
down
slow
on
to
me
i
want
to
feel
the
same
pleasure
as
the
other
jays
had
when
those
spikes
began
to
move
toward
their
eyes'
'oh
no
no
no'
broke
in
amelia
hysterically
'it
is
too
terrible
i
can't
bear
to
see
it--i
can't
i
can't'
but
the
american
was
obdurate
'say
colonel'
said
he
'why
not
take
madame
for
a
little
promenade
i
wouldn't
hurt
her
feelin's
for
the
world
but
now
that
i
am
here
havin'
kem
eight
thousand
miles
wouldn't
it
be
too
hard
to
give
up
the
very
experience
i've
been
pinin'
an'
pantin'
fur
a
man
can't
get
to
feel
like
canned
goods
every
time
me
and
the
judge
here'll
fix
up
this
thing
in
no
time
an'
then
you'll
come
back
an'
we'll
all
laugh
together'
once
more
the
resolution
that
is
born
of
curiosity
triumphed
and
amelia
stayed
holding
tight
to
my
arm
and
shivering
whilst
the
custodian
began
to
slacken
slowly
inch
by
inch
the
rope
that
held
back
the
iron
door
hutcheson's
face
was
positively
radiant
as
his
eyes
followed
the
first
movement
of
the
spikes
'wall'
he
said
'i
guess
i've
not
had
enjoyment
like
this
since
i
left
noo
york
bar
a
scrap
with
a
french
sailor
at
wapping--an'
that
warn't
much
of
a
picnic
neither--i've
not
had
a
show
fur
real
pleasure
in
this
dod-rotted
continent
where
there
ain't
no
b'ars
nor
no
injuns
an'
wheer
nary
man
goes
heeled
slow
there
judge
don't
you
rush
this
business
i
want
a
show
for
my
money
this
game--i
du'
the
custodian
must
have
had
in
him
some
of
the
blood
of
his
predecessors
in
that
ghastly
tower
for
he
worked
the
engine
with
a
deliberate
and
excruciating
slowness
which
after
five
minutes
in
which
the
outer
edge
of
the
door
had
not
moved
half
as
many
inches
began
to
overcome
amelia
i
saw
her
lips
whiten
and
felt
her
hold
upon
my
arm
relax
i
looked
around
an
instant
for
a
place
whereon
to
lay
her
and
when
i
looked
at
her
again
found
that
her
eye
had
become
fixed
on
the
side
of
the
virgin
following
its
direction
i
saw
the
black
cat
crouching
out
of
sight
her
green
eyes
shone
like
danger
lamps
in
the
gloom
of
the
place
and
their
colour
was
heightened
by
the
blood
which
still
smeared
her
coat
and
reddened
her
mouth
i
cried
out
'the
cat
look
out
for
the
cat'
for
even
then
she
sprang
out
before
the
engine
at
this
moment
she
looked
like
a
triumphant
demon
her
eyes
blazed
with
ferocity
her
hair
bristled
out
till
she
seemed
twice
her
normal
size
and
her
tail
lashed
about
as
does
a
tiger's
when
the
quarry
is
before
it
elias
p
hutcheson
when
he
saw
her
was
amused
and
his
eyes
positively
sparkled
with
fun
as
he
said
'darned
if
the
squaw
hain't
got
on
all
her
war
paint
jest
give
her
a
shove
off
if
she
comes
any
of
her
tricks
on
me
for
i'm
so
fixed
everlastingly
by
the
boss
that
durn
my
skin
if
i
can
keep
my
eyes
from
her
if
she
wants
them
easy
there
judge
don't
you
slack
that
ar
rope
or
i'm
euchered'
at
this
moment
amelia
completed
her
faint
and
i
had
to
clutch
hold
of
her
round
the
waist
or
she
would
have
fallen
to
the
floor
whilst
attending
to
her
i
saw
the
black
cat
crouching
for
a
spring
and
jumped
up
to
turn
the
creature
out
but
at
that
instant
with
a
sort
of
hellish
scream
she
hurled
herself
not
as
we
expected
at
hutcheson
but
straight
at
the
face
of
the
custodian
her
claws
seemed
to
be
tearing
wildly
as
one
sees
in
the
chinese
drawings
of
the
dragon
rampant
and
as
i
looked
i
saw
one
of
them
light
on
the
poor
man's
eye
and
actually
tear
through
it
and
down
his
cheek
leaving
a
wide
band
of
red
where
the
blood
seemed
to
spurt
from
every
vein
with
a
yell
of
sheer
terror
which
came
quicker
than
even
his
sense
of
pain
the
man
leaped
back
dropping
as
he
did
so
the
rope
which
held
back
the
iron
door
i
jumped
for
it
but
was
too
late
for
the
cord
ran
like
lightning
through
the
pulley-block
and
the
heavy
mass
fell
forward
from
its
own
weight
as
the
door
closed
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
our
poor
companion's
face
he
seemed
frozen
with
terror
his
eyes
stared
with
a
horrible
anguish
as
if
dazed
and
no
sound
came
from
his
lips
and
then
the
spikes
did
their
work
happily
the
end
was
quick
for
when
i
wrenched
open
the
door
they
had
pierced
so
deep
that
they
had
locked
in
the
bones
of
the
skull
through
which
they
had
crushed
and
actually
tore
him--it--out
of
his
iron
prison
till
bound
as
he
was
he
fell
at
full
length
with
a
sickly
thud
upon
the
floor
the
face
turning
upward
as
he
fell
i
rushed
to
my
wife
lifted
her
up
and
carried
her
out
for
i
feared
for
her
very
reason
if
she
should
wake
from
her
faint
to
such
a
scene
i
laid
her
on
the
bench
outside
and
ran
back
leaning
against
the
wooden
column
was
the
custodian
moaning
in
pain
whilst
he
held
his
reddening
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
and
sitting
on
the
head
of
the
poor
american
was
the
cat
purring
loudly
as
she
licked
the
blood
which
trickled
through
the
gashed
socket
of
his
eyes
i
think
no
one
will
call
me
cruel
because
i
seized
one
of
the
old
executioner's
swords
and
shore
her
in
two
as
she
sat
the
secret
of
the
growing
gold
when
margaret
delandre
went
to
live
at
brent's
rock
the
whole
neighbourhood
awoke
to
the
pleasure
of
an
entirely
new
scandal
scandals
in
connection
with
either
the
delandre
family
or
the
brents
of
brent's
rock
were
not
few
and
if
the
secret
history
of
the
county
had
been
written
in
full
both
names
would
have
been
found
well
represented
it
is
true
that
the
status
of
each
was
so
different
that
they
might
have
belonged
to
different
continents--or
to
different
worlds
for
the
matter
of
that--for
hitherto
their
orbits
had
never
crossed
the
brents
were
accorded
by
the
whole
section
of
the
country
a
unique
social
dominance
and
had
ever
held
themselves
as
high
above
the
yeoman
class
to
which
margaret
delandre
belonged
as
a
blue-blooded
spanish
hidalgo
out-tops
his
peasant
tenantry
the
delandres
had
an
ancient
record
and
were
proud
of
it
in
their
way
as
the
brents
were
of
theirs
but
the
family
had
never
risen
above
yeomanry
and
although
they
had
been
once
well-to-do
in
the
good
old
times
of
foreign
wars
and
protection
their
fortunes
had
withered
under
the
scorching
of
the
free
trade
sun
and
the
'piping
times
of
peace'
they
had
as
the
elder
members
used
to
assert
'stuck
to
the
land'
with
the
result
that
they
had
taken
root
in
it
body
and
soul
in
fact
they
having
chosen
the
life
of
vegetables
had
flourished
as
vegetation
does--blossomed
and
thrived
in
the
good
season
and
suffered
in
the
bad
their
holding
dander's
croft
seemed
to
have
been
worked
out
and
to
be
typical
of
the
family
which
had
inhabited
it
the
latter
had
declined
generation
after
generation
sending
out
now
and
again
some
abortive
shoot
of
unsatisfied
energy
in
the
shape
of
a
soldier
or
sailor
who
had
worked
his
way
to
the
minor
grades
of
the
services
and
had
there
stopped
cut
short
either
from
unheeding
gallantry
in
action
or
from
that
destroying
cause
to
men
without
breeding
or
youthful
care--the
recognition
of
a
position
above
them
which
they
feel
unfitted
to
fill
so
little
by
little
the
family
dropped
lower
and
lower
the
men
brooding
and
dissatisfied
and
drinking
themselves
into
the
grave
the
women
drudging
at
home
or
marrying
beneath
them--or
worse
in
process
of
time
all
disappeared
leaving
only
two
in
the
croft
wykham
delandre
and
his
sister
margaret
the
man
and
woman
seemed
to
have
inherited
in
masculine
and
feminine
form
respectively
the
evil
tendency
of
their
race
sharing
in
common
the
principles
though
manifesting
them
in
different
ways
of
sullen
passion
voluptuousness
and
recklessness
the
history
of
the
brents
had
been
something
similar
but
showing
the
causes
of
decadence
in
their
aristocratic
and
not
their
plebeian
forms
they
too
had
sent
their
shoots
to
the
wars
but
their
positions
had
been
different
and
they
had
often
attained
honour--for
without
flaw
they
were
gallant
and
brave
deeds
were
done
by
them
before
the
selfish
dissipation
which
marked
them
had
sapped
their
vigour
the
present
head
of
the
family--if
family
it
could
now
be
called
when
one
remained
of
the
direct
line--was
geoffrey
brent
he
was
almost
a
type
of
worn
out
race
manifesting
in
some
ways
its
most
brilliant
qualities
and
in
others
its
utter
degradation
he
might
be
fairly
compared
with
some
of
those
antique
italian
nobles
whom
the
painters
have
preserved
to
us
with
their
courage
their
unscrupulousness
their
refinement
of
lust
and
cruelty--the
voluptuary
actual
with
the
fiend
potential
he
was
certainly
handsome
with
that
dark
aquiline
commanding
beauty
which
women
so
generally
recognise
as
dominant
with
men
he
was
distant
and
cold
but
such
a
bearing
never
deters
womankind
the
inscrutable
laws
of
sex
have
so
arranged
that
even
a
timid
woman
is
not
afraid
of
a
fierce
and
haughty
man
and
so
it
was
that
there
was
hardly
a
woman
of
any
kind
or
degree
who
lived
within
view
of
brent's
rock
who
did
not
cherish
some
form
of
secret
admiration
for
the
handsome
wastrel
the
category
was
a
wide
one
for
brent's
rock
rose
up
steeply
from
the
midst
of
a
level
region
and
for
a
circuit
of
a
hundred
miles
it
lay
on
the
horizon
with
its
high
old
towers
and
steep
roofs
cutting
the
level
edge
of
wood
and
hamlet
and
far-scattered
mansions
so
long
as
geoffrey
brent
confined
his
dissipations
to
london
and
paris
and
vienna--anywhere
out
of
sight
and
sound
of
his
home--opinion
was
silent
it
is
easy
to
listen
to
far
off
echoes
unmoved
and
we
can
treat
them
with
disbelief
or
scorn
or
disdain
or
whatever
attitude
of
coldness
may
suit
our
purpose
but
when
the
scandal
came
close
home
it
was
another
matter
and
the
feelings
of
independence
and
integrity
which
is
in
people
of
every
community
which
is
not
utterly
spoiled
asserted
itself
and
demanded
that
condemnation
should
be
expressed
still
there
was
a
certain
reticence
in
all
and
no
more
notice
was
taken
of
the
existing
facts
than
was
absolutely
necessary
margaret
delandre
bore
herself
so
fearlessly
and
so
openly--she
accepted
her
position
as
the
justified
companion
of
geoffrey
brent
so
naturally
that
people
came
to
believe
that
she
was
secretly
married
to
him
and
therefore
thought
it
wiser
to
hold
their
tongues
lest
time
should
justify
her
and
also
make
her
an
active
enemy
the
one
person
who
by
his
interference
could
have
settled
all
doubts
was
debarred
by
circumstances
from
interfering
in
the
matter
wykham
delandre
had
quarrelled
with
his
sister--or
perhaps
it
was
that
she
had
quarrelled
with
him--and
they
were
on
terms
not
merely
of
armed
neutrality
but
of
bitter
hatred
the
quarrel
had
been
antecedent
to
margaret
going
to
brent's
rock
she
and
wykham
had
almost
come
to
blows
there
had
certainly
been
threats
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
and
in
the
end
wykham
overcome
with
passion
had
ordered
his
sister
to
leave
his
house
she
had
risen
straightway
and
without
waiting
to
pack
up
even
her
own
personal
belongings
had
walked
out
of
the
house
on
the
threshold
she
had
paused
for
a
moment
to
hurl
a
bitter
threat
at
wykham
that
he
would
rue
in
shame
and
despair
to
the
last
hour
of
his
life
his
act
of
that
day
some
weeks
had
since
passed
and
it
was
understood
in
the
neighbourhood
that
margaret
had
gone
to
london
when
she
suddenly
appeared
driving
out
with
geoffrey
brent
and
the
entire
neighbourhood
knew
before
nightfall
that
she
had
taken
up
her
abode
at
the
rock
it
was
no
subject
of
surprise
that
brent
had
come
back
unexpectedly
for
such
was
his
usual
custom
even
his
own
servants
never
knew
when
to
expect
him
for
there
was
a
private
door
of
which
he
alone
had
the
key
by
which
he
sometimes
entered
without
anyone
in
the
house
being
aware
of
his
coming
this
was
his
usual
method
of
appearing
after
a
long
absence
wykham
delandre
was
furious
at
the
news
he
vowed
vengeance--and
to
keep
his
mind
level
with
his
passion
drank
deeper
than
ever
he
tried
several
times
to
see
his
sister
but
she
contemptuously
refused
to
meet
him
he
tried
to
have
an
interview
with
brent
and
was
refused
by
him
also
then
he
tried
to
stop
him
in
the
road
but
without
avail
for
geoffrey
was
not
a
man
to
be
stopped
against
his
will
several
actual
encounters
took
place
between
the
two
men
and
many
more
were
threatened
and
avoided
at
last
wykham
delandre
settled
down
to
a
morose
vengeful
acceptance
of
the
situation
neither
margaret
nor
geoffrey
was
of
a
pacific
temperament
and
it
was
not
long
before
there
began
to
be
quarrels
between
them
one
thing
would
lead
to
another
and
wine
flowed
freely
at
brent's
rock
now
and
again
the
quarrels
would
assume
a
bitter
aspect
and
threats
would
be
exchanged
in
uncompromising
language
that
fairly
awed
the
listening
servants
but
such
quarrels
generally
ended
where
domestic
altercations
do
in
reconciliation
and
in
a
mutual
respect
for
the
fighting
qualities
proportionate
to
their
manifestation
fighting
for
its
own
sake
is
found
by
a
certain
class
of
persons
all
the
world
over
to
be
a
matter
of
absorbing
interest
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
domestic
conditions
minimise
its
potency
geoffrey
and
margaret
made
occasional
absences
from
brent's
rock
and
on
each
of
these
occasions
wykham
delandre
also
absented
himself
but
as
he
generally
heard
of
the
absence
too
late
to
be
of
any
service
he
returned
home
each
time
in
a
more
bitter
and
discontented
frame
of
mind
than
before
at
last
there
came
a
time
when
the
absence
from
brent's
rock
became
longer
than
before
only
a
few
days
earlier
there
had
been
a
quarrel
exceeding
in
bitterness
anything
which
had
gone
before
but
this
too
had
been
made
up
and
a
trip
on
the
continent
had
been
mentioned
before
the
servants
after
a
few
days
wykham
delandre
also
went
away
and
it
was
some
weeks
before
he
returned
it
was
noticed
that
he
was
full
of
some
new
importance--satisfaction
exaltation--they
hardly
knew
how
to
call
it
he
went
straightway
to
brent's
rock
and
demanded
to
see
geoffrey
brent
and
on
being
told
that
he
had
not
yet
returned
said
with
a
grim
decision
which
the
servants
noted
'i
shall
come
again
my
news
is
solid--it
can
wait'
and
turned
away
week
after
week
went
by
and
month
after
month
and
then
there
came
a
rumour
certified
later
on
that
an
accident
had
occurred
in
the
zermatt
valley
whilst
crossing
a
dangerous
pass
the
carriage
containing
an
english
lady
and
the
driver
had
fallen
over
a
precipice
the
gentleman
of
the
party
mr
geoffrey
brent
having
been
fortunately
saved
as
he
had
been
walking
up
the
hill
to
ease
the
horses
he
gave
information
and
search
was
made
the
broken
rail
the
excoriated
roadway
the
marks
where
the
horses
had
struggled
on
the
decline
before
finally
pitching
over
into
the
torrent--all
told
the
sad
tale
it
was
a
wet
season
and
there
had
been
much
snow
in
the
winter
so
that
the
river
was
swollen
beyond
its
usual
volume
and
the
eddies
of
the
stream
were
packed
with
ice
all
search
was
made
and
finally
the
wreck
of
the
carriage
and
the
body
of
one
horse
were
found
in
an
eddy
of
the
river
later
on
the
body
of
the
driver
was
found
on
the
sandy
torrent-swept
waste
near
tã¤sch
but
the
body
of
the
lady
like
that
of
the
other
horse
had
quite
disappeared
and
was--what
was
left
of
it
by
that
time--whirling
amongst
the
eddies
of
the
rhone
on
its
way
down
to
the
lake
of
geneva
wykham
delandre
made
all
the
enquiries
possible
but
could
not
find
any
trace
of
the
missing
woman
he
found
however
in
the
books
of
the
various
hotels
the
name
of
'mr
and
mrs
geoffrey
brent'
and
he
had
a
stone
erected
at
zermatt
to
his
sister's
memory
under
her
married
name
and
a
tablet
put
up
in
the
church
at
bretten
the
parish
in
which
both
brent's
rock
and
dander's
croft
were
situated
there
was
a
lapse
of
nearly
a
year
after
the
excitement
of
the
matter
had
worn
away
and
the
whole
neighbourhood
had
gone
on
its
accustomed
way
brent
was
still
absent
and
delandre
more
drunken
more
morose
and
more
revengeful
than
before
then
there
was
a
new
excitement
brent's
rock
was
being
made
ready
for
a
new
mistress
it
was
officially
announced
by
geoffrey
himself
in
a
letter
to
the
vicar
that
he
had
been
married
some
months
before
to
an
italian
lady
and
that
they
were
then
on
their
way
home
then
a
small
army
of
workmen
invaded
the
house
and
hammer
and
plane
sounded
and
a
general
air
of
size
and
paint
pervaded
the
atmosphere
one
wing
of
the
old
house
the
south
was
entirely
re-done
and
then
the
great
body
of
the
workmen
departed
leaving
only
materials
for
the
doing
of
the
old
hall
when
geoffrey
brent
should
have
returned
for
he
had
directed
that
the
decoration
was
only
to
be
done
under
his
own
eyes
he
had
brought
with
him
accurate
drawings
of
a
hall
in
the
house
of
his
bride's
father
for
he
wished
to
reproduce
for
her
the
place
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
as
the
moulding
had
all
to
be
re-done
some
scaffolding
poles
and
boards
were
brought
in
and
laid
on
one
side
of
the
great
hall
and
also
a
great
wooden
tank
or
box
for
mixing
the
lime
which
was
laid
in
bags
beside
it
when
the
new
mistress
of
brent's
rock
arrived
the
bells
of
the
church
rang
out
and
there
was
a
general
jubilation
she
was
a
beautiful
creature
full
of
the
poetry
and
fire
and
passion
of
the
south
and
the
few
english
words
which
she
had
learned
were
spoken
in
such
a
sweet
and
pretty
broken
way
that
she
won
the
hearts
of
the
people
almost
as
much
by
the
music
of
her
voice
as
by
the
melting
beauty
of
her
dark
eyes
geoffrey
brent
seemed
more
happy
than
he
had
ever
before
appeared
but
there
was
a
dark
anxious
look
on
his
face
that
was
new
to
those
who
knew
him
of
old
and
he
started
at
times
as
though
at
some
noise
that
was
unheard
by
others
and
so
months
passed
and
the
whisper
grew
that
at
last
brent's
rock
was
to
have
an
heir
geoffrey
was
very
tender
to
his
wife
and
the
new
bond
between
them
seemed
to
soften
him
he
took
more
interest
in
his
tenants
and
their
needs
than
he
had
ever
done
and
works
of
charity
on
his
part
as
well
as
on
his
sweet
young
wife's
were
not
lacking
he
seemed
to
have
set
all
his
hopes
on
the
child
that
was
coming
and
as
he
looked
deeper
into
the
future
the
dark
shadow
that
had
come
over
his
face
seemed
to
die
gradually
away
all
the
time
wykham
delandre
nursed
his
revenge
deep
in
his
heart
had
grown
up
a
purpose
of
vengeance
which
only
waited
an
opportunity
to
crystallise
and
take
a
definite
shape
his
vague
idea
was
somehow
centred
in
the
wife
of
brent
for
he
knew
that
he
could
strike
him
best
through
those
he
loved
and
the
coming
time
seemed
to
hold
in
its
womb
the
opportunity
for
which
he
longed
one
night
he
sat
alone
in
the
living-room
of
his
house
it
had
once
been
a
handsome
room
in
its
way
but
time
and
neglect
had
done
their
work
and
it
was
now
little
better
than
a
ruin
without
dignity
or
picturesqueness
of
any
kind
he
had
been
drinking
heavily
for
some
time
and
was
more
than
half
stupefied
he
thought
he
heard
a
noise
as
of
someone
at
the
door
and
looked
up
then
he
called
half
savagely
to
come
in
but
there
was
no
response
with
a
muttered
blasphemy
he
renewed
his
potations
presently
he
forgot
all
around
him
sank
into
a
daze
but
suddenly
awoke
to
see
standing
before
him
someone
or
something
like
a
battered
ghostly
edition
of
his
sister
for
a
few
moments
there
came
upon
him
a
sort
of
fear
the
woman
before
him
with
distorted
features
and
burning
eyes
seemed
hardly
human
and
the
only
thing
that
seemed
a
reality
of
his
sister
as
she
had
been
was
her
wealth
of
golden
hair
and
this
was
now
streaked
with
grey
she
eyed
her
brother
with
a
long
cold
stare
and
he
too
as
he
looked
and
began
to
realise
the
actuality
of
her
presence
found
the
hatred
of
her
which
he
had
had
once
again
surging
up
in
his
heart
all
the
brooding
passion
of
the
past
year
seemed
to
find
a
voice
at
once
as
he
asked
her
'why
are
you
here
you're
dead
and
buried'
'i
am
here
wykham
delandre
for
no
love
of
you
but
because
i
hate
another
even
more
than
i
do
you'
a
great
passion
blazed
in
her
eyes
'him'
he
asked
in
so
fierce
a
whisper
that
even
the
woman
was
for
an
instant
startled
till
she
regained
her
calm
'yes
him'
she
answered
'but
make
no
mistake
my
revenge
is
my
own
and
i
merely
use
you
to
help
me
to
it'
wykham
asked
suddenly
'did
he
marry
you'
the
woman's
distorted
face
broadened
out
in
a
ghastly
attempt
at
a
smile
it
was
a
hideous
mockery
for
the
broken
features
and
seamed
scars
took
strange
shapes
and
strange
colours
and
queer
lines
of
white
showed
out
as
the
straining
muscles
pressed
on
the
old
cicatrices
'so
you
would
like
to
know
it
would
please
your
pride
to
feel
that
your
sister
was
truly
married
well
you
shall
not
know
that
was
my
revenge
on
you
and
i
do
not
mean
to
change
it
by
a
hair's
breadth
i
have
come
here
tonight
simply
to
let
you
know
that
i
am
alive
so
that
if
any
violence
be
done
me
where
i
am
going
there
may
be
a
witness'
'where
are
you
going'
demanded
her
brother
'that
is
my
affair
and
i
have
not
the
least
intention
of
letting
you
know'
wykham
stood
up
but
the
drink
was
on
him
and
he
reeled
and
fell
as
he
lay
on
the
floor
he
announced
his
intention
of
following
his
sister
and
with
an
outburst
of
splenetic
humour
told
her
that
he
would
follow
her
through
the
darkness
by
the
light
of
her
hair
and
of
her
beauty
at
this
she
turned
on
him
and
said
that
there
were
others
beside
him
that
would
rue
her
hair
and
her
beauty
too
'as
he
will'
she
hissed
'for
the
hair
remains
though
the
beauty
be
gone
when
he
withdrew
the
lynch-pin
and
sent
us
over
the
precipice
into
the
torrent
he
had
little
thought
of
my
beauty
perhaps
his
beauty
would
be
scarred
like
mine
were
he
whirled
as
i
was
among
the
rocks
of
the
visp
and
frozen
on
the
ice
pack
in
the
drift
of
the
river
but
let
him
beware
his
time
is
coming'
and
with
a
fierce
gesture
she
flung
open
the
door
and
passed
out
into
the
night





later
on
that
night
mrs
brent
who
was
but
half-asleep
became
suddenly
awake
and
spoke
to
her
husband
'geoffrey
was
not
that
the
click
of
a
lock
somewhere
below
our
window'
but
geoffrey--though
she
thought
that
he
too
had
started
at
the
noise--seemed
sound
asleep
and
breathed
heavily
again
mrs
brent
dozed
but
this
time
awoke
to
the
fact
that
her
husband
had
arisen
and
was
partially
dressed
he
was
deadly
pale
and
when
the
light
of
the
lamp
which
he
had
in
his
hand
fell
on
his
face
she
was
frightened
at
the
look
in
his
eyes
'what
is
it
geoffrey
what
dost
thou'
she
asked
'hush
little
one'
he
answered
in
a
strange
hoarse
voice
'go
to
sleep
i
am
restless
and
wish
to
finish
some
work
i
left
undone'
'bring
it
here
my
husband'
she
said
'i
am
lonely
and
i
fear
when
thou
art
away'
for
reply
he
merely
kissed
her
and
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
she
lay
awake
for
awhile
and
then
nature
asserted
itself
and
she
slept
suddenly
she
started
broad
awake
with
the
memory
in
her
ears
of
a
smothered
cry
from
somewhere
not
far
off
she
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
door
and
listened
but
there
was
no
sound
she
grew
alarmed
for
her
husband
and
called
out
'geoffrey
geoffrey'
after
a
few
moments
the
door
of
the
great
hall
opened
and
geoffrey
appeared
at
it
but
without
his
lamp
'hush'
he
said
in
a
sort
of
whisper
and
his
voice
was
harsh
and
stern
'hush
get
to
bed
i
am
working
and
must
not
be
disturbed
go
to
sleep
and
do
not
wake
the
house'
with
a
chill
in
her
heart--for
the
harshness
of
her
husband's
voice
was
new
to
her--she
crept
back
to
bed
and
lay
there
trembling
too
frightened
to
cry
and
listened
to
every
sound
there
was
a
long
pause
of
silence
and
then
the
sound
of
some
iron
implement
striking
muffled
blows
then
there
came
a
clang
of
a
heavy
stone
falling
followed
by
a
muffled
curse
then
a
dragging
sound
and
then
more
noise
of
stone
on
stone
she
lay
all
the
while
in
an
agony
of
fear
and
her
heart
beat
dreadfully
she
heard
a
curious
sort
of
scraping
sound
and
then
there
was
silence
presently
the
door
opened
gently
and
geoffrey
appeared
his
wife
pretended
to
be
asleep
but
through
her
eyelashes
she
saw
him
wash
from
his
hands
something
white
that
looked
like
lime
in
the
morning
he
made
no
allusion
to
the
previous
night
and
she
was
afraid
to
ask
any
question
from
that
day
there
seemed
some
shadow
over
geoffrey
brent
he
neither
ate
nor
slept
as
he
had
been
accustomed
and
his
former
habit
of
turning
suddenly
as
though
someone
were
speaking
from
behind
him
revived
the
old
hall
seemed
to
have
some
kind
of
fascination
for
him
he
used
to
go
there
many
times
in
the
day
but
grew
impatient
if
anyone
even
his
wife
entered
it
when
the
builder's
foreman
came
to
inquire
about
continuing
his
work
geoffrey
was
out
driving
the
man
went
into
the
hall
and
when
geoffrey
returned
the
servant
told
him
of
his
arrival
and
where
he
was
with
a
frightful
oath
he
pushed
the
servant
aside
and
hurried
up
to
the
old
hall
the
workman
met
him
almost
at
the
door
and
as
geoffrey
burst
into
the
room
he
ran
against
him
the
man
apologised
'beg
pardon
sir
but
i
was
just
going
out
to
make
some
enquiries
i
directed
twelve
sacks
of
lime
to
be
sent
here
but
i
see
there
are
only
ten'
'damn
the
ten
sacks
and
the
twelve
too'
was
the
ungracious
and
incomprehensible
rejoinder
the
workman
looked
surprised
and
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
'i
see
sir
there
is
a
little
matter
which
our
people
must
have
done
but
the
governor
will
of
course
see
it
set
right
at
his
own
cost'
'what
do
you
mean'
'that
'ere
'arth-stone
sir
some
idiot
must
have
put
a
scaffold
pole
on
it
and
cracked
it
right
down
the
middle
and
it's
thick
enough
you'd
think
to
stand
hanythink'
geoffrey
was
silent
for
quite
a
minute
and
then
said
in
a
constrained
voice
and
with
much
gentler
manner
'tell
your
people
that
i
am
not
going
on
with
the
work
in
the
hall
at
present
i
want
to
leave
it
as
it
is
for
a
while
longer'
'all
right
sir
i'll
send
up
a
few
of
our
chaps
to
take
away
these
poles
and
lime
bags
and
tidy
the
place
up
a
bit'
'no
no'
said
geoffrey
'leave
them
where
they
are
i
shall
send
and
tell
you
when
you
are
to
get
on
with
the
work'
so
the
foreman
went
away
and
his
comment
to
his
master
was
'i'd
send
in
the
bill
sir
for
the
work
already
done
'pears
to
me
that
money's
a
little
shaky
in
that
quarter'
once
or
twice
delandre
tried
to
stop
brent
on
the
road
and
at
last
finding
that
he
could
not
attain
his
object
rode
after
the
carriage
calling
out
'what
has
become
of
my
sister
your
wife'
geoffrey
lashed
his
horses
into
a
gallop
and
the
other
seeing
from
his
white
face
and
from
his
wife's
collapse
almost
into
a
faint
that
his
object
was
attained
rode
away
with
a
scowl
and
a
laugh
that
night
when
geoffrey
went
into
the
hall
he
passed
over
to
the
great
fireplace
and
all
at
once
started
back
with
a
smothered
cry
then
with
an
effort
he
pulled
himself
together
and
went
away
returning
with
a
light
he
bent
down
over
the
broken
hearth-stone
to
see
if
the
moonlight
falling
through
the
storied
window
had
in
any
way
deceived
him
then
with
a
groan
of
anguish
he
sank
to
his
knees
there
sure
enough
through
the
crack
in
the
broken
stone
were
protruding
a
multitude
of
threads
of
golden
hair
just
tinged
with
grey
he
was
disturbed
by
a
noise
at
the
door
and
looking
round
saw
his
wife
standing
in
the
doorway
in
the
desperation
of
the
moment
he
took
action
to
prevent
discovery
and
lighting
a
match
at
the
lamp
stooped
down
and
burned
away
the
hair
that
rose
through
the
broken
stone
then
rising
nonchalantly
as
he
could
he
pretended
surprise
at
seeing
his
wife
beside
him
for
the
next
week
he
lived
in
an
agony
for
whether
by
accident
or
design
he
could
not
find
himself
alone
in
the
hall
for
any
length
of
time
at
each
visit
the
hair
had
grown
afresh
through
the
crack
and
he
had
to
watch
it
carefully
lest
his
terrible
secret
should
be
discovered
he
tried
to
find
a
receptacle
for
the
body
of
the
murdered
woman
outside
the
house
but
someone
always
interrupted
him
and
once
when
he
was
coming
out
of
the
private
doorway
he
was
met
by
his
wife
who
began
to
question
him
about
it
and
manifested
surprise
that
she
should
not
have
before
noticed
the
key
which
he
now
reluctantly
showed
her
geoffrey
dearly
and
passionately
loved
his
wife
so
that
any
possibility
of
her
discovering
his
dread
secrets
or
even
of
doubting
him
filled
him
with
anguish
and
after
a
couple
of
days
had
passed
he
could
not
help
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
at
least
she
suspected
something
that
very
evening
she
came
into
the
hall
after
her
drive
and
found
him
there
sitting
moodily
by
the
deserted
fireplace
she
spoke
to
him
directly
'geoffrey
i
have
been
spoken
to
by
that
fellow
delandre
and
he
says
horrible
things
he
tells
to
me
that
a
week
ago
his
sister
returned
to
his
house
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
her
former
self
with
only
her
golden
hair
as
of
old
and
announced
some
fell
intention
he
asked
me
where
she
is--and
oh
geoffrey
she
is
dead
she
is
dead
so
how
can
she
have
returned
oh
i
am
in
dread
and
i
know
not
where
to
turn'
for
answer
geoffrey
burst
into
a
torrent
of
blasphemy
which
made
her
shudder
he
cursed
delandre
and
his
sister
and
all
their
kind
and
in
especial
he
hurled
curse
after
curse
on
her
golden
hair
'oh
hush
hush'
she
said
and
was
then
silent
for
she
feared
her
husband
when
she
saw
the
evil
effect
of
his
humour
geoffrey
in
the
torrent
of
his
anger
stood
up
and
moved
away
from
the
hearth
but
suddenly
stopped
as
he
saw
a
new
look
of
terror
in
his
wife's
eyes
he
followed
their
glance
and
then
he
too
shuddered--for
there
on
the
broken
hearth-stone
lay
a
golden
streak
as
the
point
of
the
hair
rose
though
the
crack
'look
look'
she
shrieked
'is
it
some
ghost
of
the
dead
come
away--come
away'
and
seizing
her
husband
by
the
wrist
with
the
frenzy
of
madness
she
pulled
him
from
the
room
that
night
she
was
in
a
raging
fever
the
doctor
of
the
district
attended
her
at
once
and
special
aid
was
telegraphed
for
to
london
geoffrey
was
in
despair
and
in
his
anguish
at
the
danger
of
his
young
wife
almost
forgot
his
own
crime
and
its
consequences
in
the
evening
the
doctor
had
to
leave
to
attend
to
others
but
he
left
geoffrey
in
charge
of
his
wife
his
last
words
were
'remember
you
must
humour
her
till
i
come
in
the
morning
or
till
some
other
doctor
has
her
case
in
hand
what
you
have
to
dread
is
another
attack
of
emotion
see
that
she
is
kept
warm
nothing
more
can
be
done'
late
in
the
evening
when
the
rest
of
the
household
had
retired
geoffrey's
wife
got
up
from
her
bed
and
called
to
her
husband
'come'
she
said
'come
to
the
old
hall
i
know
where
the
gold
comes
from
i
want
to
see
it
grow'
geoffrey
would
fain
have
stopped
her
but
he
feared
for
her
life
or
reason
on
the
one
hand
and
lest
in
a
paroxysm
she
should
shriek
out
her
terrible
suspicion
and
seeing
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
prevent
her
wrapped
a
warm
rug
around
her
and
went
with
her
to
the
old
hall
when
they
entered
she
turned
and
shut
the
door
and
locked
it
'we
want
no
strangers
amongst
us
three
tonight'
she
whispered
with
a
wan
smile
'we
three
nay
we
are
but
two'
said
geoffrey
with
a
shudder
he
feared
to
say
more
'sit
here'
said
his
wife
as
she
put
out
the
light
'sit
here
by
the
hearth
and
watch
the
gold
growing
the
silver
moonlight
is
jealous
see
it
steals
along
the
floor
towards
the
gold--our
gold'
geoffrey
looked
with
growing
horror
and
saw
that
during
the
hours
that
had
passed
the
golden
hair
had
protruded
further
through
the
broken
hearth-stone
he
tried
to
hide
it
by
placing
his
feet
over
the
broken
place
and
his
wife
drawing
her
chair
beside
him
leant
over
and
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
'now
do
not
stir
dear'
she
said
'let
us
sit
still
and
watch
we
shall
find
the
secret
of
the
growing
gold'
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
and
sat
silent
and
as
the
moonlight
stole
along
the
floor
she
sank
to
sleep
he
feared
to
wake
her
and
so
sat
silent
and
miserable
as
the
hours
stole
away
before
his
horror-struck
eyes
the
golden-hair
from
the
broken
stone
grew
and
grew
and
as
it
increased
so
his
heart
got
colder
and
colder
till
at
last
he
had
not
power
to
stir
and
sat
with
eyes
full
of
terror
watching
his
doom





in
the
morning
when
the
london
doctor
came
neither
geoffrey
nor
his
wife
could
be
found
search
was
made
in
all
the
rooms
but
without
avail
as
a
last
resource
the
great
door
of
the
old
hall
was
broken
open
and
those
who
entered
saw
a
grim
and
sorry
sight
there
by
the
deserted
hearth
geoffrey
brent
and
his
young
wife
sat
cold
and
white
and
dead
her
face
was
peaceful
and
her
eyes
were
closed
in
sleep
but
his
face
was
a
sight
that
made
all
who
saw
it
shudder
for
there
was
on
it
a
look
of
unutterable
horror
the
eyes
were
open
and
stared
glassily
at
his
feet
which
were
twined
with
tresses
of
golden
hair
streaked
with
grey
which
came
through
the
broken
hearth-stone
the
gipsy
prophecy
'i
really
think'
said
the
doctor
'that
at
any
rate
one
of
us
should
go
and
try
whether
or
not
the
thing
is
an
imposture'
'good'
said
considine
'after
dinner
we
will
take
our
cigars
and
stroll
over
to
the
camp'
accordingly
when
the
dinner
was
over
and
the
la
tour
finished
joshua
considine
and
his
friend
dr
burleigh
went
over
to
the
east
side
of
the
moor
where
the
gipsy
encampment
lay
as
they
were
leaving
mary
considine
who
had
walked
as
far
as
the
end
of
the
garden
where
it
opened
into
the
laneway
called
after
her
husband
'mind
joshua
you
are
to
give
them
a
fair
chance
but
don't
give
them
any
clue
to
a
fortune--and
don't
you
get
flirting
with
any
of
the
gipsy
maidens--and
take
care
to
keep
gerald
out
of
harm'
for
answer
considine
held
up
his
hand
as
if
taking
a
stage
oath
and
whistled
the
air
of
the
old
song
'the
gipsy
countess'
gerald
joined
in
the
strain
and
then
breaking
into
merry
laughter
the
two
men
passed
along
the
laneway
to
the
common
turning
now
and
then
to
wave
their
hands
to
mary
who
leaned
over
the
gate
in
the
twilight
looking
after
them
it
was
a
lovely
evening
in
the
summer
the
very
air
was
full
of
rest
and
quiet
happiness
as
though
an
outward
type
of
the
peacefulness
and
joy
which
made
a
heaven
of
the
home
of
the
young
married
folk
considine's
life
had
not
been
an
eventful
one
the
only
disturbing
element
which
he
had
ever
known
was
in
his
wooing
of
mary
winston
and
the
long-continued
objection
of
her
ambitious
parents
who
expected
a
brilliant
match
for
their
only
daughter
when
mr
and
mrs
winston
had
discovered
the
attachment
of
the
young
barrister
they
had
tried
to
keep
the
young
people
apart
by
sending
their
daughter
away
for
a
long
round
of
visits
having
made
her
promise
not
to
correspond
with
her
lover
during
her
absence
love
however
had
stood
the
test
neither
absence
nor
neglect
seemed
to
cool
the
passion
of
the
young
man
and
jealousy
seemed
a
thing
unknown
to
his
sanguine
nature
so
after
a
long
period
of
waiting
the
parents
had
given
in
and
the
young
folk
were
married
they
had
been
living
in
the
cottage
a
few
months
and
were
just
beginning
to
feel
at
home
gerald
burleigh
joshua's
old
college
chum
and
himself
a
sometime
victim
of
mary's
beauty
had
arrived
a
week
before
to
stay
with
them
for
as
long
a
time
as
he
could
tear
himself
away
from
his
work
in
london
when
her
husband
had
quite
disappeared
mary
went
into
the
house
and
sitting
down
at
the
piano
gave
an
hour
to
mendelssohn
it
was
but
a
short
walk
across
the
common
and
before
the
cigars
required
renewing
the
two
men
had
reached
the
gipsy
camp
the
place
was
as
picturesque
as
gipsy
camps--when
in
villages
and
when
business
is
good--usually
are
there
were
some
few
persons
round
the
fire
investing
their
money
in
prophecy
and
a
large
number
of
others
poorer
or
more
parsimonious
who
stayed
just
outside
the
bounds
but
near
enough
to
see
all
that
went
on
as
the
two
gentlemen
approached
the
villagers
who
knew
joshua
made
way
a
little
and
a
pretty
keen-eyed
gipsy
girl
tripped
up
and
asked
to
tell
their
fortunes
joshua
held
out
his
hand
but
the
girl
without
seeming
to
see
it
stared
at
his
face
in
a
very
odd
manner
gerald
nudged
him
'you
must
cross
her
hand
with
silver'
he
said
'it
is
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
the
mystery'
joshua
took
from
his
pocket
a
half-crown
and
held
it
out
to
her
but
without
looking
at
it
she
answered
'you
have
to
cross
the
gipsy's
hand
with
gold'
gerald
laughed
'you
are
at
a
premium
as
a
subject'
he
said
joshua
was
of
the
kind
of
man--the
universal
kind--who
can
tolerate
being
stared
at
by
a
pretty
girl
so
with
some
little
deliberation
he
answered
'all
right
here
you
are
my
pretty
girl
but
you
must
give
me
a
real
good
fortune
for
it'
and
he
handed
her
a
half
sovereign
which
she
took
saying
'it
is
not
for
me
to
give
good
fortune
or
bad
but
only
to
read
what
the
stars
have
said'
she
took
his
right
hand
and
turned
it
palm
upward
but
the
instant
her
eyes
met
it
she
dropped
it
as
though
it
had
been
red
hot
and
with
a
startled
look
glided
swiftly
away
lifting
the
curtain
of
the
large
tent
which
occupied
the
centre
of
the
camp
she
disappeared
within
'sold
again'
said
the
cynical
gerald
joshua
stood
a
little
amazed
and
not
altogether
satisfied
they
both
watched
the
large
tent
in
a
few
moments
there
emerged
from
the
opening
not
the
young
girl
but
a
stately
looking
woman
of
middle
age
and
commanding
presence
the
instant
she
appeared
the
whole
camp
seemed
to
stand
still
the
clamour
of
tongues
the
laughter
and
noise
of
the
work
were
for
a
second
or
two
arrested
and
every
man
or
woman
who
sat
or
crouched
or
lay
stood
up
and
faced
the
imperial
looking
gipsy
'the
queen
of
course'
murmured
gerald
'we
are
in
luck
tonight'
the
gipsy
queen
threw
a
searching
glance
around
the
camp
and
then
without
hesitating
an
instant
came
straight
over
and
stood
before
joshua
'hold
out
your
hand'
she
said
in
a
commanding
tone
again
gerald
spoke
sotto
voce
'i
have
not
been
spoken
to
in
that
way
since
i
was
at
school'
'your
hand
must
be
crossed
with
gold'
'a
hundred
per
cent
at
this
game'
whispered
gerald
as
joshua
laid
another
half
sovereign
on
his
upturned
palm
the
gipsy
looked
at
the
hand
with
knitted
brows
then
suddenly
looking
up
into
his
face
said
'have
you
a
strong
will--have
you
a
true
heart
that
can
be
brave
for
one
you
love'
'i
hope
so
but
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
vanity
enough
to
say
yes'
'then
i
will
answer
for
you
for
i
read
resolution
in
your
face--resolution
desperate
and
determined
if
need
be
you
have
a
wife
you
love'
'yes'
emphatically
'then
leave
her
at
once--never
see
her
face
again
go
from
her
now
while
love
is
fresh
and
your
heart
is
free
from
wicked
intent
go
quick--go
far
and
never
see
her
face
again'
joshua
drew
away
his
hand
quickly
and
said
'thank
you'
stiffly
but
sarcastically
as
he
began
to
move
away
'i
say'
said
gerald
'you're
not
going
like
that
old
man
no
use
in
being
indignant
with
the
stars
or
their
prophet--and
moreover
your
sovereign--what
of
it
at
least
hear
the
matter
out'
'silence
ribald'
commanded
the
queen
'you
know
not
what
you
do
let
him
go--and
go
ignorant
if
he
will
not
be
warned'
joshua
immediately
turned
back
'at
all
events
we
will
see
this
thing
out'
he
said
'now
madam
you
have
given
me
advice
but
i
paid
for
a
fortune'
'be
warned'
said
the
gipsy
'the
stars
have
been
silent
for
long
let
the
mystery
still
wrap
them
round'
'my
dear
madam
i
do
not
get
within
touch
of
a
mystery
every
day
and
i
prefer
for
my
money
knowledge
rather
than
ignorance
i
can
get
the
latter
commodity
for
nothing
when
i
want
any
of
it'
gerald
echoed
the
sentiment
'as
for
me
i
have
a
large
and
unsaleable
stock
on
hand'
the
gipsy
queen
eyed
the
two
men
sternly
and
then
said
'as
you
wish
you
have
chosen
for
yourself
and
have
met
warning
with
scorn
and
appeal
with
levity
on
your
own
heads
be
the
doom'
'amen'
said
gerald
with
an
imperious
gesture
the
queen
took
joshua's
hand
again
and
began
to
tell
his
fortune
'i
see
here
the
flowing
of
blood
it
will
flow
before
long
it
is
running
in
my
sight
it
flows
through
the
broken
circle
of
a
severed
ring'
'go
on'
said
joshua
smiling
gerald
was
silent
'must
i
speak
plainer'
'certainly
we
commonplace
mortals
want
something
definite
the
stars
are
a
long
way
off
and
their
words
get
somewhat
dulled
in
the
message'
the
gipsy
shuddered
and
then
spoke
impressively
'this
is
the
hand
of
a
murderer--the
murderer
of
his
wife'
she
dropped
the
hand
and
turned
away
joshua
laughed
'do
you
know'
said
he
'i
think
if
i
were
you
i
should
prophesy
some
jurisprudence
into
my
system
for
instance
you
say
this
hand
is
the
hand
of
a
murderer
well
whatever
it
may
be
in
the
future--or
potentially--it
is
at
present
not
one
you
ought
to
give
your
prophecy
in
such
terms
as
the
hand
which
will
be
a
murderer's
or
rather
the
hand
of
one
who
will
be
the
murderer
of
his
wife
the
stars
are
really
not
good
on
technical
questions'
the
gipsy
made
no
reply
of
any
kind
but
with
drooping
head
and
despondent
mien
walked
slowly
to
her
tent
and
lifting
the
curtain
disappeared
without
speaking
the
two
men
turned
homewards
and
walked
across
the
moor
presently
after
some
little
hesitation
gerald
spoke
'of
course
old
man
this
is
all
a
joke
a
ghastly
one
but
still
a
joke
but
would
it
not
be
well
to
keep
it
to
ourselves'
'how
do
you
mean'
'well
not
tell
your
wife
it
might
alarm
her'
'alarm
her
my
dear
gerald
what
are
you
thinking
of
why
she
would
not
be
alarmed
or
afraid
of
me
if
all
the
gipsies
that
ever
didn't
come
from
bohemia
agreed
that
i
was
to
murder
her
or
even
to
have
a
hard
thought
of
her
whilst
so
long
as
she
was
saying
jack
robinson'
gerald
remonstrated
'old
fellow
women
are
superstitious--far
more
than
we
men
are
and
also
they
are
blessed--or
cursed--with
a
nervous
system
to
which
we
are
strangers
i
see
too
much
of
it
in
my
work
not
to
realise
it
take
my
advice
and
do
not
let
her
know
or
you
will
frighten
her'
joshua's
lips
unconsciously
hardened
as
he
answered
'my
dear
fellow
i
would
not
have
a
secret
from
my
wife
why
it
would
be
the
beginning
of
a
new
order
of
things
between
us
we
have
no
secrets
from
each
other
if
we
ever
have
then
you
may
begin
to
look
out
for
something
odd
between
us'
'still'
said
gerald
'at
the
risk
of
unwelcome
interference
i
say
again
be
warned
in
time'
'the
gipsy's
very
words'
said
joshua
'you
and
she
seem
quite
of
one
accord
tell
me
old
man
is
this
a
put-up
thing
you
told
me
of
the
gipsy
camp--did
you
arrange
it
all
with
her
majesty'
this
was
said
with
an
air
of
bantering
earnestness
gerald
assured
him
that
he
only
heard
of
the
camp
that
morning
but
he
made
fun
of
every
answer
of
his
friend
and
in
the
process
of
this
raillery
the
time
passed
and
they
entered
the
cottage
mary
was
sitting
at
the
piano
but
not
playing
the
dim
twilight
had
waked
some
very
tender
feelings
in
her
breast
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
gentle
tears
when
the
men
came
in
she
stole
over
to
her
husband's
side
and
kissed
him
joshua
struck
a
tragic
attitude
'mary'
he
said
in
a
deep
voice
'before
you
approach
me
listen
to
the
words
of
fate
the
stars
have
spoken
and
the
doom
is
sealed'
'what
is
it
dear
tell
me
the
fortune
but
do
not
frighten
me'
'not
at
all
my
dear
but
there
is
a
truth
which
it
is
well
that
you
should
know
nay
it
is
necessary
so
that
all
your
arrangements
can
be
made
beforehand
and
everything
be
decently
done
and
in
order'
'go
on
dear
i
am
listening'
'mary
considine
your
effigy
may
yet
be
seen
at
madame
tussaud's
the
juris-imprudent
stars
have
announced
their
fell
tidings
that
this
hand
is
red
with
blood--your
blood
mary
mary
my
god'
he
sprang
forward
but
too
late
to
catch
her
as
she
fell
fainting
on
the
floor
'i
told
you'
said
gerald
'you
don't
know
them
as
well
as
i
do'
after
a
little
while
mary
recovered
from
her
swoon
but
only
to
fall
into
strong
hysterics
in
which
she
laughed
and
wept
and
raved
and
cried
'keep
him
from
me--from
me
joshua
my
husband'
and
many
other
words
of
entreaty
and
of
fear
joshua
considine
was
in
a
state
of
mind
bordering
on
agony
and
when
at
last
mary
became
calm
he
knelt
by
her
and
kissed
her
feet
and
hands
and
hair
and
called
her
all
the
sweet
names
and
said
all
the
tender
things
his
lips
could
frame
all
that
night
he
sat
by
her
bedside
and
held
her
hand
far
through
the
night
and
up
to
the
early
morning
she
kept
waking
from
sleep
and
crying
out
as
if
in
fear
till
she
was
comforted
by
the
consciousness
that
her
husband
was
watching
beside
her
breakfast
was
late
the
next
morning
but
during
it
joshua
received
a
telegram
which
required
him
to
drive
over
to
withering
nearly
twenty
miles
he
was
loth
to
go
but
mary
would
not
hear
of
his
remaining
and
so
before
noon
he
drove
off
in
his
dog-cart
alone
when
he
was
gone
mary
retired
to
her
room
she
did
not
appear
at
lunch
but
when
afternoon
tea
was
served
on
the
lawn
under
the
great
weeping
willow
she
came
to
join
her
guest
she
was
looking
quite
recovered
from
her
illness
of
the
evening
before
after
some
casual
remarks
she
said
to
gerald
'of
course
it
was
very
silly
about
last
night
but
i
could
not
help
feeling
frightened
indeed
i
would
feel
so
still
if
i
let
myself
think
of
it
but
after
all
these
people
may
only
imagine
things
and
i
have
got
a
test
that
can
hardly
fail
to
show
that
the
prediction
is
false--if
indeed
it
be
false'
she
added
sadly
'what
is
your
plan'
asked
gerald
'i
shall
go
myself
to
the
gipsy
camp
and
have
my
fortune
told
by
the
queen'
'capital
may
i
go
with
you'
'oh
no
that
would
spoil
it
she
might
know
you
and
guess
at
me
and
suit
her
utterance
accordingly
i
shall
go
alone
this
afternoon'
when
the
afternoon
was
gone
mary
considine
took
her
way
to
the
gipsy
encampment
gerald
went
with
her
as
far
as
the
near
edge
of
the
common
and
returned
alone
half-an-hour
had
hardly
elapsed
when
mary
entered
the
drawing-room
where
he
lay
on
a
sofa
reading
she
was
ghastly
pale
and
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
excitement
hardly
had
she
passed
over
the
threshold
when
she
collapsed
and
sank
moaning
on
the
carpet
gerald
rushed
to
aid
her
but
by
a
great
effort
she
controlled
herself
and
motioned
him
to
be
silent
he
waited
and
his
ready
attention
to
her
wish
seemed
to
be
her
best
help
for
in
a
few
minutes
she
had
somewhat
recovered
and
was
able
to
tell
him
what
had
passed
'when
i
got
to
the
camp'
she
said
'there
did
not
seem
to
be
a
soul
about
i
went
into
the
centre
and
stood
there
suddenly
a
tall
woman
stood
beside
me
something
told
me
i
was
wanted
she
said
i
held
out
my
hand
and
laid
a
piece
of
silver
on
it
she
took
from
her
neck
a
small
golden
trinket
and
laid
it
there
also
and
then
seizing
the
two
threw
them
into
the
stream
that
ran
by
then
she
took
my
hand
in
hers
and
spoke
naught
but
blood
in
this
guilty
place
and
turned
away
i
caught
hold
of
her
and
asked
her
to
tell
me
more
after
some
hesitation
she
said
alas
alas
i
see
you
lying
at
your
husband's
feet
and
his
hands
are
red
with
blood'
gerald
did
not
feel
at
all
at
ease
and
tried
to
laugh
it
off
'surely'
he
said
'this
woman
has
a
craze
about
murder'
'do
not
laugh'
said
mary
'i
cannot
bear
it'
and
then
as
if
with
a
sudden
impulse
she
left
the
room
not
long
after
joshua
returned
bright
and
cheery
and
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
after
his
long
drive
his
presence
cheered
his
wife
who
seemed
much
brighter
but
she
did
not
mention
the
episode
of
the
visit
to
the
gipsy
camp
so
gerald
did
not
mention
it
either
as
if
by
tacit
consent
the
subject
was
not
alluded
to
during
the
evening
but
there
was
a
strange
settled
look
on
mary's
face
which
gerald
could
not
but
observe
in
the
morning
joshua
came
down
to
breakfast
later
than
usual
mary
had
been
up
and
about
the
house
from
an
early
hour
but
as
the
time
drew
on
she
seemed
to
get
a
little
nervous
and
now
and
again
threw
around
an
anxious
look
gerald
could
not
help
noticing
that
none
of
those
at
breakfast
could
get
on
satisfactorily
with
their
food
it
was
not
altogether
that
the
chops
were
tough
but
that
the
knives
were
all
so
blunt
being
a
guest
he
of
course
made
no
sign
but
presently
saw
joshua
draw
his
thumb
across
the
edge
of
his
knife
in
an
unconscious
sort
of
way
at
the
action
mary
turned
pale
and
almost
fainted
after
breakfast
they
all
went
out
on
the
lawn
mary
was
making
up
a
bouquet
and
said
to
her
husband
'get
me
a
few
of
the
tea-roses
dear'
joshua
pulled
down
a
cluster
from
the
front
of
the
house
the
stem
bent
but
was
too
tough
to
break
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
to
get
his
knife
but
in
vain
'lend
me
your
knife
gerald'
he
said
but
gerald
had
not
got
one
so
he
went
into
the
breakfast
room
and
took
one
from
the
table
he
came
out
feeling
its
edge
and
grumbling
'what
on
earth
has
happened
to
all
the
knives--the
edges
seem
all
ground
off'
mary
turned
away
hurriedly
and
entered
the
house
joshua
tried
to
sever
the
stalk
with
the
blunt
knife
as
country
cooks
sever
the
necks
of
fowl--as
schoolboys
cut
twine
with
a
little
effort
he
finished
the
task
the
cluster
of
roses
grew
thick
so
he
determined
to
gather
a
great
bunch
he
could
not
find
a
single
sharp
knife
in
the
sideboard
where
the
cutlery
was
kept
so
he
called
mary
and
when
she
came
told
her
the
state
of
things
she
looked
so
agitated
and
so
miserable
that
he
could
not
help
knowing
the
truth
and
as
if
astounded
and
hurt
asked
her
'do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
done
it'
she
broke
in
'oh
joshua
i
was
so
afraid'
he
paused
and
a
set
white
look
came
over
his
face
'mary'
said
he
'is
this
all
the
trust
you
have
in
me
i
would
not
have
believed
it'
'oh
joshua
joshua'
she
cried
entreatingly
'forgive
me'
and
wept
bitterly
joshua
thought
a
moment
and
then
said
'i
see
how
it
is
we
shall
better
end
this
or
we
shall
all
go
mad'
he
ran
into
the
drawing-room
'where
are
you
going'
almost
screamed
mary
gerald
saw
what
he
meant--that
he
would
not
be
tied
to
blunt
instruments
by
the
force
of
a
superstition
and
was
not
surprised
when
he
saw
him
come
out
through
the
french
window
bearing
in
his
hand
a
large
ghourka
knife
which
usually
lay
on
the
centre
table
and
which
his
brother
had
sent
him
from
northern
india
it
was
one
of
those
great
hunting-knives
which
worked
such
havoc
at
close
quarters
with
the
enemies
of
the
loyal
ghourkas
during
the
mutiny
of
great
weight
but
so
evenly
balanced
in
the
hand
as
to
seem
light
and
with
an
edge
like
a
razor
with
one
of
these
knives
a
ghourka
can
cut
a
sheep
in
two
when
mary
saw
him
come
out
of
the
room
with
the
weapon
in
his
hand
she
screamed
in
an
agony
of
fright
and
the
hysterics
of
last
night
were
promptly
renewed
joshua
ran
toward
her
and
seeing
her
falling
threw
down
the
knife
and
tried
to
catch
her
however
he
was
just
a
second
too
late
and
the
two
men
cried
out
in
horror
simultaneously
as
they
saw
her
fall
upon
the
naked
blade
when
gerald
rushed
over
he
found
that
in
falling
her
left
hand
had
struck
the
blade
which
lay
partly
upwards
on
the
grass
some
of
the
small
veins
were
cut
through
and
the
blood
gushed
freely
from
the
wound
as
he
was
tying
it
up
he
pointed
out
to
joshua
that
the
wedding
ring
was
severed
by
the
steel
they
carried
her
fainting
to
the
house
when
after
a
while
she
came
out
with
her
arm
in
a
sling
she
was
peaceful
in
her
mind
and
happy
she
said
to
her
husband
'the
gipsy
was
wonderfully
near
the
truth
too
near
for
the
real
thing
ever
to
occur
now
dear'
joshua
bent
over
and
kissed
the
wounded
hand
the
coming
of
abel
behenna
the
little
cornish
port
of
pencastle
was
bright
in
the
early
april
when
the
sun
had
seemingly
come
to
stay
after
a
long
and
bitter
winter
boldly
and
blackly
the
rock
stood
out
against
a
background
of
shaded
blue
where
the
sky
fading
into
mist
met
the
far
horizon
the
sea
was
of
true
cornish
hue--sapphire
save
where
it
became
deep
emerald
green
in
the
fathomless
depths
under
the
cliffs
where
the
seal
caves
opened
their
grim
jaws
on
the
slopes
the
grass
was
parched
and
brown
the
spikes
of
furze
bushes
were
ashy
grey
but
the
golden
yellow
of
their
flowers
streamed
along
the
hillside
dipping
out
in
lines
as
the
rock
cropped
up
and
lessening
into
patches
and
dots
till
finally
it
died
away
all
together
where
the
sea
winds
swept
round
the
jutting
cliffs
and
cut
short
the
vegetation
as
though
with
an
ever-working
aerial
shears
the
whole
hillside
with
its
body
of
brown
and
flashes
of
yellow
was
just
like
a
colossal
yellow-hammer
the
little
harbour
opened
from
the
sea
between
towering
cliffs
and
behind
a
lonely
rock
pierced
with
many
caves
and
blow-holes
through
which
the
sea
in
storm
time
sent
its
thunderous
voice
together
with
a
fountain
of
drifting
spume
hence
it
wound
westwards
in
a
serpentine
course
guarded
at
its
entrance
by
two
little
curving
piers
to
left
and
right
these
were
roughly
built
of
dark
slates
placed
endways
and
held
together
with
great
beams
bound
with
iron
bands
thence
it
flowed
up
the
rocky
bed
of
the
stream
whose
winter
torrents
had
of
old
cut
out
its
way
amongst
the
hills
this
stream
was
deep
at
first
with
here
and
there
where
it
widened
patches
of
broken
rock
exposed
at
low
water
full
of
holes
where
crabs
and
lobsters
were
to
be
found
at
the
ebb
of
the
tide
from
amongst
the
rocks
rose
sturdy
posts
used
for
warping
in
the
little
coasting
vessels
which
frequented
the
port
higher
up
the
stream
still
flowed
deeply
for
the
tide
ran
far
inland
but
always
calmly
for
all
the
force
of
the
wildest
storm
was
broken
below
some
quarter
mile
inland
the
stream
was
deep
at
high
water
but
at
low
tide
there
were
at
each
side
patches
of
the
same
broken
rock
as
lower
down
through
the
chinks
of
which
the
sweet
water
of
the
natural
stream
trickled
and
murmured
after
the
tide
had
ebbed
away
here
too
rose
mooring
posts
for
the
fishermen's
boats
at
either
side
of
the
river
was
a
row
of
cottages
down
almost
on
the
level
of
high
tide
they
were
pretty
cottages
strongly
and
snugly
built
with
trim
narrow
gardens
in
front
full
of
old-fashioned
plants
flowering
currants
coloured
primroses
wallflower
and
stonecrop
over
the
fronts
of
many
of
them
climbed
clematis
and
wisteria
the
window
sides
and
door
posts
of
all
were
as
white
as
snow
and
the
little
pathway
to
each
was
paved
with
light
coloured
stones
at
some
of
the
doors
were
tiny
porches
whilst
at
others
were
rustic
seats
cut
from
tree
trunks
or
from
old
barrels
in
nearly
every
case
the
window
ledges
were
filled
with
boxes
or
pots
of
flowers
or
foliage
plants
two
men
lived
in
cottages
exactly
opposite
each
other
across
the
stream
two
men
both
young
both
good-looking
both
prosperous
and
who
had
been
companions
and
rivals
from
their
boyhood
abel
behenna
was
dark
with
the
gypsy
darkness
which
the
phoenician
mining
wanderers
left
in
their
track
eric
sanson--which
the
local
antiquarian
said
was
a
corruption
of
sagamanson--was
fair
with
the
ruddy
hue
which
marked
the
path
of
the
wild
norseman
these
two
seemed
to
have
singled
out
each
other
from
the
very
beginning
to
work
and
strive
together
to
fight
for
each
other
and
to
stand
back
to
back
in
all
endeavours
they
had
now
put
the
coping-stone
on
their
temple
of
unity
by
falling
in
love
with
the
same
girl
sarah
trefusis
was
certainly
the
prettiest
girl
in
pencastle
and
there
was
many
a
young
man
who
would
gladly
have
tried
his
fortune
with
her
but
that
there
were
two
to
contend
against
and
each
of
these
the
strongest
and
most
resolute
man
in
the
port--except
the
other
the
average
young
man
thought
that
this
was
very
hard
and
on
account
of
it
bore
no
good
will
to
either
of
the
three
principals
whilst
the
average
young
woman
who
had
lest
worse
should
befall
to
put
up
with
the
grumbling
of
her
sweetheart
and
the
sense
of
being
only
second
best
which
it
implied
did
not
either
be
sure
regard
sarah
with
friendly
eye
thus
it
came
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
so
for
rustic
courtship
is
a
slow
process
that
the
two
men
and
woman
found
themselves
thrown
much
together
they
were
all
satisfied
so
it
did
not
matter
and
sarah
who
was
vain
and
something
frivolous
took
care
to
have
her
revenge
on
both
men
and
women
in
a
quiet
way
when
a
young
woman
in
her
'walking
out'
can
only
boast
one
not-quite-satisfied
young
man
it
is
no
particular
pleasure
to
her
to
see
her
escort
cast
sheep's
eyes
at
a
better-looking
girl
supported
by
two
devoted
swains
at
length
there
came
a
time
which
sarah
dreaded
and
which
she
had
tried
to
keep
distant--the
time
when
she
had
to
make
her
choice
between
the
two
men
she
liked
them
both
and
indeed
either
of
them
might
have
satisfied
the
ideas
of
even
a
more
exacting
girl
but
her
mind
was
so
constituted
that
she
thought
more
of
what
she
might
lose
than
of
what
she
might
gain
and
whenever
she
thought
she
had
made
up
her
mind
she
became
instantly
assailed
with
doubts
as
to
the
wisdom
of
her
choice
always
the
man
whom
she
had
presumably
lost
became
endowed
afresh
with
a
newer
and
more
bountiful
crop
of
advantages
than
had
ever
arisen
from
the
possibility
of
his
acceptance
she
promised
each
man
that
on
her
birthday
she
would
give
him
his
answer
and
that
day
the
11th
of
april
had
now
arrived
the
promises
had
been
given
singly
and
confidentially
but
each
was
given
to
a
man
who
was
not
likely
to
forget
early
in
the
morning
she
found
both
men
hovering
round
her
door
neither
had
taken
the
other
into
his
confidence
and
each
was
simply
seeking
an
early
opportunity
of
getting
his
answer
and
advancing
his
suit
if
necessary
damon
as
a
rule
does
not
take
pythias
with
him
when
making
a
proposal
and
in
the
heart
of
each
man
his
own
affairs
had
a
claim
far
above
any
requirements
of
friendship
so
throughout
the
day
they
kept
seeing
each
other
out
the
position
was
doubtless
somewhat
embarrassing
to
sarah
and
though
the
satisfaction
of
her
vanity
that
she
should
be
thus
adored
was
very
pleasing
yet
there
were
moments
when
she
was
annoyed
with
both
men
for
being
so
persistent
her
only
consolation
at
such
moments
was
that
she
saw
through
the
elaborate
smiles
of
the
other
girls
when
in
passing
they
noticed
her
door
thus
doubly
guarded
the
jealousy
which
filled
their
hearts
sarah's
mother
was
a
person
of
commonplace
and
sordid
ideas
and
seeing
all
along
the
state
of
affairs
her
one
intention
persistently
expressed
to
her
daughter
in
the
plainest
words
was
to
so
arrange
matters
that
sarah
should
get
all
that
was
possible
out
of
both
men
with
this
purpose
she
had
cunningly
kept
herself
as
far
as
possible
in
the
background
in
the
matter
of
her
daughter's
wooings
and
watched
in
silence
at
first
sarah
had
been
indignant
with
her
for
her
sordid
views
but
as
usual
her
weak
nature
gave
way
before
persistence
and
she
had
now
got
to
the
stage
of
acceptance
she
was
not
surprised
when
her
mother
whispered
to
her
in
the
little
yard
behind
the
house--
'go
up
the
hillside
for
a
while
i
want
to
talk
to
these
two
they're
both
red-hot
for
ye
and
now's
the
time
to
get
things
fixed'
sarah
began
a
feeble
remonstrance
but
her
mother
cut
her
short
'i
tell
ye
girl
that
my
mind
is
made
up
both
these
men
want
ye
and
only
one
can
have
ye
but
before
ye
choose
it'll
be
so
arranged
that
ye'll
have
all
that
both
have
got
don't
argy
child
go
up
the
hillside
and
when
ye
come
back
i'll
have
it
fixed--i
see
a
way
quite
easy'
so
sarah
went
up
the
hillside
through
the
narrow
paths
between
the
golden
furze
and
mrs
trefusis
joined
the
two
men
in
the
living-room
of
the
little
house
she
opened
the
attack
with
the
desperate
courage
which
is
in
all
mothers
when
they
think
for
their
children
howsoever
mean
the
thoughts
may
be
'ye
two
men
ye're
both
in
love
with
my
sarah'
their
bashful
silence
gave
consent
to
the
barefaced
proposition
she
went
on
'neither
of
ye
has
much'
again
they
tacitly
acquiesced
in
the
soft
impeachment
'i
don't
know
that
either
of
ye
could
keep
a
wife'
though
neither
said
a
word
their
looks
and
bearing
expressed
distinct
dissent
mrs
trefusis
went
on
'but
if
ye'd
put
what
ye
both
have
together
ye'd
make
a
comfortable
home
for
one
of
ye--and
sarah'
she
eyed
the
men
keenly
with
her
cunning
eyes
half
shut
as
she
spoke
then
satisfied
from
her
scrutiny
that
the
idea
was
accepted
she
went
on
quickly
as
if
to
prevent
argument
'the
girl
likes
ye
both
and
mayhap
it's
hard
for
her
to
choose
why
don't
ye
toss
up
for
her
first
put
your
money
together--ye've
each
got
a
bit
put
by
i
know
let
the
lucky
man
take
the
lot
and
trade
with
it
a
bit
and
then
come
home
and
marry
her
neither
of
ye's
afraid
i
suppose
and
neither
of
ye'll
say
that
he
won't
do
that
much
for
the
girl
that
ye
both
say
ye
love'
abel
broke
the
silence
'it
don't
seem
the
square
thing
to
toss
for
the
girl
she
wouldn't
like
it
herself
and
it
doesn't
seem--seem
respectful
like
to
her--'
eric
interrupted
he
was
conscious
that
his
chance
was
not
so
good
as
abel's
in
case
sarah
should
wish
to
choose
between
them
'are
ye
afraid
of
the
hazard'
'not
me'
said
abel
boldly
mrs
trefusis
seeing
that
her
idea
was
beginning
to
work
followed
up
the
advantage
'it
is
settled
that
ye
put
yer
money
together
to
make
a
home
for
her
whether
ye
toss
for
her
or
leave
it
for
her
to
choose'
'yes'
said
eric
quickly
and
abel
agreed
with
equal
sturdiness
mrs
trefusis'
little
cunning
eyes
twinkled
she
heard
sarah's
step
in
the
yard
and
said
'well
here
she
comes
and
i
leave
it
to
her'
and
she
went
out
during
her
brief
walk
on
the
hillside
sarah
had
been
trying
to
make
up
her
mind
she
was
feeling
almost
angry
with
both
men
for
being
the
cause
of
her
difficulty
and
as
she
came
into
the
room
said
shortly
'i
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
both--come
to
the
flagstaff
rock
where
we
can
be
alone'
she
took
her
hat
and
went
out
of
the
house
up
the
winding
path
to
the
steep
rock
crowned
with
a
high
flagstaff
where
once
the
wreckers'
fire
basket
used
to
burn
this
was
the
rock
which
formed
the
northern
jaw
of
the
little
harbour
there
was
only
room
on
the
path
for
two
abreast
and
it
marked
the
state
of
things
pretty
well
when
by
a
sort
of
implied
arrangement
sarah
went
first
and
the
two
men
followed
walking
abreast
and
keeping
step
by
this
time
each
man's
heart
was
boiling
with
jealousy
when
they
came
to
the
top
of
the
rock
sarah
stood
against
the
flagstaff
and
the
two
young
men
stood
opposite
her
she
had
chosen
her
position
with
knowledge
and
intention
for
there
was
no
room
for
anyone
to
stand
beside
her
they
were
all
silent
for
a
while
then
sarah
began
to
laugh
and
said--
'i
promised
the
both
of
you
to
give
you
an
answer
to-day
i've
been
thinking
and
thinking
and
thinking
till
i
began
to
get
angry
with
you
both
for
plaguing
me
so
and
even
now
i
don't
seem
any
nearer
than
ever
i
was
to
making
up
my
mind'
eric
said
suddenly
'let
us
toss
for
it
lass'
sarah
showed
no
indignation
whatever
at
the
proposition
her
mother's
eternal
suggestion
had
schooled
her
to
the
acceptance
of
something
of
the
kind
and
her
weak
nature
made
it
easy
to
her
to
grasp
at
any
way
out
of
the
difficulty
she
stood
with
downcast
eyes
idly
picking
at
the
sleeve
of
her
dress
seeming
to
have
tacitly
acquiesced
in
the
proposal
both
men
instinctively
realising
this
pulled
each
a
coin
from
his
pocket
spun
it
in
the
air
and
dropped
his
other
hand
over
the
palm
on
which
it
lay
for
a
few
seconds
they
remained
thus
all
silent
then
abel
who
was
the
more
thoughtful
of
the
men
spoke
'sarah
is
this
good'
as
he
spoke
he
removed
the
upper
hand
from
the
coin
and
placed
the
latter
back
in
his
pocket
sarah
was
nettled
'good
or
bad
it's
good
enough
for
me
take
it
or
leave
it
as
you
like'
she
said
to
which
he
replied
quickly
'nay
lass
aught
that
concerns
you
is
good
enow
for
me
i
did
but
think
of
you
lest
you
might
have
pain
or
disappointment
hereafter
if
you
love
eric
better
nor
me
in
god's
name
say
so
and
i
think
i'm
man
enow
to
stand
aside
likewise
if
i'm
the
one
don't
make
us
both
miserable
for
life'
face
to
face
with
a
difficulty
sarah's
weak
nature
proclaimed
itself
she
put
her
hands
before
her
face
and
began
to
cry
saying--
'it
was
my
mother
she
keeps
telling
me'
the
silence
which
followed
was
broken
by
eric
who
said
hotly
to
abel
'let
the
lass
alone
can't
you
if
she
wants
to
choose
this
way
let
her
it's
good
enough
for
me--and
for
you
too
she's
said
it
now
and
must
abide
by
it'
hereupon
sarah
turned
upon
him
in
sudden
fury
and
cried
'hold
your
tongue
what
is
it
to
you
at
any
rate'
and
she
resumed
her
crying
eric
was
so
flabbergasted
that
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
but
stood
looking
particularly
foolish
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
hands
held
out
with
the
coin
still
between
them
all
were
silent
till
sarah
taking
her
hands
from
her
face
laughed
hysterically
and
said
'as
you
two
can't
make
up
your
minds
i'm
going
home'
and
she
turned
to
go
'stop'
said
abel
in
an
authoritative
voice
'eric
you
hold
the
coin
and
i'll
cry
now
before
we
settle
it
let
us
clearly
understand
the
man
who
wins
takes
all
the
money
that
we
both
have
got
brings
it
to
bristol
and
ships
on
a
voyage
and
trades
with
it
then
he
comes
back
and
marries
sarah
and
they
two
keep
all
whatever
there
may
be
as
the
result
of
the
trading
is
this
what
we
understand'
'yes'
said
eric
'i'll
marry
him
on
my
next
birthday'
said
sarah
having
said
it
the
intolerably
mercenary
spirit
of
her
action
seemed
to
strike
her
and
impulsively
she
turned
away
with
a
bright
blush
fire
seemed
to
sparkle
in
the
eyes
of
both
men
said
eric
'a
year
so
be
the
man
that
wins
is
to
have
one
year'
'toss'
cried
abel
and
the
coin
spun
in
the
air
eric
caught
it
and
again
held
it
between
his
outstretched
hands
'heads'
cried
abel
a
pallor
sweeping
over
his
face
as
he
spoke
as
he
leaned
forward
to
look
sarah
leaned
forward
too
and
their
heads
almost
touched
he
could
feel
her
hair
blowing
on
his
cheek
and
it
thrilled
through
him
like
fire
eric
lifted
his
upper
hand
the
coin
lay
with
its
head
up
abel
stepped
forward
and
took
sarah
in
his
arms
with
a
curse
eric
hurled
the
coin
far
into
the
sea
then
he
leaned
against
the
flagstaff
and
scowled
at
the
others
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
pockets
abel
whispered
wild
words
of
passion
and
delight
into
sarah's
ears
and
as
she
listened
she
began
to
believe
that
fortune
had
rightly
interpreted
the
wishes
of
her
secret
heart
and
that
she
loved
abel
best
presently
abel
looked
up
and
caught
sight
of
eric's
face
as
the
last
ray
of
sunset
struck
it
the
red
light
intensified
the
natural
ruddiness
of
his
complexion
and
he
looked
as
though
he
were
steeped
in
blood
abel
did
not
mind
his
scowl
for
now
that
his
own
heart
was
at
rest
he
could
feel
unalloyed
pity
for
his
friend
he
stepped
over
meaning
to
comfort
him
and
held
out
his
hand
saying
'it
was
my
chance
old
lad
don't
grudge
it
me
i'll
try
to
make
sarah
a
happy
woman
and
you
shall
be
a
brother
to
us
both'
'brother
be
damned'
was
all
the
answer
eric
made
as
he
turned
away
when
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
down
the
rocky
path
he
turned
and
came
back
standing
before
abel
and
sarah
who
had
their
arms
round
each
other
he
said
'you
have
a
year
make
the
most
of
it
and
be
sure
you're
in
time
to
claim
your
wife
be
back
to
have
your
banns
up
in
time
to
be
married
on
the
11th
april
if
you're
not
i
tell
you
i
shall
have
my
banns
up
and
you
may
get
back
too
late'
'what
do
you
mean
eric
you
are
mad'
'no
more
mad
than
you
are
abel
behenna
you
go
that's
your
chance
i
stay
that's
mine
i
don't
mean
to
let
the
grass
grow
under
my
feet
sarah
cared
no
more
for
you
than
for
me
five
minutes
ago
and
she
may
come
back
to
that
five
minutes
after
you're
gone
you
won
by
a
point
only--the
game
may
change'
'the
game
won't
change'
said
abel
shortly
'sarah
you'll
be
true
to
me
you
won't
marry
till
i
return'
'for
a
year'
added
eric
quickly
'that's
the
bargain'
'i
promise
for
the
year'
said
sarah
a
dark
look
came
over
abel's
face
and
he
was
about
to
speak
but
he
mastered
himself
and
smiled
'i
mustn't
be
too
hard
or
get
angry
tonight
come
eric
we
played
and
fought
together
i
won
fairly
i
played
fairly
all
the
game
of
our
wooing
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
and
now
when
i
am
going
away
i
shall
look
to
my
old
and
true
comrade
to
help
me
when
i
am
gone'
'i'll
help
you
none'
said
eric
'so
help
me
god'
'it
was
god
helped
me'
said
abel
simply
'then
let
him
go
on
helping
you'
said
eric
angrily
'the
devil
is
good
enough
for
me'
and
without
another
word
he
rushed
down
the
steep
path
and
disappeared
behind
the
rocks
when
he
had
gone
abel
hoped
for
some
tender
passage
with
sarah
but
the
first
remark
she
made
chilled
him
'how
lonely
it
all
seems
without
eric'
and
this
note
sounded
till
he
had
left
her
at
home--and
after
early
on
the
next
morning
abel
heard
a
noise
at
his
door
and
on
going
out
saw
eric
walking
rapidly
away
a
small
canvas
bag
full
of
gold
and
silver
lay
on
the
threshold
on
a
small
slip
of
paper
pinned
to
it
was
written
'take
the
money
and
go
i
stay
god
for
you
the
devil
for
me
remember
the
11th
of
april--eric
sanson'
that
afternoon
abel
went
off
to
bristol
and
a
week
later
sailed
on
the
star
of
the
sea
bound
for
pahang
his
money--including
that
which
had
been
eric's--was
on
board
in
the
shape
of
a
venture
of
cheap
toys
he
had
been
advised
by
a
shrewd
old
mariner
of
bristol
whom
he
knew
and
who
knew
the
ways
of
the
chersonese
who
predicted
that
every
penny
invested
would
be
returned
with
a
shilling
to
boot
as
the
year
wore
on
sarah
became
more
and
more
disturbed
in
her
mind
eric
was
always
at
hand
to
make
love
to
her
in
his
own
persistent
masterful
manner
and
to
this
she
did
not
object
only
one
letter
came
from
abel
to
say
that
his
venture
had
proved
successful
and
that
he
had
sent
some
two
hundred
pounds
to
the
bank
at
bristol
and
was
trading
with
fifty
pounds
still
remaining
in
goods
for
china
whither
the
star
of
the
sea
was
bound
and
whence
she
would
return
to
bristol
he
suggested
that
eric's
share
of
the
venture
should
be
returned
to
him
with
his
share
of
the
profits
this
proposition
was
treated
with
anger
by
eric
and
as
simply
childish
by
sarah's
mother
more
than
six
months
had
since
then
elapsed
but
no
other
letter
had
come
and
eric's
hopes
which
had
been
dashed
down
by
the
letter
from
pahang
began
to
rise
again
he
perpetually
assailed
sarah
with
an
'if'
if
abel
did
not
return
would
she
then
marry
him
if
the
11th
april
went
by
without
abel
being
in
the
port
would
she
give
him
over
if
abel
had
taken
his
fortune
and
married
another
girl
on
the
head
of
it
would
she
marry
him
eric
as
soon
as
the
truth
were
known
and
so
on
in
an
endless
variety
of
possibilities
the
power
of
the
strong
will
and
the
determined
purpose
over
the
woman's
weaker
nature
became
in
time
manifest
sarah
began
to
lose
her
faith
in
abel
and
to
regard
eric
as
a
possible
husband
and
a
possible
husband
is
in
a
woman's
eye
different
to
all
other
men
a
new
affection
for
him
began
to
arise
in
her
breast
and
the
daily
familiarities
of
permitted
courtship
furthered
the
growing
affection
sarah
began
to
regard
abel
as
rather
a
rock
in
the
road
of
her
life
and
had
it
not
been
for
her
mother's
constantly
reminding
her
of
the
good
fortune
already
laid
by
in
the
bristol
bank
she
would
have
tried
to
have
shut
her
eyes
altogether
to
the
fact
of
abel's
existence
the
11th
april
was
saturday
so
that
in
order
to
have
the
marriage
on
that
day
it
would
be
necessary
that
the
banns
should
be
called
on
sunday
22nd
march
from
the
beginning
of
that
month
eric
kept
perpetually
on
the
subject
of
abel's
absence
and
his
outspoken
opinion
that
the
latter
was
either
dead
or
married
began
to
become
a
reality
to
the
woman's
mind
as
the
first
half
of
the
month
wore
on
eric
became
more
jubilant
and
after
church
on
the
15th
he
took
sarah
for
a
walk
to
the
flagstaff
rock
there
he
asserted
himself
strongly
'i
told
abel
and
you
too
that
if
he
was
not
here
to
put
up
his
banns
in
time
for
the
eleventh
i
would
put
up
mine
for
the
twelfth
now
the
time
has
come
when
i
mean
to
do
it
he
hasn't
kept
his
word'--here
sarah
struck
in
out
of
her
weakness
and
indecision
'he
hasn't
broken
it
yet'
eric
ground
his
teeth
with
anger
'if
you
mean
to
stick
up
for
him'
he
said
as
he
smote
his
hands
savagely
on
the
flagstaff
which
sent
forth
a
shivering
murmur
'well
and
good
i'll
keep
my
part
of
the
bargain
on
sunday
i
shall
give
notice
of
the
banns
and
you
can
deny
them
in
the
church
if
you
will
if
abel
is
in
pencastle
on
the
eleventh
he
can
have
them
cancelled
and
his
own
put
up
but
till
then
i
take
my
course
and
woe
to
anyone
who
stands
in
my
way'
with
that
he
flung
himself
down
the
rocky
pathway
and
sarah
could
not
but
admire
his
viking
strength
and
spirit
as
crossing
the
hill
he
strode
away
along
the
cliffs
towards
bude
during
the
week
no
news
was
heard
of
abel
and
on
saturday
eric
gave
notice
of
the
banns
of
marriage
between
himself
and
sarah
trefusis
the
clergyman
would
have
remonstrated
with
him
for
although
nothing
formal
had
been
told
to
the
neighbours
it
had
been
understood
since
abel's
departure
that
on
his
return
he
was
to
marry
sarah
but
eric
would
not
discuss
the
question
'it
is
a
painful
subject
sir'
he
said
with
a
firmness
which
the
parson
who
was
a
very
young
man
could
not
but
be
swayed
by
'surely
there
is
nothing
against
sarah
or
me
why
should
there
be
any
bones
made
about
the
matter'
the
parson
said
no
more
and
on
the
next
day
he
read
out
the
banns
for
the
first
time
amidst
an
audible
buzz
from
the
congregation
sarah
was
present
contrary
to
custom
and
though
she
blushed
furiously
enjoyed
her
triumph
over
the
other
girls
whose
banns
had
not
yet
come
before
the
week
was
over
she
began
to
make
her
wedding
dress
eric
used
to
come
and
look
at
her
at
work
and
the
sight
thrilled
through
him
he
used
to
say
all
sorts
of
pretty
things
to
her
at
such
times
and
there
were
to
both
delicious
moments
of
love-making
the
banns
were
read
a
second
time
on
the
29th
and
eric's
hope
grew
more
and
more
fixed
though
there
were
to
him
moments
of
acute
despair
when
he
realised
that
the
cup
of
happiness
might
be
dashed
from
his
lips
at
any
moment
right
up
to
the
last
at
such
times
he
was
full
of
passion--desperate
and
remorseless--and
he
ground
his
teeth
and
clenched
his
hands
in
a
wild
way
as
though
some
taint
of
the
old
berserker
fury
of
his
ancestors
still
lingered
in
his
blood
on
the
thursday
of
that
week
he
looked
in
on
sarah
and
found
her
amid
a
flood
of
sunshine
putting
finishing
touches
to
her
white
wedding
gown
his
own
heart
was
full
of
gaiety
and
the
sight
of
the
woman
who
was
so
soon
to
be
his
own
so
occupied
filled
him
with
a
joy
unspeakable
and
he
felt
faint
with
languorous
ecstasy
bending
over
he
kissed
sarah
on
the
mouth
and
then
whispered
in
her
rosy
ear--
'your
wedding
dress
sarah
and
for
me'
as
he
drew
back
to
admire
her
she
looked
up
saucily
and
said
to
him--
'perhaps
not
for
you
there
is
more
than
a
week
yet
for
abel'
and
then
cried
out
in
dismay
for
with
a
wild
gesture
and
a
fierce
oath
eric
dashed
out
of
the
house
banging
the
door
behind
him
the
incident
disturbed
sarah
more
than
she
could
have
thought
possible
for
it
awoke
all
her
fears
and
doubts
and
indecision
afresh
she
cried
a
little
and
put
by
her
dress
and
to
soothe
herself
went
out
to
sit
for
a
while
on
the
summit
of
the
flagstaff
rock
when
she
arrived
she
found
there
a
little
group
anxiously
discussing
the
weather
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
sun
bright
but
across
the
sea
were
strange
lines
of
darkness
and
light
and
close
in
to
shore
the
rocks
were
fringed
with
foam
which
spread
out
in
great
white
curves
and
circles
as
the
currents
drifted
the
wind
had
backed
and
came
in
sharp
cold
puffs
the
blow-hole
which
ran
under
the
flagstaff
rock
from
the
rocky
bay
without
to
the
harbour
within
was
booming
at
intervals
and
the
seagulls
were
screaming
ceaselessly
as
they
wheeled
about
the
entrance
of
the
port
'it
looks
bad'
she
heard
an
old
fisherman
say
to
the
coastguard
'i
seen
it
just
like
this
once
before
when
the
east
indiaman
coromandel
went
to
pieces
in
dizzard
bay'
sarah
did
not
wait
to
hear
more
she
was
of
a
timid
nature
where
danger
was
concerned
and
could
not
bear
to
hear
of
wrecks
and
disasters
she
went
home
and
resumed
the
completion
of
her
dress
secretly
determined
to
appease
eric
when
she
should
meet
him
with
a
sweet
apology--and
to
take
the
earliest
opportunity
of
being
even
with
him
after
her
marriage
the
old
fisherman's
weather
prophecy
was
justified
that
night
at
dusk
a
wild
storm
came
on
the
sea
rose
and
lashed
the
western
coasts
from
skye
to
scilly
and
left
a
tale
of
disaster
everywhere
the
sailors
and
fishermen
of
pencastle
all
turned
out
on
the
rocks
and
cliffs
and
watched
eagerly
presently
by
a
flash
of
lightning
a
'ketch'
was
seen
drifting
under
only
a
jib
about
half-a-mile
outside
the
port
all
eyes
and
all
glasses
were
concentrated
on
her
waiting
for
the
next
flash
and
when
it
came
a
chorus
went
up
that
it
was
the
lovely
alice
trading
between
bristol
and
penzance
and
touching
at
all
the
little
ports
between
'god
help
them'
said
the
harbour-master
'for
nothing
in
this
world
can
save
them
when
they
are
between
bude
and
tintagel
and
the
wind
on
shore'
the
coastguards
exerted
themselves
and
aided
by
brave
hearts
and
willing
hands
they
brought
the
rocket
apparatus
up
on
the
summit
of
the
flagstaff
rock
then
they
burned
blue
lights
so
that
those
on
board
might
see
the
harbour
opening
in
case
they
could
make
any
effort
to
reach
it
they
worked
gallantly
enough
on
board
but
no
skill
or
strength
of
man
could
avail
before
many
minutes
were
over
the
lovely
alice
rushed
to
her
doom
on
the
great
island
rock
that
guarded
the
mouth
of
the
port
the
screams
of
those
on
board
were
faintly
borne
on
the
tempest
as
they
flung
themselves
into
the
sea
in
a
last
chance
for
life
the
blue
lights
were
kept
burning
and
eager
eyes
peered
into
the
depths
of
the
waters
in
case
any
face
could
be
seen
and
ropes
were
held
ready
to
fling
out
in
aid
but
never
a
face
was
seen
and
the
willing
arms
rested
idle
eric
was
there
amongst
his
fellows
his
old
icelandic
origin
was
never
more
apparent
than
in
that
wild
hour
he
took
a
rope
and
shouted
in
the
ear
of
the
harbour-master
'i
shall
go
down
on
the
rock
over
the
seal
cave
the
tide
is
running
up
and
someone
may
drift
in
there'
'keep
back
man'
came
the
answer
'are
you
mad
one
slip
on
that
rock
and
you
are
lost
and
no
man
could
keep
his
feet
in
the
dark
on
such
a
place
in
such
a
tempest'
'not
a
bit'
came
the
reply
'you
remember
how
abel
behenna
saved
me
there
on
a
night
like
this
when
my
boat
went
on
the
gull
rock
he
dragged
me
up
from
the
deep
water
in
the
seal
cave
and
now
someone
may
drift
in
there
again
as
i
did'
and
he
was
gone
into
the
darkness
the
projecting
rock
hid
the
light
on
the
flagstaff
rock
but
he
knew
his
way
too
well
to
miss
it
his
boldness
and
sureness
of
foot
standing
to
him
he
shortly
stood
on
the
great
round-topped
rock
cut
away
beneath
by
the
action
of
the
waves
over
the
entrance
of
the
seal
cave
where
the
water
was
fathomless
there
he
stood
in
comparative
safety
for
the
concave
shape
of
the
rock
beat
back
the
waves
with
their
own
force
and
though
the
water
below
him
seemed
to
boil
like
a
seething
cauldron
just
beyond
the
spot
there
was
a
space
of
almost
calm
the
rock
too
seemed
here
to
shut
off
the
sound
of
the
gale
and
he
listened
as
well
as
watched
as
he
stood
there
ready
with
his
coil
of
rope
poised
to
throw
he
thought
he
heard
below
him
just
beyond
the
whirl
of
the
water
a
faint
despairing
cry
he
echoed
it
with
a
shout
that
rang
into
the
night
then
he
waited
for
the
flash
of
lightning
and
as
it
passed
flung
his
rope
out
into
the
darkness
where
he
had
seen
a
face
rising
through
the
swirl
of
the
foam
the
rope
was
caught
for
he
felt
a
pull
on
it
and
he
shouted
again
in
his
mighty
voice
'tie
it
round
your
waist
and
i
shall
pull
you
up'
then
when
he
felt
that
it
was
fast
he
moved
along
the
rock
to
the
far
side
of
the
sea
cave
where
the
deep
water
was
something
stiller
and
where
he
could
get
foothold
secure
enough
to
drag
the
rescued
man
on
the
overhanging
rock
he
began
to
pull
and
shortly
he
knew
from
the
rope
taken
in
that
the
man
he
was
now
rescuing
must
soon
be
close
to
the
top
of
the
rock
he
steadied
himself
for
a
moment
and
drew
a
long
breath
that
he
might
at
the
next
effort
complete
the
rescue
he
had
just
bent
his
back
to
the
work
when
a
flash
of
lightning
revealed
to
each
other
the
two
men--the
rescuer
and
the
rescued
eric
sanson
and
abel
behenna
were
face
to
face--and
none
knew
of
the
meeting
save
themselves
and
god
on
the
instant
a
wave
of
passion
swept
through
eric's
heart
all
his
hopes
were
shattered
and
with
the
hatred
of
cain
his
eyes
looked
out
he
saw
in
the
instant
of
recognition
the
joy
in
abel's
face
that
his
was
the
hand
to
succour
him
and
this
intensified
his
hate
whilst
the
passion
was
on
him
he
started
back
and
the
rope
ran
out
between
his
hands
his
moment
of
hate
was
followed
by
an
impulse
of
his
better
manhood
but
it
was
too
late
before
he
could
recover
himself
abel
encumbered
with
the
rope
that
should
have
aided
him
was
plunged
with
a
despairing
cry
back
into
the
darkness
of
the
devouring
sea
then
feeling
all
the
madness
and
the
doom
of
cain
upon
him
eric
rushed
back
over
the
rocks
heedless
of
the
danger
and
eager
only
for
one
thing--to
be
amongst
other
people
whose
living
noises
would
shut
out
that
last
cry
which
seemed
to
ring
still
in
his
ears
when
he
regained
the
flagstaff
rock
the
men
surrounded
him
and
through
the
fury
of
the
storm
he
heard
the
harbour-master
say--
'we
feared
you
were
lost
when
we
heard
a
cry
how
white
you
are
where
is
your
rope
was
there
anyone
drifted
in'
'no
one'
he
shouted
in
answer
for
he
felt
that
he
could
never
explain
that
he
had
let
his
old
comrade
slip
back
into
the
sea
and
at
the
very
place
and
under
the
very
circumstances
in
which
that
comrade
had
saved
his
own
life
he
hoped
by
one
bold
lie
to
set
the
matter
at
rest
for
ever
there
was
no
one
to
bear
witness--and
if
he
should
have
to
carry
that
still
white
face
in
his
eyes
and
that
despairing
cry
in
his
ears
for
evermore--at
least
none
should
know
of
it
'no
one'
he
cried
more
loudly
still
'i
slipped
on
the
rock
and
the
rope
fell
into
the
sea'
so
saying
he
left
them
and
rushing
down
the
steep
path
gained
his
own
cottage
and
locked
himself
within
the
remainder
of
that
night
he
passed
lying
on
his
bed--dressed
and
motionless--staring
upwards
and
seeming
to
see
through
the
darkness
a
pale
face
gleaming
wet
in
the
lightning
with
its
glad
recognition
turning
to
ghastly
despair
and
to
hear
a
cry
which
never
ceased
to
echo
in
his
soul
in
the
morning
the
storm
was
over
and
all
was
smiling
again
except
that
the
sea
was
still
boisterous
with
its
unspent
fury
great
pieces
of
wreck
drifted
into
the
port
and
the
sea
around
the
island
rock
was
strewn
with
others
two
bodies
also
drifted
into
the
harbour--one
the
master
of
the
wrecked
ketch
the
other
a
strange
seaman
whom
no
one
knew
sarah
saw
nothing
of
eric
till
the
evening
and
then
he
only
looked
in
for
a
minute
he
did
not
come
into
the
house
but
simply
put
his
head
in
through
the
open
window
'well
sarah'
he
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
though
to
her
it
did
not
ring
truly
'is
the
wedding
dress
done
sunday
week
mind
sunday
week'
sarah
was
glad
to
have
the
reconciliation
so
easy
but
womanlike
when
she
saw
the
storm
was
over
and
her
own
fears
groundless
she
at
once
repeated
the
cause
of
offence
'sunday
so
be
it'
she
said
without
looking
up
'if
abel
isn't
there
on
saturday'
then
she
looked
up
saucily
though
her
heart
was
full
of
fear
of
another
outburst
on
the
part
of
her
impetuous
lover
but
the
window
was
empty
eric
had
taken
himself
off
and
with
a
pout
she
resumed
her
work
she
saw
eric
no
more
till
sunday
afternoon
after
the
banns
had
been
called
the
third
time
when
he
came
up
to
her
before
all
the
people
with
an
air
of
proprietorship
which
half-pleased
and
half-annoyed
her
'not
yet
mister'
she
said
pushing
him
away
as
the
other
girls
giggled
'wait
till
sunday
next
if
you
please--the
day
after
saturday'
she
added
looking
at
him
saucily
the
girls
giggled
again
and
the
young
men
guffawed
they
thought
it
was
the
snub
that
touched
him
so
that
he
became
as
white
as
a
sheet
as
he
turned
away
but
sarah
who
knew
more
than
they
did
laughed
for
she
saw
triumph
through
the
spasm
of
pain
that
overspread
his
face
the
week
passed
uneventfully
however
as
saturday
drew
nigh
sarah
had
occasional
moments
of
anxiety
and
as
to
eric
he
went
about
at
night-time
like
a
man
possessed
he
restrained
himself
when
others
were
by
but
now
and
again
he
went
down
amongst
the
rocks
and
caves
and
shouted
aloud
this
seemed
to
relieve
him
somewhat
and
he
was
better
able
to
restrain
himself
for
some
time
after
all
saturday
he
stayed
in
his
own
house
and
never
left
it
as
he
was
to
be
married
on
the
morrow
the
neighbours
thought
it
was
shyness
on
his
part
and
did
not
trouble
or
notice
him
only
once
was
he
disturbed
and
that
was
when
the
chief
boatman
came
to
him
and
sat
down
and
after
a
pause
said
'eric
i
was
over
in
bristol
yesterday
i
was
in
the
ropemaker's
getting
a
coil
to
replace
the
one
you
lost
the
night
of
the
storm
and
there
i
saw
michael
heavens
of
this
place
who
is
a
salesman
there
he
told
me
that
abel
behenna
had
come
home
the
week
ere
last
on
the
star
of
the
sea
from
canton
and
that
he
had
lodged
a
sight
of
money
in
the
bristol
bank
in
the
name
of
sarah
behenna
he
told
michael
so
himself--and
that
he
had
taken
passage
on
the
lovely
alice
to
pencastle
'bear
up
man'
for
eric
had
with
a
groan
dropped
his
head
on
his
knees
with
his
face
between
his
hands
'he
was
your
old
comrade
i
know
but
you
couldn't
help
him
he
must
have
gone
down
with
the
rest
that
awful
night
i
thought
i'd
better
tell
you
lest
it
might
come
some
other
way
and
you
might
keep
sarah
trefusis
from
being
frightened
they
were
good
friends
once
and
women
take
these
things
to
heart
it
would
not
do
to
let
her
be
pained
with
such
a
thing
on
her
wedding
day'
then
he
rose
and
went
away
leaving
eric
still
sitting
disconsolately
with
his
head
on
his
knees
'poor
fellow'
murmured
the
chief
boatman
to
himself
'he
takes
it
to
heart
well
well
right
enough
they
were
true
comrades
once
and
abel
saved
him'
the
afternoon
of
that
day
when
the
children
had
left
school
they
strayed
as
usual
on
half-holidays
along'
the
quay
and
the
paths
by
the
cliffs
presently
some
of
them
came
running
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
to
the
harbour
where
a
few
men
were
unloading
a
coal
ketch
and
a
great
many
were
superintending
the
operation
one
of
the
children
called
out
'there
is
a
porpoise
in
the
harbour
mouth
we
saw
it
come
through
the
blow-hole
it
had
a
long
tail
and
was
deep
under
the
water'
'it
was
no
porpoise'
said
another
'it
was
a
seal
but
it
had
a
long
tail
it
came
out
of
the
seal
cave'
the
other
children
bore
various
testimony
but
on
two
points
they
were
unanimous--it
whatever
'it'
was
had
come
through
the
blow-hole
deep
under
the
water
and
had
a
long
thin
tail--a
tail
so
long
that
they
could
not
see
the
end
of
it
there
was
much
unmerciful
chaffing
of
the
children
by
the
men
on
this
point
but
as
it
was
evident
that
they
had
seen
something
quite
a
number
of
persons
young
and
old
male
and
female
went
along
the
high
paths
on
either
side
of
the
harbour
mouth
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
this
new
addition
to
the
fauna
of
the
sea
a
long-tailed
porpoise
or
seal
the
tide
was
now
coming
in
there
was
a
slight
breeze
and
the
surface
of
the
water
was
rippled
so
that
it
was
only
at
moments
that
anyone
could
see
clearly
into
the
deep
water
after
a
spell
of
watching
a
woman
called
out
that
she
saw
something
moving
up
the
channel
just
below
where
she
was
standing
there
was
a
stampede
to
the
spot
but
by
the
time
the
crowd
had
gathered
the
breeze
had
freshened
and
it
was
impossible
to
see
with
any
distinctness
below
the
surface
of
the
water
on
being
questioned
the
woman
described
what
she
had
seen
but
in
such
an
incoherent
way
that
the
whole
thing
was
put
down
as
an
effect
of
imagination
had
it
not
been
for
the
children's
report
she
would
not
have
been
credited
at
all
her
semi-hysterical
statement
that
what
she
saw
was
'like
a
pig
with
the
entrails
out'
was
only
thought
anything
of
by
an
old
coastguard
who
shook
his
head
but
did
not
make
any
remark
for
the
remainder
of
the
daylight
this
man
was
seen
always
on
the
bank
looking
into
the
water
but
always
with
disappointment
manifest
on
his
face
eric
arose
early
on
the
next
morning--he
had
not
slept
all
night
and
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
move
about
in
the
light
he
shaved
himself
with
a
hand
that
did
not
tremble
and
dressed
himself
in
his
wedding
clothes
there
was
a
haggard
look
on
his
face
and
he
seemed
as
though
he
had
grown
years
older
in
the
last
few
days
still
there
was
a
wild
uneasy
light
of
triumph
in
his
eyes
and
he
kept
murmuring
to
himself
over
and
over
again
'this
is
my
wedding-day
abel
cannot
claim
her
now--living
or
dead--living
or
dead
living
or
dead'
he
sat
in
his
arm-chair
waiting
with
an
uncanny
quietness
for
the
church
hour
to
arrive
when
the
bell
began
to
ring
he
arose
and
passed
out
of
his
house
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
looked
at
the
river
and
saw
the
tide
had
just
turned
in
the
church
he
sat
with
sarah
and
her
mother
holding
sarah's
hand
tightly
in
his
all
the
time
as
though
he
feared
to
lose
her
when
the
service
was
over
they
stood
up
together
and
were
married
in
the
presence
of
the
entire
congregation
for
no
one
left
the
church
both
made
the
responses
clearly--eric's
being
even
on
the
defiant
side
when
the
wedding
was
over
sarah
took
her
husband's
arm
and
they
walked
away
together
the
boys
and
younger
girls
being
cuffed
by
their
elders
into
a
decorous
behaviour
for
they
would
fain
have
followed
close
behind
their
heels
the
way
from
the
church
led
down
to
the
back
of
eric's
cottage
a
narrow
passage
being
between
it
and
that
of
his
next
neighbour
when
the
bridal
couple
had
passed
through
this
the
remainder
of
the
congregation
who
had
followed
them
at
a
little
distance
were
startled
by
a
long
shrill
scream
from
the
bride
they
rushed
through
the
passage
and
found
her
on
the
bank
with
wild
eyes
pointing
to
the
river
bed
opposite
eric
sanson's
door
the
falling
tide
had
deposited
there
the
body
of
abel
behenna
stark
upon
the
broken
rocks
the
rope
trailing
from
its
waist
had
been
twisted
by
the
current
round
the
mooring
post
and
had
held
it
back
whilst
the
tide
had
ebbed
away
from
it
the
right
elbow
had
fallen
in
a
chink
in
the
rock
leaving
the
hand
outstretched
toward
sarah
with
the
open
palm
upward
as
though
it
were
extended
to
receive
hers
the
pale
drooping
fingers
open
to
the
clasp
all
that
happened
afterwards
was
never
quite
known
to
sarah
sanson
whenever
she
would
try
to
recollect
there
would
become
a
buzzing
in
her
ears
and
a
dimness
in
her
eyes
and
all
would
pass
away
the
only
thing
that
she
could
remember
of
it
all--and
this
she
never
forgot--was
eric's
breathing
heavily
with
his
face
whiter
than
that
of
the
dead
man
as
he
muttered
under
his
breath
'devil's
help
devil's
faith
devil's
price'
the
burial
of
the
rats
leaving
paris
by
the
orleans
road
cross
the
enceinte
and
turning
to
the
right
you
find
yourself
in
a
somewhat
wild
and
not
at
all
savoury
district
right
and
left
before
and
behind
on
every
side
rise
great
heaps
of
dust
and
waste
accumulated
by
the
process
of
time
paris
has
its
night
as
well
as
its
day
life
and
the
sojourner
who
enters
his
hotel
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
or
the
rue
st
honore
late
at
night
or
leaves
it
early
in
the
morning
can
guess
in
coming
near
montrouge--if
he
has
not
done
so
already--the
purpose
of
those
great
waggons
that
look
like
boilers
on
wheels
which
he
finds
halting
everywhere
as
he
passes
every
city
has
its
peculiar
institutions
created
out
of
its
own
needs
and
one
of
the
most
notable
institutions
of
paris
is
its
rag-picking
population
in
the
early
morning--and
parisian
life
commences
at
an
early
hour--may
be
seen
in
most
streets
standing
on
the
pathway
opposite
every
court
and
alley
and
between
every
few
houses
as
still
in
some
american
cities
even
in
parts
of
new
york
large
wooden
boxes
into
which
the
domestics
or
tenement-holders
empty
the
accumulated
dust
of
the
past
day
round
these
boxes
gather
and
pass
on
when
the
work
is
done
to
fresh
fields
of
labour
and
pastures
new
squalid
hungry-looking
men
and
women
the
implements
of
whose
craft
consist
of
a
coarse
bag
or
basket
slung
over
the
shoulder
and
a
little
rake
with
which
they
turn
over
and
probe
and
examine
in
the
minutest
manner
the
dustbins
they
pick
up
and
deposit
in
their
baskets
by
aid
of
their
rakes

they
may
find
with
the
same
facility
as
a

uses
his

paris
is
a
city
of
centralisation--and
centralisation
and
classification
are
closely
allied
in
the
early
times
when
centralisation
is
becoming
a
fact
its
forerunner
is
classification
all
things
which
are
similar
or
analogous
become
grouped
together
and
from
the
grouping
of
groups
rises
one
whole
or
central
point
we
see
radiating
many
long
arms
with
innumerable
tentaculae
and
in
the
centre
rises
a
gigantic
head
with
a
comprehensive
brain
and
keen
eyes
to
look
on
every
side
and
ears
sensitive
to
hear--and
a
voracious
mouth
to
swallow
other
cities
resemble
all
the
birds
and
beasts
and
fishes
whose
appetites
and
digestions
are
normal
paris
alone
is
the
analogical
apotheosis
of
the
octopus
product
of
centralisation
carried
to
an
ad
absurdum
it
fairly
represents
the
devil
fish
and
in
no
respects
is
the
resemblance
more
curious
than
in
the
similarity
of
the
digestive
apparatus
those
intelligent
tourists
who
having
surrendered
their
individuality
into
the
hands
of
messrs
cook
or
gaze
'do'
paris
in
three
days
are
often
puzzled
to
know
how
it
is
that
the
dinner
which
in
london
would
cost
about
six
shillings
can
be
had
for
three
francs
in
a
cafã©
in
the
palais
royal
they
need
have
no
more
wonder
if
they
will
but
consider
the
classification
which
is
a
theoretic
speciality
of
parisian
life
and
adopt
all
round
the
fact
from
which
the
chiffonier
has
his
genesis
the
paris
of
1850
was
not
like
the
paris
of
to-day
and
those
who
see
the
paris
of
napoleon
and
baron
hausseman
can
hardly
realise
the
existence
of
the
state
of
things
forty-five
years
ago
amongst
other
things
however
which
have
not
changed
are
those
districts
where
the
waste
is
gathered
dust
is
dust
all
the
world
over
in
every
age
and
the
family
likeness
of
dust-heaps
is
perfect
the
traveller
therefore
who
visits
the
environs
of
montrouge
can
go
go
back
in
fancy
without
difficulty
to
the
year
1850
in
this
year
i
was
making
a
prolonged
stay
in
paris
i
was
very
much
in
love
with
a
young
lady
who
though
she
returned
my
passion
so
far
yielded
to
the
wishes
of
her
parents
that
she
had
promised
not
to
see
me
or
to
correspond
with
me
for
a
year
i
too
had
been
compelled
to
accede
to
these
conditions
under
a
vague
hope
of
parental
approval
during
the
term
of
probation
i
had
promised
to
remain
out
of
the
country
and
not
to
write
to
my
dear
one
until
the
expiration
of
the
year
naturally
the
time
went
heavily
with
me
there
was
not
one
of
my
own
family
or
circle
who
could
tell
me
of
alice
and
none
of
her
own
folk
had
i
am
sorry
to
say
sufficient
generosity
to
send
me
even
an
occasional
word
of
comfort
regarding
her
health
and
well-being
i
spent
six
months
wandering
about
europe
but
as
i
could
find
no
satisfactory
distraction
in
travel
i
determined
to
come
to
paris
where
at
least
i
would
be
within
easy
hail
of
london
in
case
any
good
fortune
should
call
me
thither
before
the
appointed
time
that
'hope
deferred
maketh
the
heart
sick'
was
never
better
exemplified
than
in
my
case
for
in
addition
to
the
perpetual
longing
to
see
the
face
i
loved
there
was
always
with
me
a
harrowing
anxiety
lest
some
accident
should
prevent
me
showing
alice
in
due
time
that
i
had
throughout
the
long
period
of
probation
been
faithful
to
her
trust
and
my
own
love
thus
every
adventure
which
i
undertook
had
a
fierce
pleasure
of
its
own
for
it
was
fraught
with
possible
consequences
greater
than
it
would
have
ordinarily
borne
like
all
travellers
i
exhausted
the
places
of
most
interest
in
the
first
month
of
my
stay
and
was
driven
in
the
second
month
to
look
for
amusement
whithersoever
i
might
having
made
sundry
journeys
to
the
better-known
suburbs
i
began
to
see
that
there
was
a
terra
incognita
in
so
far
as
the
guide
book
was
concerned
in
the
social
wilderness
lying
between
these
attractive
points
accordingly
i
began
to
systematise
my
researches
and
each
day
took
up
the
thread
of
my
exploration
at
the
place
where
i
had
on
the
previous
day
dropped
it
in
the
process
of
time
my
wanderings
led
me
near
montrouge
and
i
saw
that
hereabouts
lay
the
ultima
thule
of
social
exploration--a
country
as
little
known
as
that
round
the
source
of
the
white
nile
and
so
i
determined
to
investigate
philosophically
the
chiffonier--his
habitat
his
life
and
his
means
of
life
the
job
was
an
unsavoury
one
difficult
of
accomplishment
and
with
little
hope
of
adequate
reward
however
despite
reason
obstinacy
prevailed
and
i
entered
into
my
new
investigation
with
a
keener
energy
than
i
could
have
summoned
to
aid
me
in
any
investigation
leading
to
any
end
valuable
or
worthy
one
day
late
in
a
fine
afternoon
toward
the
end
of
september
i
entered
the
holy
of
holies
of
the
city
of
dust
the
place
was
evidently
the
recognised
abode
of
a
number
of
chiffoniers
for
some
sort
of
arrangement
was
manifested
in
the
formation
of
the
dust
heaps
near
the
road
i
passed
amongst
these
heaps
which
stood
like
orderly
sentries
determined
to
penetrate
further
and
trace
dust
to
its
ultimate
location
as
i
passed
along
i
saw
behind
the
dust
heaps
a
few
forms
that
flitted
to
and
fro
evidently
watching
with
interest
the
advent
of
any
stranger
to
such
a
place
the
district
was
like
a
small
switzerland
and
as
i
went
forward
my
tortuous
course
shut
out
the
path
behind
me
presently
i
got
into
what
seemed
a
small
city
or
community
of
chiffoniers
there
were
a
number
of
shanties
or
huts
such
as
may
be
met
with
in
the
remote
parts
of
the
bog
of
allan--rude
places
with
wattled
walls
plastered
with
mud
and
roofs
of
rude
thatch
made
from
stable
refuse--such
places
as
one
would
not
like
to
enter
for
any
consideration
and
which
even
in
water-colour
could
only
look
picturesque
if
judiciously
treated
in
the
midst
of
these
huts
was
one
of
the
strangest
adaptations--i
cannot
say
habitations--i
had
ever
seen
an
immense
old
wardrobe
the
colossal
remnant
of
some
boudoir
of
charles
vii
or
henry
ii
had
been
converted
into
a
dwelling-house
the
double
doors
lay
open
so
that
the
entire
mã©nage
was
open
to
public
view
in
the
open
half
of
the
wardrobe
was
a
common
sitting-room
of
some
four
feet
by
six
in
which
sat
smoking
their
pipes
round
a
charcoal
brazier
no
fewer
than
six
old
soldiers
of
the
first
republic
with
their
uniforms
torn
and
worn
threadbare
evidently
they
were
of
the
mauvais
sujet
class
their
bleary
eyes
and
limp
jaws
told
plainly
of
a
common
love
of
absinthe
and
their
eyes
had
that
haggard
worn
look
of
slumbering
ferocity
which
follows
hard
in
the
wake
of
drink
the
other
side
stood
as
of
old
with
its
shelves
intact
save
that
they
were
cut
to
half
their
depth
and
in
each
shelf
of
which
there
were
six
was
a
bed
made
with
rags
and
straw
the
half-dozen
of
worthies
who
inhabited
this
structure
looked
at
me
curiously
as
i
passed
and
when
i
looked
back
after
going
a
little
way
i
saw
their
heads
together
in
a
whispered
conference
i
did
not
like
the
look
of
this
at
all
for
the
place
was
very
lonely
and
the
men
looked
very
very
villainous
however
i
did
not
see
any
cause
for
fear
and
went
on
my
way
penetrating
further
and
further
into
the
sahara
the
way
was
tortuous
to
a
degree
and
from
going
round
in
a
series
of
semi-circles
as
one
goes
in
skating
with
the
dutch
roll
i
got
rather
confused
with
regard
to
the
points
of
the
compass
when
i
had
penetrated
a
little
way
i
saw
as
i
turned
the
corner
of
a
half-made
heap
sitting
on
a
heap
of
straw
an
old
soldier
with
threadbare
coat
'hallo'
said
i
to
myself
'the
first
republic
is
well
represented
here
in
its
soldiery'
as
i
passed
him
the
old
man
never
even
looked
up
at
me
but
gazed
on
the
ground
with
stolid
persistency
again
i
remarked
to
myself
'see
what
a
life
of
rude
warfare
can
do
this
old
man's
curiosity
is
a
thing
of
the
past'
when
i
had
gone
a
few
steps
however
i
looked
back
suddenly
and
saw
that
curiosity
was
not
dead
for
the
veteran
had
raised
his
head
and
was
regarding
me
with
a
very
queer
expression
he
seemed
to
me
to
look
very
like
one
of
the
six
worthies
in
the
press
when
he
saw
me
looking
he
dropped
his
head
and
without
thinking
further
of
him
i
went
on
my
way
satisfied
that
there
was
a
strange
likeness
between
these
old
warriors
presently
i
met
another
old
soldier
in
a
similar
manner
he
too
did
not
notice
me
whilst
i
was
passing
by
this
time
it
was
getting
late
in
the
afternoon
and
i
began
to
think
of
retracing
my
steps
accordingly
i
turned
to
go
back
but
could
see
a
number
of
tracks
leading
between
different
mounds
and
could
not
ascertain
which
of
them
i
should
take
in
my
perplexity
i
wanted
to
see
someone
of
whom
to
ask
the
way
but
could
see
no
one
i
determined
to
go
on
a
few
mounds
further
and
so
try
to
see
someone--not
a
veteran
i
gained
my
object
for
after
going
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
i
saw
before
me
a
single
shanty
such
as
i
had
seen
before--with
however
the
difference
that
this
was
not
one
for
living
in
but
merely
a
roof
with
three
walls
open
in
front
from
the
evidences
which
the
neighbourhood
exhibited
i
took
it
to
be
a
place
for
sorting
within
it
was
an
old
woman
wrinkled
and
bent
with
age
i
approached
her
to
ask
the
way
she
rose
as
i
came
close
and
i
asked
her
my
way
she
immediately
commenced
a
conversation
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
here
in
the
very
centre
of
the
kingdom
of
dust
was
the
place
to
gather
details
of
the
history
of
parisian
rag-picking--particularly
as
i
could
do
so
from
the
lips
of
one
who
looked
like
the
oldest
inhabitant
i
began
my
inquiries
and
the
old
woman
gave
me
most
interesting
answers--she
had
been
one
of
the
ceteuces
who
sat
daily
before
the
guillotine
and
had
taken
an
active
part
among
the
women
who
signalised
themselves
by
their
violence
in
the
revolution
while
we
were
talking
she
said
suddenly
'but
m'sieur
must
be
tired
standing'
and
dusted
a
rickety
old
stool
for
me
to
sit
down
i
hardly
liked
to
do
so
for
many
reasons
but
the
poor
old
woman
was
so
civil
that
i
did
not
like
to
run
the
risk
of
hurting
her
by
refusing
and
moreover
the
conversation
of
one
who
had
been
at
the
taking
of
the
bastille
was
so
interesting
that
i
sat
down
and
so
our
conversation
went
on
while
we
were
talking
an
old
man--older
and
more
bent
and
wrinkled
even
than
the
woman--appeared
from
behind
the
shanty
'here
is
pierre'
said
she
'm'sieur
can
hear
stories
now
if
he
wishes
for
pierre
was
in
everything
from
the
bastille
to
waterloo'
the
old
man
took
another
stool
at
my
request
and
we
plunged
into
a
sea
of
revolutionary
reminiscences
this
old
man
albeit
clothed
like
a
scarecrow
was
like
any
one
of
the
six
veterans
i
was
now
sitting
in
the
centre
of
the
low
hut
with
the
woman
on
my
left
hand
and
the
man
on
my
right
each
of
them
being
somewhat
in
front
of
me
the
place
was
full
of
all
sorts
of
curious
objects
of
lumber
and
of
many
things
that
i
wished
far
away
in
one
corner
was
a
heap
of
rags
which
seemed
to
move
from
the
number
of
vermin
it
contained
and
in
the
other
a
heap
of
bones
whose
odour
was
something
shocking
every
now
and
then
glancing
at
the
heaps
i
could
see
the
gleaming
eyes
of
some
of
the
rats
which
infested
the
place
these
loathsome
objects
were
bad
enough
but
what
looked
even
more
dreadful
was
an
old
butcher's
axe
with
an
iron
handle
stained
with
clots
of
blood
leaning
up
against
the
wall
on
the
right
hand
side
still
these
things
did
not
give
me
much
concern
the
talk
of
the
two
old
people
was
so
fascinating
that
i
stayed
on
and
on
till
the
evening
came
and
the
dust
heaps
threw
dark
shadows
over
the
vales
between
them
after
a
time
i
began
to
grow
uneasy
i
could
not
tell
how
or
why
but
somehow
i
did
not
feel
satisfied
uneasiness
is
an
instinct
and
means
warning
the
psychic
faculties
are
often
the
sentries
of
the
intellect
and
when
they
sound
alarm
the
reason
begins
to
act
although
perhaps
not
consciously
this
was
so
with
me
i
began
to
bethink
me
where
i
was
and
by
what
surrounded
and
to
wonder
how
i
should
fare
in
case
i
should
be
attacked
and
then
the
thought
suddenly
burst
upon
me
although
without
any
overt
cause
that
i
was
in
danger
prudence
whispered
'be
still
and
make
no
sign'
and
so
i
was
still
and
made
no
sign
for
i
knew
that
four
cunning
eyes
were
on
me
'four
eyes--if
not
more'
my
god
what
a
horrible
thought
the
whole
shanty
might
be
surrounded
on
three
sides
with
villains
i
might
be
in
the
midst
of
a
band
of
such
desperadoes
as
only
half
a
century
of
periodic
revolution
can
produce
with
a
sense
of
danger
my
intellect
and
observation
quickened
and
i
grew
more
watchful
than
was
my
wont
i
noticed
that
the
old
woman's
eyes
were
constantly
wandering
towards
my
hands
i
looked
at
them
too
and
saw
the
cause--my
rings
on
my
left
little
finger
i
had
a
large
signet
and
on
the
right
a
good
diamond
i
thought
that
if
there
was
any
danger
my
first
care
was
to
avert
suspicion
accordingly
i
began
to
work
the
conversation
round
to
rag-picking--to
the
drains--of
the
things
found
there
and
so
by
easy
stages
to
jewels
then
seizing
a
favourable
opportunity
i
asked
the
old
woman
if
she
knew
anything
of
such
things
she
answered
that
she
did
a
little
i
held
out
my
right
hand
and
showing
her
the
diamond
asked
her
what
she
thought
of
that
she
answered
that
her
eyes
were
bad
and
stooped
over
my
hand
i
said
as
nonchalantly
as
i
could
'pardon
me
you
will
see
better
thus'
and
taking
it
off
handed
it
to
her
an
unholy
light
came
into
her
withered
old
face
as
she
touched
it
she
stole
one
glance
at
me
swift
and
keen
as
a
flash
of
lightning
she
bent
over
the
ring
for
a
moment
her
face
quite
concealed
as
though
examining
it
the
old
man
looked
straight
out
of
the
front
of
the
shanty
before
him
at
the
same
time
fumbling
in
his
pockets
and
producing
a
screw
of
tobacco
in
a
paper
and
a
pipe
which
he
proceeded
to
fill
i
took
advantage
of
the
pause
and
the
momentary
rest
from
the
searching
eyes
on
my
face
to
look
carefully
round
the
place
now
dim
and
shadowy
in
the
gloaming
there
still
lay
all
the
heaps
of
varied
reeking
foulness
there
the
terrible
blood-stained
axe
leaning
against
the
wall
in
the
right
hand
corner
and
everywhere
despite
the
gloom
the
baleful
glitter
of
the
eyes
of
the
rats
i
could
see
them
even
through
some
of
the
chinks
of
the
boards
at
the
back
low
down
close
to
the
ground
but
stay
these
latter
eyes
seemed
more
than
usually
large
and
bright
and
baleful
for
an
instant
my
heart
stood
still
and
i
felt
in
that
whirling
condition
of
mind
in
which
one
feels
a
sort
of
spiritual
drunkenness
and
as
though
the
body
is
only
maintained
erect
in
that
there
is
no
time
for
it
to
fall
before
recovery
then
in
another
second
i
was
calm--coldly
calm
with
all
my
energies
in
full
vigour
with
a
self-control
which
i
felt
to
be
perfect
and
with
all
my
feeling
and
instincts
alert
now
i
knew
the
full
extent
of
my
danger
i
was
watched
and
surrounded
by
desperate
people
i
could
not
even
guess
at
how
many
of
them
were
lying
there
on
the
ground
behind
the
shanty
waiting
for
the
moment
to
strike
i
knew
that
i
was
big
and
strong
and
they
knew
it
too
they
knew
also
as
i
did
that
i
was
an
englishman
and
would
make
a
fight
for
it
and
so
we
waited
i
had
i
felt
gained
an
advantage
in
the
last
few
seconds
for
i
knew
my
danger
and
understood
the
situation
now
i
thought
is
the
test
of
my
courage--the
enduring
test
the
fighting
test
may
come
later
the
old
woman
raised
her
head
and
said
to
me
in
a
satisfied
kind
of
way
'a
very
fine
ring
indeed--a
beautiful
ring
oh
me
i
once
had
such
rings
plenty
of
them
and
bracelets
and
earrings
oh
for
in
those
fine
days
i
led
the
town
a
dance
but
they've
forgotten
me
now
they've
forgotten
me
they
why
they
never
heard
of
me
perhaps
their
grandfathers
remember
me
some
of
them'
and
she
laughed
a
harsh
croaking
laugh
and
then
i
am
bound
to
say
that
she
astonished
me
for
she
handed
me
back
the
ring
with
a
certain
suggestion
of
old-fashioned
grace
which
was
not
without
its
pathos
the
old
man
eyed
her
with
a
sort
of
sudden
ferocity
half
rising
from
his
stool
and
said
to
me
suddenly
and
hoarsely
'let
me
see'
i
was
about
to
hand
the
ring
when
the
old
woman
said
'no
no
do
not
give
it
to
pierre
pierre
is
eccentric
he
loses
things
and
such
a
pretty
ring'
'cat'
said
the
old
man
savagely
suddenly
the
old
woman
said
rather
more
loudly
than
was
necessary
'wait
i
shall
tell
you
something
about
a
ring'
there
was
something
in
the
sound
of
her
voice
that
jarred
upon
me
perhaps
it
was
my
hyper-sensitiveness
wrought
up
as
i
was
to
such
a
pitch
of
nervous
excitement
but
i
seemed
to
think
that
she
was
not
addressing
me
as
i
stole
a
glance
round
the
place
i
saw
the
eyes
of
the
rats
in
the
bone
heaps
but
missed
the
eyes
along
the
back
but
even
as
i
looked
i
saw
them
again
appear
the
old
woman's
'wait'
had
given
me
a
respite
from
attack
and
the
men
had
sunk
back
to
their
reclining
posture
'i
once
lost
a
ring--a
beautiful
diamond
hoop
that
had
belonged
to
a
queen
and
which
was
given
to
me
by
a
farmer
of
the
taxes
who
afterwards
cut
his
throat
because
i
sent
him
away
i
thought
it
must
have
been
stolen
and
taxed
my
people
but
i
could
get
no
trace
the
police
came
and
suggested
that
it
had
found
its
way
to
the
drain
we
descended--i
in
my
fine
clothes
for
i
would
not
trust
them
with
my
beautiful
ring
i
know
more
of
the
drains
since
then
and
of
rats
too
but
i
shall
never
forget
the
horror
of
that
place--alive
with
blazing
eyes
a
wall
of
them
just
outside
the
light
of
our
torches
well
we
got
beneath
my
house
we
searched
the
outlet
of
the
drain
and
there
in
the
filth
found
my
ring
and
we
came
out
'but
we
found
something
else
also
before
we
came
as
we
were
coming
toward
the
opening
a
lot
of
sewer
rats--human
ones
this
time--came
towards
us
they
told
the
police
that
one
of
their
number
had
gone
into
the
drain
but
had
not
returned
he
had
gone
in
only
shortly
before
we
had
and
if
lost
could
hardly
be
far
off
they
asked
help
to
seek
him
so
we
turned
back
they
tried
to
prevent
me
going
but
i
insisted
it
was
a
new
excitement
and
had
i
not
recovered
my
ring
not
far
did
we
go
till
we
came
on
something
there
was
but
little
water
and
the
bottom
of
the
drain
was
raised
with
brick
rubbish
and
much
matter
of
the
kind
he
had
made
a
fight
for
it
even
when
his
torch
had
gone
out
but
they
were
too
many
for
him
they
had
not
been
long
about
it
the
bones
were
still
warm
but
they
were
picked
clean
they
had
even
eaten
their
own
dead
ones
and
there
were
bones
of
rats
as
well
as
of
the
man
they
took
it
cool
enough
those
other--the
human
ones--and
joked
of
their
comrade
when
they
found
him
dead
though
they
would
have
helped
him
living
bah
what
matters
it--life
or
death'
'and
had
you
no
fear'
i
asked
her
'fear'
she
said
with
a
laugh
'me
have
fear
ask
pierre
but
i
was
younger
then
and
as
i
came
through
that
horrible
drain
with
its
wall
of
greedy
eyes
always
moving
with
the
circle
of
the
light
from
the
torches
i
did
not
feel
easy
i
kept
on
before
the
men
though
it
is
a
way
i
have
i
never
let
the
men
get
it
before
me
all
i
want
is
a
chance
and
a
means
and
they
ate
him
up--took
every
trace
away
except
the
bones
and
no
one
knew
it
nor
no
sound
of
him
was
ever
heard'
here
she
broke
into
a
chuckling
fit
of
the
ghastliest
merriment
which
it
was
ever
my
lot
to
hear
and
see
a
great
poetess
describes
her
heroine
singing
'oh
to
see
or
hear
her
singing
scarce
i
know
which
is
the
divinest'
and
i
can
apply
the
same
idea
to
the
old
crone--in
all
save
the
divinity
for
i
scarce
could
tell
which
was
the
most
hellish--the
harsh
malicious
satisfied
cruel
laugh
or
the
leering
grin
and
the
horrible
square
opening
of
the
mouth
like
a
tragic
mask
and
the
yellow
gleam
of
the
few
discoloured
teeth
in
the
shapeless
gums
in
that
laugh
and
with
that
grin
and
the
chuckling
satisfaction
i
knew
as
well
as
if
it
had
been
spoken
to
me
in
words
of
thunder
that
my
murder
was
settled
and
the
murderers
only
bided
the
proper
time
for
its
accomplishment
i
could
read
between
the
lines
of
her
gruesome
story
the
commands
to
her
accomplices
'wait'
she
seemed
to
say
'bide
your
time
i
shall
strike
the
first
blow
find
the
weapon
for
me
and
i
shall
make
the
opportunity
he
shall
not
escape
keep
him
quiet
and
then
no
one
will
be
wiser
there
will
be
no
outcry
and
the
rats
will
do
their
work'
it
was
growing
darker
and
darker
the
night
was
coming
i
stole
a
glance
round
the
shanty
still
all
the
same
the
bloody
axe
in
the
corner
the
heaps
of
filth
and
the
eyes
on
the
bone
heaps
and
in
the
crannies
of
the
floor
pierre
had
been
still
ostensibly
filling
his
pipe
he
now
struck
a
light
and
began
to
puff
away
at
it
the
old
woman
said
'dear
heart
how
dark
it
is
pierre
like
a
good
lad
light
the
lamp'
pierre
got
up
and
with
the
lighted
match
in
his
hand
touched
the
wick
of
a
lamp
which
hung
at
one
side
of
the
entrance
to
the
shanty
and
which
had
a
reflector
that
threw
the
light
all
over
the
place
it
was
evidently
that
which
was
used
for
their
sorting
at
night
'not
that
stupid
not
that
the
lantern'
she
called
out
to
him
he
immediately
blew
it
out
saying
'all
right
mother
i'll
find
it'
and
he
hustled
about
the
left
corner
of
the
room--the
old
woman
saying
through
the
darkness
'the
lantern
the
lantern
oh
that
is
the
light
that
is
most
useful
to
us
poor
folks
the
lantern
was
the
friend
of
the
revolution
it
is
the
friend
of
the
chiffonier
it
helps
us
when
all
else
fails'
hardly
had
she
said
the
word
when
there
was
a
kind
of
creaking
of
the
whole
place
and
something
was
steadily
dragged
over
the
roof
again
i
seemed
to
read
between
the
lines
of
her
words
i
knew
the
lesson
of
the
lantern
'one
of
you
get
on
the
roof
with
a
noose
and
strangle
him
as
he
passes
out
if
we
fail
within'
as
i
looked
out
of
the
opening
i
saw
the
loop
of
a
rope
outlined
black
against
the
lurid
sky
i
was
now
indeed
beset
pierre
was
not
long
in
finding
the
lantern
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
through
the
darkness
on
the
old
woman
pierre
struck
his
light
and
by
its
flash
i
saw
the
old
woman
raise
from
the
ground
beside
her
where
it
had
mysteriously
appeared
and
then
hide
in
the
folds
of
her
gown
a
long
sharp
knife
or
dagger
it
seemed
to
be
like
a
butcher's
sharpening
iron
fined
to
a
keen
point
the
lantern
was
lit
'bring
it
here
pierre'
she
said
'place
it
in
the
doorway
where
we
can
see
it
see
how
nice
it
is
it
shuts
out
the
darkness
from
us
it
is
just
right'
just
right
for
her
and
her
purposes
it
threw
all
its
light
on
my
face
leaving
in
gloom
the
faces
of
both
pierre
and
the
woman
who
sat
outside
of
me
on
each
side
i
felt
that
the
time
of
action
was
approaching
but
i
knew
now
that
the
first
signal
and
movement
would
come
from
the
woman
and
so
watched
her
i
was
all
unarmed
but
i
had
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
at
the
first
movement
i
would
seize
the
butcher's
axe
in
the
right-hand
corner
and
fight
my
way
out
at
least
i
would
die
hard
i
stole
a
glance
round
to
fix
its
exact
locality
so
that
i
could
not
fail
to
seize
it
at
the
first
effort
for
then
if
ever
time
and
accuracy
would
be
precious
good
god
it
was
gone
all
the
horror
of
the
situation
burst
upon
me
but
the
bitterest
thought
of
all
was
that
if
the
issue
of
the
terrible
position
should
be
against
me
alice
would
infallibly
suffer
either
she
would
believe
me
false--and
any
lover
or
any
one
who
has
ever
been
one
can
imagine
the
bitterness
of
the
thought--or
else
she
would
go
on
loving
long
after
i
had
been
lost
to
her
and
to
the
world
so
that
her
life
would
be
broken
and
embittered
shattered
with
disappointment
and
despair
the
very
magnitude
of
the
pain
braced
me
up
and
nerved
me
to
bear
the
dread
scrutiny
of
the
plotters
i
think
i
did
not
betray
myself
the
old
woman
was
watching
me
as
a
cat
does
a
mouse
she
had
her
right
hand
hidden
in
the
folds
of
her
gown
clutching
i
knew
that
long
cruel-looking
dagger
had
she
seen
any
disappointment
in
my
face
she
would
i
felt
have
known
that
the
moment
had
come
and
would
have
sprung
on
me
like
a
tigress
certain
of
taking
me
unprepared
i
looked
out
into
the
night
and
there
i
saw
new
cause
for
danger
before
and
around
the
hut
were
at
a
little
distance
some
shadowy
forms
they
were
quite
still
but
i
knew
that
they
were
all
alert
and
on
guard
small
chance
for
me
now
in
that
direction
again
i
stole
a
glance
round
the
place
in
moments
of
great
excitement
and
of
great
danger
which
is
excitement
the
mind
works
very
quickly
and
the
keenness
of
the
faculties
which
depend
on
the
mind
grows
in
proportion
i
now
felt
this
in
an
instant
i
took
in
the
whole
situation
i
saw
that
the
axe
had
been
taken
through
a
small
hole
made
in
one
of
the
rotten
boards
how
rotten
they
must
be
to
allow
of
such
a
thing
being
done
without
a
particle
of
noise
the
hut
was
a
regular
murder-trap
and
was
guarded
all
around
a
garroter
lay
on
the
roof
ready
to
entangle
me
with
his
noose
if
i
should
escape
the
dagger
of
the
old
hag
in
front
the
way
was
guarded
by
i
know
not
how
many
watchers
and
at
the
back
was
a
row
of
desperate
men--i
had
seen
their
eyes
still
through
the
crack
in
the
boards
of
the
floor
when
last
i
looked--as
they
lay
prone
waiting
for
the
signal
to
start
erect
if
it
was
to
be
ever
now
for
it
as
nonchalantly
as
i
could
i
turned
slightly
on
my
stool
so
as
to
get
my
right
leg
well
under
me
then
with
a
sudden
jump
turning
my
head
and
guarding
it
with
my
hands
and
with
the
fighting
instinct
of
the
knights
of
old
i
breathed
my
lady's
name
and
hurled
myself
against
the
back
wall
of
the
hut
watchful
as
they
were
the
suddenness
of
my
movement
surprised
both
pierre
and
the
old
woman
as
i
crashed
through
the
rotten
timbers
i
saw
the
old
woman
rise
with
a
leap
like
a
tiger
and
heard
her
low
gasp
of
baffled
rage
my
feet
lit
on
something
that
moved
and
as
i
jumped
away
i
knew
that
i
had
stepped
on
the
back
of
one
of
the
row
of
men
lying
on
their
faces
outside
the
hut
i
was
torn
with
nails
and
splinters
but
otherwise
unhurt
breathless
i
rushed
up
the
mound
in
front
of
me
hearing
as
i
went
the
dull
crash
of
the
shanty
as
it
collapsed
into
a
mass
it
was
a
nightmare
climb
the
mound
though
but
low
was
awfully
steep
and
with
each
step
i
took
the
mass
of
dust
and
cinders
tore
down
with
me
and
gave
way
under
my
feet
the
dust
rose
and
choked
me
it
was
sickening
foetid
awful
but
my
climb
was
i
felt
for
life
or
death
and
i
struggled
on
the
seconds
seemed
hours
but
the
few
moments
i
had
in
starting
combined
with
my
youth
and
strength
gave
me
a
great
advantage
and
though
several
forms
struggled
after
me
in
deadly
silence
which
was
more
dreadful
than
any
sound
i
easily
reached
the
top
since
then
i
have
climbed
the
cone
of
vesuvius
and
as
i
struggled
up
that
dreary
steep
amid
the
sulphurous
fumes
the
memory
of
that
awful
night
at
montrouge
came
back
to
me
so
vividly
that
i
almost
grew
faint
the
mound
was
one
of
the
tallest
in
the
region
of
dust
and
as
i
struggled
to
the
top
panting
for
breath
and
with
my
heart
beating
like
a
sledge-hammer
i
saw
away
to
my
left
the
dull
red
gleam
of
the
sky
and
nearer
still
the
flashing
of
lights
thank
god
i
knew
where
i
was
now
and
where
lay
the
road
to
paris
for
two
or
three
seconds
i
paused
and
looked
back
my
pursuers
were
still
well
behind
me
but
struggling
up
resolutely
and
in
deadly
silence
beyond
the
shanty
was
a
wreck--a
mass
of
timber
and
moving
forms
i
could
see
it
well
for
flames
were
already
bursting
out
the
rags
and
straw
had
evidently
caught
fire
from
the
lantern
still
silence
there
not
a
sound
these
old
wretches
could
die
game
anyhow
i
had
no
time
for
more
than
a
passing
glance
for
as
i
cast
an
eye
round
the
mound
preparatory
to
making
my
descent
i
saw
several
dark
forms
rushing
round
on
either
side
to
cut
me
off
on
my
way
it
was
now
a
race
for
life
they
were
trying
to
head
me
on
my
way
to
paris
and
with
the
instinct
of
the
moment
i
dashed
down
to
the
right-hand
side
i
was
just
in
time
for
though
i
came
as
it
seemed
to
me
down
the
steep
in
a
few
steps
the
wary
old
men
who
were
watching
me
turned
back
and
one
as
i
rushed
by
into
the
opening
between
the
two
mounds
in
front
almost
struck
me
a
blow
with
that
terrible
butcher's
axe
there
could
surely
not
be
two
such
weapons
about
then
began
a
really
horrible
chase
i
easily
ran
ahead
of
the
old
men
and
even
when
some
younger
ones
and
a
few
women
joined
in
the
hunt
i
easily
distanced
them
but
i
did
not
know
the
way
and
i
could
not
even
guide
myself
by
the
light
in
the
sky
for
i
was
running
away
from
it
i
had
heard
that
unless
of
conscious
purpose
hunted
men
turn
always
to
the
left
and
so
i
found
it
now
and
so
i
suppose
knew
also
my
pursuers
who
were
more
animals
than
men
and
with
cunning
or
instinct
had
found
out
such
secrets
for
themselves
for
on
finishing
a
quick
spurt
after
which
i
intended
to
take
a
moment's
breathing
space
i
suddenly
saw
ahead
of
me
two
or
three
forms
swiftly
passing
behind
a
mound
to
the
right
i
was
in
the
spider's
web
now
indeed
but
with
the
thought
of
this
new
danger
came
the
resource
of
the
hunted
and
so
i
darted
down
the
next
turning
to
the
right
i
continued
in
this
direction
for
some
hundred
yards
and
then
making
a
turn
to
the
left
again
felt
certain
that
i
had
at
any
rate
avoided
the
danger
of
being
surrounded
but
not
of
pursuit
for
on
came
the
rabble
after
me
steady
dogged
relentless
and
still
in
grim
silence
in
the
greater
darkness
the
mounds
seemed
now
to
be
somewhat
smaller
than
before
although--for
the
night
was
closing--they
looked
bigger
in
proportion
i
was
now
well
ahead
of
my
pursuers
so
i
made
a
dart
up
the
mound
in
front
oh
joy
of
joys
i
was
close
to
the
edge
of
this
inferno
of
dustheaps
away
behind
me
the
red
light
of
paris
was
in
the
sky
and
towering
up
behind
rose
the
heights
of
montmarte--a
dim
light
with
here
and
there
brilliant
points
like
stars
restored
to
vigour
in
a
moment
i
ran
over
the
few
remaining
mounds
of
decreasing
size
and
found
myself
on
the
level
land
beyond
even
then
however
the
prospect
was
not
inviting
all
before
me
was
dark
and
dismal
and
i
had
evidently
come
on
one
of
those
dank
low-lying
waste
places
which
are
found
here
and
there
in
the
neighbourhood
of
great
cities
places
of
waste
and
desolation
where
the
space
is
required
for
the
ultimate
agglomeration
of
all
that
is
noxious
and
the
ground
is
so
poor
as
to
create
no
desire
of
occupancy
even
in
the
lowest
squatter
with
eyes
accustomed
to
the
gloom
of
the
evening
and
away
now
from
the
shadows
of
those
dreadful
dustheaps
i
could
see
much
more
easily
than
i
could
a
little
while
ago
it
might
have
been
of
course
that
the
glare
in
the
sky
of
the
lights
of
paris
though
the
city
was
some
miles
away
was
reflected
here
howsoever
it
was
i
saw
well
enough
to
take
bearings
for
certainly
some
little
distance
around
me
in
front
was
a
bleak
flat
waste
that
seemed
almost
dead
level
with
here
and
there
the
dark
shimmering
of
stagnant
pools
seemingly
far
off
on
the
right
amid
a
small
cluster
of
scattered
lights
rose
a
dark
mass
of
fort
montrouge
and
away
to
the
left
in
the
dim
distance
pointed
with
stray
gleams
from
cottage
windows
the
lights
in
the
sky
showed
the
locality
of
bicãªtre
a
moment's
thought
decided
me
to
take
to
the
right
and
try
to
reach
montrouge
there
at
least
would
be
some
sort
of
safety
and
i
might
possibly
long
before
come
on
some
of
the
cross
roads
which
i
knew
somewhere
not
far
off
must
lie
the
strategic
road
made
to
connect
the
outlying
chain
of
forts
circling
the
city
then
i
looked
back
coming
over
the
mounds
and
outlined
black
against
the
glare
of
the
parisian
horizon
i
saw
several
moving
figures
and
still
a
way
to
the
right
several
more
deploying
out
between
me
and
my
destination
they
evidently
meant
to
cut
me
off
in
this
direction
and
so
my
choice
became
constricted
it
lay
now
between
going
straight
ahead
or
turning
to
the
left
stooping
to
the
ground
so
as
to
get
the
advantage
of
the
horizon
as
a
line
of
sight
i
looked
carefully
in
this
direction
but
could
detect
no
sign
of
my
enemies
i
argued
that
as
they
had
not
guarded
or
were
not
trying
to
guard
that
point
there
was
evidently
danger
to
me
there
already
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
straight
on
before
me
it
was
not
an
inviting
prospect
and
as
i
went
on
the
reality
grew
worse
the
ground
became
soft
and
oozy
and
now
and
again
gave
way
beneath
me
in
a
sickening
kind
of
way
i
seemed
somehow
to
be
going
down
for
i
saw
round
me
places
seemingly
more
elevated
than
where
i
was
and
this
in
a
place
which
from
a
little
way
back
seemed
dead
level
i
looked
around
but
could
see
none
of
my
pursuers
this
was
strange
for
all
along
these
birds
of
the
night
had
followed
me
through
the
darkness
as
well
as
though
it
was
broad
daylight
how
i
blamed
myself
for
coming
out
in
my
light-coloured
tourist
suit
of
tweed
the
silence
and
my
not
being
able
to
see
my
enemies
whilst
i
felt
that
they
were
watching
me
grew
appalling
and
in
the
hope
of
some
one
not
of
this
ghastly
crew
hearing
me
i
raised
my
voice
and
shouted
several
times
there
was
not
the
slightest
response
not
even
an
echo
rewarded
my
efforts
for
a
while
i
stood
stock
still
and
kept
my
eyes
in
one
direction
on
one
of
the
rising
places
around
me
i
saw
something
dark
move
along
then
another
and
another
this
was
to
my
left
and
seemingly
moving
to
head
me
off
i
thought
that
again
i
might
with
my
skill
as
a
runner
elude
my
enemies
at
this
game
and
so
with
all
my
speed
darted
forward
splash
my
feet
had
given
way
in
a
mass
of
slimy
rubbish
and
i
had
fallen
headlong
into
a
reeking
stagnant
pool
the
water
and
the
mud
in
which
my
arms
sank
up
to
the
elbows
was
filthy
and
nauseous
beyond
description
and
in
the
suddenness
of
my
fall
i
had
actually
swallowed
some
of
the
filthy
stuff
which
nearly
choked
me
and
made
me
gasp
for
breath
never
shall
i
forget
the
moments
during
which
i
stood
trying
to
recover
myself
almost
fainting
from
the
foetid
odour
of
the
filthy
pool
whose
white
mist
rose
ghostlike
around
worst
of
all
with
the
acute
despair
of
the
hunted
animal
when
he
sees
the
pursuing
pack
closing
on
him
i
saw
before
my
eyes
whilst
i
stood
helpless
the
dark
forms
of
my
pursuers
moving
swiftly
to
surround
me
it
is
curious
how
our
minds
work
on
odd
matters
even
when
the
energies
of
thought
are
seemingly
concentrated
on
some
terrible
and
pressing
need
i
was
in
momentary
peril
of
my
life
my
safety
depended
on
my
action
and
my
choice
of
alternatives
coming
now
with
almost
every
step
i
took
and
yet
i
could
not
but
think
of
the
strange
dogged
persistency
of
these
old
men
their
silent
resolution
their
steadfast
grim
persistency
even
in
such
a
cause
commanded
as
well
as
fear
even
a
measure
of
respect
what
must
they
have
been
in
the
vigour
of
their
youth
i
could
understand
now
that
whirlwind
rush
on
the
bridge
of
arcola
that
scornful
exclamation
of
the
old
guard
at
waterloo
unconscious
cerebration
has
its
own
pleasures
even
at
such
moments
but
fortunately
it
does
not
in
any
way
clash
with
the
thought
from
which
action
springs
i
realised
at
a
glance
that
so
far
i
was
defeated
in
my
object
my
enemies
as
yet
had
won
they
had
succeeded
in
surrounding
me
on
three
sides
and
were
bent
on
driving
me
off
to
the
left-hand
where
there
was
already
some
danger
for
me
for
they
had
left
no
guard
i
accepted
the
alternative--it
was
a
case
of
hobson's
choice
and
run
i
had
to
keep
the
lower
ground
for
my
pursuers
were
on
the
higher
places
however
though
the
ooze
and
broken
ground
impeded
me
my
youth
and
training
made
me
able
to
hold
my
ground
and
by
keeping
a
diagonal
line
i
not
only
kept
them
from
gaining
on
me
but
even
began
to
distance
them
this
gave
me
new
heart
and
strength
and
by
this
time
habitual
training
was
beginning
to
tell
and
my
second
wind
had
come
before
me
the
ground
rose
slightly
i
rushed
up
the
slope
and
found
before
me
a
waste
of
watery
slime
with
a
low
dyke
or
bank
looking
black
and
grim
beyond
i
felt
that
if
i
could
but
reach
that
dyke
in
safety
i
could
there
with
solid
ground
under
my
feet
and
some
kind
of
path
to
guide
me
find
with
comparative
ease
a
way
out
of
my
troubles
after
a
glance
right
and
left
and
seeing
no
one
near
i
kept
my
eyes
for
a
few
minutes
to
their
rightful
work
of
aiding
my
feet
whilst
i
crossed
the
swamp
it
was
rough
hard
work
but
there
was
little
danger
merely
toil
and
a
short
time
took
me
to
the
dyke
i
rushed
up
the
slope
exulting
but
here
again
i
met
a
new
shock
on
either
side
of
me
rose
a
number
of
crouching
figures
from
right
and
left
they
rushed
at
me
each
body
held
a
rope
the
cordon
was
nearly
complete
i
could
pass
on
neither
side
and
the
end
was
near
there
was
only
one
chance
and
i
took
it
i
hurled
myself
across
the
dyke
and
escaping
out
of
the
very
clutches
of
my
foes
threw
myself
into
the
stream
at
any
other
time
i
should
have
thought
that
water
foul
and
filthy
but
now
it
was
as
welcome
as
the
most
crystal
stream
to
the
parched
traveller
it
was
a
highway
of
safety
my
pursuers
rushed
after
me
had
only
one
of
them
held
the
rope
it
would
have
been
all
up
with
me
for
he
could
have
entangled
me
before
i
had
time
to
swim
a
stroke
but
the
many
hands
holding
it
embarrassed
and
delayed
them
and
when
the
rope
struck
the
water
i
heard
the
splash
well
behind
me
a
few
minutes'
hard
swimming
took
me
across
the
stream
refreshed
with
the
immersion
and
encouraged
by
the
escape
i
climbed
the
dyke
in
comparative
gaiety
of
spirits
from
the
top
i
looked
back
through
the
darkness
i
saw
my
assailants
scattering
up
and
down
along
the
dyke
the
pursuit
was
evidently
not
ended
and
again
i
had
to
choose
my
course
beyond
the
dyke
where
i
stood
was
a
wild
swampy
space
very
similar
to
that
which
i
had
crossed
i
determined
to
shun
such
a
place
and
thought
for
a
moment
whether
i
would
take
up
or
down
the
dyke
i
thought
i
heard
a
sound--the
muffled
sound
of
oars
so
i
listened
and
then
shouted
no
response
but
the
sound
ceased
my
enemies
had
evidently
got
a
boat
of
some
kind
as
they
were
on
the
up
side
of
me
i
took
the
down
path
and
began
to
run
as
i
passed
to
the
left
of
where
i
had
entered
the
water
i
heard
several
splashes
soft
and
stealthy
like
the
sound
a
rat
makes
as
he
plunges
into
the
stream
but
vastly
greater
and
as
i
looked
i
saw
the
dark
sheen
of
the
water
broken
by
the
ripples
of
several
advancing
heads
some
of
my
enemies
were
swimming
the
stream
also
and
now
behind
me
up
the
stream
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
quick
rattle
and
creak
of
oars
my
enemies
were
in
hot
pursuit
i
put
my
best
leg
foremost
and
ran
on
after
a
break
of
a
couple
of
minutes
i
looked
back
and
by
a
gleam
of
light
through
the
ragged
clouds
i
saw
several
dark
forms
climbing
the
bank
behind
me
the
wind
had
now
begun
to
rise
and
the
water
beside
me
was
ruffled
and
beginning
to
break
in
tiny
waves
on
the
bank
i
had
to
keep
my
eyes
pretty
well
on
the
ground
before
me
lest
i
should
stumble
for
i
knew
that
to
stumble
was
death
after
a
few
minutes
i
looked
back
behind
me
on
the
dyke
were
only
a
few
dark
figures
but
crossing
the
waste
swampy
ground
were
many
more
what
new
danger
this
portended
i
did
not
know--could
only
guess
then
as
i
ran
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
track
kept
ever
sloping
away
to
the
right
i
looked
up
ahead
and
saw
that
the
river
was
much
wider
than
before
and
that
the
dyke
on
which
i
stood
fell
quite
away
and
beyond
it
was
another
stream
on
whose
near
bank
i
saw
some
of
the
dark
forms
now
across
the
marsh
i
was
on
an
island
of
some
kind
my
situation
was
now
indeed
terrible
for
my
enemies
had
hemmed
me
in
on
every
side
behind
came
the
quickening
roll
of
the
oars
as
though
my
pursuers
knew
that
the
end
was
close
around
me
on
every
side
was
desolation
there
was
not
a
roof
or
light
as
far
as
i
could
see
far
off
to
the
right
rose
some
dark
mass
but
what
it
was
i
knew
not
for
a
moment
i
paused
to
think
what
i
should
do
not
for
more
for
my
pursuers
were
drawing
closer
then
my
mind
was
made
up
i
slipped
down
the
bank
and
took
to
the
water
i
struck
out
straight
ahead
so
as
to
gain
the
current
by
clearing
the
backwater
of
the
island
for
such
i
presume
it
was
when
i
had
passed
into
the
stream
i
waited
till
a
cloud
came
driving
across
the
moon
and
leaving
all
in
darkness
then
i
took
off
my
hat
and
laid
it
softly
on
the
water
floating
with
the
stream
and
a
second
after
dived
to
the
right
and
struck
out
under
water
with
all
my
might
i
was
i
suppose
half
a
minute
under
water
and
when
i
rose
came
up
as
softly
as
i
could
and
turning
looked
back
there
went
my
light
brown
hat
floating
merrily
away
close
behind
it
came
a
rickety
old
boat
driven
furiously
by
a
pair
of
oars
the
moon
was
still
partly
obscured
by
the
drifting
clouds
but
in
the
partial
light
i
could
see
a
man
in
the
bows
holding
aloft
ready
to
strike
what
appeared
to
me
to
be
that
same
dreadful
pole-axe
which
i
had
before
escaped
as
i
looked
the
boat
drew
closer
closer
and
the
man
struck
savagely
the
hat
disappeared
the
man
fell
forward
almost
out
of
the
boat
his
comrades
dragged
him
in
but
without
the
axe
and
then
as
i
turned
with
all
my
energies
bent
on
reaching
the
further
bank
i
heard
the
fierce
whirr
of
the
muttered
'sacre'
which
marked
the
anger
of
my
baffled
pursuers
that
was
the
first
sound
i
had
heard
from
human
lips
during
all
this
dreadful
chase
and
full
as
it
was
of
menace
and
danger
to
me
it
was
a
welcome
sound
for
it
broke
that
awful
silence
which
shrouded
and
appalled
me
it
was
as
though
an
overt
sign
that
my
opponents
were
men
and
not
ghosts
and
that
with
them
i
had
at
least
the
chance
of
a
man
though
but
one
against
many
but
now
that
the
spell
of
silence
was
broken
the
sounds
came
thick
and
fast
from
boat
to
shore
and
back
from
shore
to
boat
came
quick
question
and
answer
all
in
the
fiercest
whispers
i
looked
back--a
fatal
thing
to
do--for
in
the
instant
someone
caught
sight
of
my
face
which
showed
white
on
the
dark
water
and
shouted
hands
pointed
to
me
and
in
a
moment
or
two
the
boat
was
under
weigh
and
following
hard
after
me
i
had
but
a
little
way
to
go
but
quicker
and
quicker
came
the
boat
after
me
a
few
more
strokes
and
i
would
be
on
the
shore
but
i
felt
the
oncoming
of
the
boat
and
expected
each
second
to
feel
the
crash
of
an
oar
or
other
weapon
on
my
head
had
i
not
seen
that
dreadful
axe
disappear
in
the
water
i
do
not
think
that
i
could
have
won
the
shore
i
heard
the
muttered
curses
of
those
not
rowing
and
the
laboured
breath
of
the
rowers
with
one
supreme
effort
for
life
or
liberty
i
touched
the
bank
and
sprang
up
it
there
was
not
a
single
second
to
spare
for
hard
behind
me
the
boat
grounded
and
several
dark
forms
sprang
after
me
i
gained
the
top
of
the
dyke
and
keeping
to
the
left
ran
on
again
the
boat
put
off
and
followed
down
the
stream
seeing
this
i
feared
danger
in
this
direction
and
quickly
turning
ran
down
the
dyke
on
the
other
side
and
after
passing
a
short
stretch
of
marshy
ground
gained
a
wild
open
flat
country
and
sped
on
still
behind
me
came
on
my
relentless
pursuers
far
away
below
me
i
saw
the
same
dark
mass
as
before
but
now
grown
closer
and
greater
my
heart
gave
a
great
thrill
of
delight
for
i
knew
that
it
must
be
the
fortress
of
bicãªtre
and
with
new
courage
i
ran
on
i
had
heard
that
between
each
and
all
of
the
protecting
forts
of
paris
there
are
strategic
ways
deep
sunk
roads
where
soldiers
marching
should
be
sheltered
from
an
enemy
i
knew
that
if
i
could
gain
this
road
i
would
be
safe
but
in
the
darkness
i
could
not
see
any
sign
of
it
so
in
blind
hope
of
striking
it
i
ran
on
presently
i
came
to
the
edge
of
a
deep
cut
and
found
that
down
below
me
ran
a
road
guarded
on
each
side
by
a
ditch
of
water
fenced
on
either
side
by
a
straight
high
wall
getting
fainter
and
dizzier
i
ran
on
the
ground
got
more
broken--more
and
more
still
till
i
staggered
and
fell
and
rose
again
and
ran
on
in
the
blind
anguish
of
the
hunted
again
the
thought
of
alice
nerved
me
i
would
not
be
lost
and
wreck
her
life
i
would
fight
and
struggle
for
life
to
the
bitter
end
with
a
great
effort
i
caught
the
top
of
the
wall
as
scrambling
like
a
catamount
i
drew
myself
up
i
actually
felt
a
hand
touch
the
sole
of
my
foot
i
was
now
on
a
sort
of
causeway
and
before
me
i
saw
a
dim
light
blind
and
dizzy
i
ran
on
staggered
and
fell
rising
covered
with
dust
and
blood
'halt
la'
the
words
sounded
like
a
voice
from
heaven
a
blaze
of
light
seemed
to
enwrap
me
and
i
shouted
with
joy
'qui
va
la'
the
rattle
of
musketry
the
flash
of
steel
before
my
eyes
instinctively
i
stopped
though
close
behind
me
came
a
rush
of
my
pursuers
another
word
or
two
and
out
from
a
gateway
poured
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
tide
of
red
and
blue
as
the
guard
turned
out
all
around
seemed
blazing
with
light
and
the
flash
of
steel
the
clink
and
rattle
of
arms
and
the
loud
harsh
voices
of
command
as
i
fell
forward
utterly
exhausted
a
soldier
caught
me
i
looked
back
in
dreadful
expectation
and
saw
the
mass
of
dark
forms
disappearing
into
the
night
then
i
must
have
fainted
when
i
recovered
my
senses
i
was
in
the
guard
room
they
gave
me
brandy
and
after
a
while
i
was
able
to
tell
them
something
of
what
had
passed
then
a
commissary
of
police
appeared
apparently
out
of
the
empty
air
as
is
the
way
of
the
parisian
police
officer
he
listened
attentively
and
then
had
a
moment's
consultation
with
the
officer
in
command
apparently
they
were
agreed
for
they
asked
me
if
i
were
ready
now
to
come
with
them
'where
to'
i
asked
rising
to
go
'back
to
the
dust
heaps
we
shall
perhaps
catch
them
yet'
'i
shall
try'
said
i
he
eyed
me
for
a
moment
keenly
and
said
suddenly
'would
you
like
to
wait
a
while
or
till
tomorrow
young
englishman'
this
touched
me
to
the
quick
as
perhaps
he
intended
and
i
jumped
to
my
feet
'come
now'
i
said
'now
now
an
englishman
is
always
ready
for
his
duty'
the
commissary
was
a
good
fellow
as
well
as
a
shrewd
one
he
slapped
my
shoulder
kindly
'brave
garã§on'
he
said
'forgive
me
but
i
knew
what
would
do
you
most
good
the
guard
is
ready
come'
and
so
passing
right
through
the
guard
room
and
through
a
long
vaulted
passage
we
were
out
into
the
night
a
few
of
the
men
in
front
had
powerful
lanterns
through
courtyards
and
down
a
sloping
way
we
passed
out
through
a
low
archway
to
a
sunken
road
the
same
that
i
had
seen
in
my
flight
the
order
was
given
to
get
at
the
double
and
with
a
quick
springing
stride
half
run
half
walk
the
soldiers
went
swiftly
along
i
felt
my
strength
renewed
again--such
is
the
difference
between
hunter
and
hunted
a
very
short
distance
took
us
to
a
low-lying
pontoon
bridge
across
the
stream
and
evidently
very
little
higher
up
than
i
had
struck
it
some
effort
had
evidently
been
made
to
damage
it
for
the
ropes
had
all
been
cut
and
one
of
the
chains
had
been
broken
i
heard
the
officer
say
to
the
commissary
'we
are
just
in
time
a
few
more
minutes
and
they
would
have
destroyed
the
bridge
forward
quicker
still'
and
on
we
went
again
we
reached
a
pontoon
on
the
winding
stream
as
we
came
up
we
heard
the
hollow
boom
of
the
metal
drums
as
the
efforts
to
destroy
the
bridge
was
again
renewed
a
word
of
command
was
given
and
several
men
raised
their
rifles
'fire'
a
volley
rang
out
there
was
a
muffled
cry
and
the
dark
forms
dispersed
but
the
evil
was
done
and
we
saw
the
far
end
of
the
pontoon
swing
into
the
stream
this
was
a
serious
delay
and
it
was
nearly
an
hour
before
we
had
renewed
ropes
and
restored
the
bridge
sufficiently
to
allow
us
to
cross
we
renewed
the
chase
quicker
quicker
we
went
towards
the
dust
heaps
after
a
time
we
came
to
a
place
that
i
knew
there
were
the
remains
of
a
fire--a
few
smouldering
wood
ashes
still
cast
a
red
glow
but
the
bulk
of
the
ashes
were
cold
i
knew
the
site
of
the
hut
and
the
hill
behind
it
up
which
i
had
rushed
and
in
the
flickering
glow
the
eyes
of
the
rats
still
shone
with
a
sort
of
phosphorescence
the
commissary
spoke
a
word
to
the
officer
and
he
cried
'halt'
the
soldiers
were
ordered
to
spread
around
and
watch
and
then
we
commenced
to
examine
the
ruins
the
commissary
himself
began
to
lift
away
the
charred
boards
and
rubbish
these
the
soldiers
took
and
piled
together
presently
he
started
back
then
bent
down
and
rising
beckoned
me
'see'
he
said
it
was
a
gruesome
sight
there
lay
a
skeleton
face
downwards
a
woman
by
the
lines--an
old
woman
by
the
coarse
fibre
of
the
bone
between
the
ribs
rose
a
long
spike-like
dagger
made
from
a
butcher's
sharpening
knife
its
keen
point
buried
in
the
spine
'you
will
observe'
said
the
commissary
to
the
officer
and
to
me
as
he
took
out
his
note
book
'that
the
woman
must
have
fallen
on
her
dagger
the
rats
are
many
here--see
their
eyes
glistening
among
that
heap
of
bones--and
you
will
also
notice'--i
shuddered
as
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
skeleton--'that
but
little
time
was
lost
by
them
for
the
bones
are
scarcely
cold'
there
was
no
other
sign
of
any
one
near
living
or
dead
and
so
deploying
again
into
line
the
soldiers
passed
on
presently
we
came
to
the
hut
made
of
the
old
wardrobe
we
approached
in
five
of
the
six
compartments
was
an
old
man
sleeping--sleeping
so
soundly
that
even
the
glare
of
the
lanterns
did
not
wake
them
old
and
grim
and
grizzled
they
looked
with
their
gaunt
wrinkled
bronzed
faces
and
their
white
moustaches
the
officer
called
out
harshly
and
loudly
a
word
of
command
and
in
an
instant
each
one
of
them
was
on
his
feet
before
us
and
standing
at
'attention'
'what
do
you
here'
'we
sleep'
was
the
answer
'where
are
the
other
chiffoniers'
asked
the
commissary
'gone
to
work'
'and
you'
'we
are
on
guard'
'peste'
laughed
the
officer
grimly
as
he
looked
at
the
old
men
one
after
the
other
in
the
face
and
added
with
cool
deliberate
cruelty
'asleep
on
duty
is
this
the
manner
of
the
old
guard
no
wonder
then
a
waterloo'
by
the
gleam
of
the
lantern
i
saw
the
grim
old
faces
grow
deadly
pale
and
almost
shuddered
at
the
look
in
the
eyes
of
the
old
men
as
the
laugh
of
the
soldiers
echoed
the
grim
pleasantry
of
the
officer
i
felt
in
that
moment
that
i
was
in
some
measure
avenged
for
a
moment
they
looked
as
if
they
would
throw
themselves
on
the
taunter
but
years
of
their
life
had
schooled
them
and
they
remained
still
'you
are
but
five'
said
the
commissary
'where
is
the
sixth'
the
answer
came
with
a
grim
chuckle
'he
is
there'
and
the
speaker
pointed
to
the
bottom
of
the
wardrobe
'he
died
last
night
you
won't
find
much
of
him
the
burial
of
the
rats
is
quick'
the
commissary
stooped
and
looked
in
then
he
turned
to
the
officer
and
said
calmly
'we
may
as
well
go
back
no
trace
here
now
nothing
to
prove
that
man
was
the
one
wounded
by
your
soldiers'
bullets
probably
they
murdered
him
to
cover
up
the
trace
see'
again
he
stooped
and
placed
his
hands
on
the
skeleton
'the
rats
work
quickly
and
they
are
many
these
bones
are
warm'
i
shuddered
and
so
did
many
more
of
those
around
me
'form'
said
the
officer
and
so
in
marching
order
with
the
lanterns
swinging
in
front
and
the
manacled
veterans
in
the
midst
with
steady
tramp
we
took
ourselves
out
of
the
dustheaps
and
turned
backward
to
the
fortress
of
bicãªtre





my
year
of
probation
has
long
since
ended
and
alice
is
my
wife
but
when
i
look
back
upon
that
trying
twelvemonth
one
of
the
most
vivid
incidents
that
memory
recalls
is
that
associated
with
my
visit
to
the
city
of
dust
a
dream
of
red
hands
the
first
opinion
given
to
me
regarding
jacob
settle
was
a
simple
descriptive
statement
'he's
a
down-in-the-mouth
chap'
but
i
found
that
it
embodied
the
thoughts
and
ideas
of
all
his
fellow-workmen
there
was
in
the
phrase
a
certain
easy
tolerance
an
absence
of
positive
feeling
of
any
kind
rather
than
any
complete
opinion
which
marked
pretty
accurately
the
man's
place
in
public
esteem
still
there
was
some
dissimilarity
between
this
and
his
appearance
which
unconsciously
set
me
thinking
and
by
degrees
as
i
saw
more
of
the
place
and
the
workmen
i
came
to
have
a
special
interest
in
him
he
was
i
found
for
ever
doing
kindnesses
not
involving
money
expenses
beyond
his
humble
means
but
in
the
manifold
ways
of
forethought
and
forbearance
and
self-repression
which
are
of
the
truer
charities
of
life
women
and
children
trusted
him
implicitly
though
strangely
enough
he
rather
shunned
them
except
when
anyone
was
sick
and
then
he
made
his
appearance
to
help
if
he
could
timidly
and
awkwardly
he
led
a
very
solitary
life
keeping
house
by
himself
in
a
tiny
cottage
or
rather
hut
of
one
room
far
on
the
edge
of
the
moorland
his
existence
seemed
so
sad
and
solitary
that
i
wished
to
cheer
it
up
and
for
the
purpose
took
the
occasion
when
we
had
both
been
sitting
up
with
a
child
injured
by
me
through
accident
to
offer
to
lend
him
books
he
gladly
accepted
and
as
we
parted
in
the
grey
of
the
dawn
i
felt
that
something
of
mutual
confidence
had
been
established
between
us
the
books
were
always
most
carefully
and
punctually
returned
and
in
time
jacob
settle
and
i
became
quite
friends
once
or
twice
as
i
crossed
the
moorland
on
sundays
i
looked
in
on
him
but
on
such
occasions
he
was
shy
and
ill
at
ease
so
that
i
felt
diffident
about
calling
to
see
him
he
would
never
under
any
circumstances
come
into
my
own
lodgings
one
sunday
afternoon
i
was
coming
back
from
a
long
walk
beyond
the
moor
and
as
i
passed
settle's
cottage
stopped
at
the
door
to
say
'how
do
you
do'
to
him
as
the
door
was
shut
i
thought
that
he
was
out
and
merely
knocked
for
form's
sake
or
through
habit
not
expecting
to
get
any
answer
to
my
surprise
i
heard
a
feeble
voice
from
within
though
what
was
said
i
could
not
hear
i
entered
at
once
and
found
jacob
lying
half-dressed
upon
his
bed
he
was
as
pale
as
death
and
the
sweat
was
simply
rolling
off
his
face
his
hands
were
unconsciously
gripping
the
bedclothes
as
a
drowning
man
holds
on
to
whatever
he
may
grasp
as
i
came
in
he
half
arose
with
a
wild
hunted
look
in
his
eyes
which
were
wide
open
and
staring
as
though
something
of
horror
had
come
before
him
but
when
he
recognised
me
he
sank
back
on
the
couch
with
a
smothered
sob
of
relief
and
closed
his
eyes
i
stood
by
him
for
a
while
quite
a
minute
or
two
while
he
gasped
then
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
but
with
such
a
despairing
woeful
expression
that
as
i
am
a
living
man
i
would
have
rather
seen
that
frozen
look
of
horror
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
asked
after
his
health
for
a
while
he
would
not
answer
me
except
to
say
that
he
was
not
ill
but
then
after
scrutinising
me
closely
he
half
arose
on
his
elbow
and
said
'i
thank
you
kindly
sir
but
i'm
simply
telling
you
the
truth
i
am
not
ill
as
men
call
it
though
god
knows
whether
there
be
not
worse
sicknesses
than
doctors
know
of
i'll
tell
you
as
you
are
so
kind
but
i
trust
that
you
won't
even
mention
such
a
thing
to
a
living
soul
for
it
might
work
me
more
and
greater
woe
i
am
suffering
from
a
bad
dream'
'a
bad
dream'
i
said
hoping
to
cheer
him
'but
dreams
pass
away
with
the
light--even
with
waking'
there
i
stopped
for
before
he
spoke
i
saw
the
answer
in
his
desolate
look
round
the
little
place
'no
no
that's
all
well
for
people
that
live
in
comfort
and
with
those
they
love
around
them
it
is
a
thousand
times
worse
for
those
who
live
alone
and
have
to
do
so
what
cheer
is
there
for
me
waking
here
in
the
silence
of
the
night
with
the
wide
moor
around
me
full
of
voices
and
full
of
faces
that
make
my
waking
a
worse
dream
than
my
sleep
ah
young
sir
you
have
no
past
that
can
send
its
legions
to
people
the
darkness
and
the
empty
space
and
i
pray
the
good
god
that
you
may
never
have'
as
he
spoke
there
was
such
an
almost
irresistible
gravity
of
conviction
in
his
manner
that
i
abandoned
my
remonstrance
about
his
solitary
life
i
felt
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
some
secret
influence
which
i
could
not
fathom
to
my
relief
for
i
knew
not
what
to
say
he
went
on
'two
nights
past
have
i
dreamed
it
it
was
hard
enough
the
first
night
but
i
came
through
it
last
night
the
expectation
was
in
itself
almost
worse
than
the
dream--until
the
dream
came
and
then
it
swept
away
every
remembrance
of
lesser
pain
i
stayed
awake
till
just
before
the
dawn
and
then
it
came
again
and
ever
since
i
have
been
in
such
an
agony
as
i
am
sure
the
dying
feel
and
with
it
all
the
dread
of
tonight'
before
he
had
got
to
the
end
of
the
sentence
my
mind
was
made
up
and
i
felt
that
i
could
speak
to
him
more
cheerfully
'try
and
get
to
sleep
early
tonight--in
fact
before
the
evening
has
passed
away
the
sleep
will
refresh
you
and
i
promise
you
there
will
not
be
any
bad
dreams
after
tonight'
he
shook
his
head
hopelessly
so
i
sat
a
little
longer
and
then
left
him
when
i
got
home
i
made
my
arrangements
for
the
night
for
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
share
jacob
settle's
lonely
vigil
in
his
cottage
on
the
moor
i
judged
that
if
he
got
to
sleep
before
sunset
he
would
wake
well
before
midnight
and
so
just
as
the
bells
of
the
city
were
striking
eleven
i
stood
opposite
his
door
armed
with
a
bag
in
which
were
my
supper
an
extra
large
flask
a
couple
of
candles
and
a
book
the
moonlight
was
bright
and
flooded
the
whole
moor
till
it
was
almost
as
light
as
day
but
ever
and
anon
black
clouds
drove
across
the
sky
and
made
a
darkness
which
by
comparison
seemed
almost
tangible
i
opened
the
door
softly
and
entered
without
waking
jacob
who
lay
asleep
with
his
white
face
upward
he
was
still
and
again
bathed
in
sweat
i
tried
to
imagine
what
visions
were
passing
before
those
closed
eyes
which
could
bring
with
them
the
misery
and
woe
which
were
stamped
on
the
face
but
fancy
failed
me
and
i
waited
for
the
awakening
it
came
suddenly
and
in
a
fashion
which
touched
me
to
the
quick
for
the
hollow
groan
that
broke
from
the
man's
white
lips
as
he
half
arose
and
sank
back
was
manifestly
the
realisation
or
completion
of
some
train
of
thought
which
had
gone
before
'if
this
be
dreaming'
said
i
to
myself
'then
it
must
be
based
on
some
very
terrible
reality
what
can
have
been
that
unhappy
fact
that
he
spoke
of'
while
i
thus
spoke
he
realised
that
i
was
with
him
it
struck
me
as
strange
that
he
had
no
period
of
that
doubt
as
to
whether
dream
or
reality
surrounded
him
which
commonly
marks
an
expected
environment
of
waking
men
with
a
positive
cry
of
joy
he
seized
my
hand
and
held
it
in
his
two
wet
trembling
hands
as
a
frightened
child
clings
on
to
someone
whom
it
loves
i
tried
to
soothe
him
'there
there
it
is
all
right
i
have
come
to
stay
with
you
tonight
and
together
we
will
try
to
fight
this
evil
dream'
he
let
go
my
hand
suddenly
and
sank
back
on
his
bed
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
'fight
it--the
evil
dream
ah
no
sir
no
no
mortal
power
can
fight
that
dream
for
it
comes
from
god--and
is
burned
in
here'
and
he
beat
upon
his
forehead
then
he
went
on
'it
is
the
same
dream
ever
the
same
and
yet
it
grows
in
its
power
to
torture
me
every
time
it
comes'
'what
is
the
dream'
i
asked
thinking
that
the
speaking
of
it
might
give
him
some
relief
but
he
shrank
away
from
me
and
after
a
long
pause
said
'no
i
had
better
not
tell
it
it
may
not
come
again'
there
was
manifestly
something
to
conceal
from
me--something
that
lay
behind
the
dream
so
i
answered
'all
right
i
hope
you
have
seen
the
last
of
it
but
if
it
should
come
again
you
will
tell
me
will
you
not
i
ask
not
out
of
curiosity
but
because
i
think
it
may
relieve
you
to
speak'
he
answered
with
what
i
thought
was
almost
an
undue
amount
of
solemnity
'if
it
comes
again
i
shall
tell
you
all'
then
i
tried
to
get
his
mind
away
from
the
subject
to
more
mundane
things
so
i
produced
supper
and
made
him
share
it
with
me
including
the
contents
of
the
flask
after
a
little
he
braced
up
and
when
i
lit
my
cigar
having
given
him
another
we
smoked
a
full
hour
and
talked
of
many
things
little
by
little
the
comfort
of
his
body
stole
over
his
mind
and
i
could
see
sleep
laying
her
gentle
hands
on
his
eyelids
he
felt
it
too
and
told
me
that
now
he
felt
all
right
and
i
might
safely
leave
him
but
i
told
him
that
right
or
wrong
i
was
going
to
see
in
the
daylight
so
i
lit
my
other
candle
and
began
to
read
as
he
fell
asleep
by
degrees
i
got
interested
in
my
book
so
interested
that
presently
i
was
startled
by
its
dropping
out
of
my
hands
i
looked
and
saw
that
jacob
was
still
asleep
and
i
was
rejoiced
to
see
that
there
was
on
his
face
a
look
of
unwonted
happiness
while
his
lips
seemed
to
move
with
unspoken
words
then
i
turned
to
my
work
again
and
again
woke
but
this
time
to
feel
chilled
to
my
very
marrow
by
hearing
the
voice
from
the
bed
beside
me
'not
with
those
red
hands
never
never'
on
looking
at
him
i
found
that
he
was
still
asleep
he
woke
however
in
an
instant
and
did
not
seem
surprised
to
see
me
there
was
again
that
strange
apathy
as
to
his
surroundings
then
i
said
'settle
tell
me
your
dream
you
may
speak
freely
for
i
shall
hold
your
confidence
sacred
while
we
both
live
i
shall
never
mention
what
you
may
choose
to
tell
me'
he
replied
'i
said
i
would
but
i
had
better
tell
you
first
what
goes
before
the
dream
that
you
may
understand
i
was
a
schoolmaster
when
i
was
a
very
young
man
it
was
only
a
parish
school
in
a
little
village
in
the
west
country
no
need
to
mention
any
names
better
not
i
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
young
girl
whom
i
loved
and
almost
reverenced
it
was
the
old
story
while
we
were
waiting
for
the
time
when
we
could
afford
to
set
up
house
together
another
man
came
along
he
was
nearly
as
young
as
i
was
and
handsome
and
a
gentleman
with
all
a
gentleman's
attractive
ways
for
a
woman
of
our
class
he
would
go
fishing
and
she
would
meet
him
while
i
was
at
my
work
in
school
i
reasoned
with
her
and
implored
her
to
give
him
up
i
offered
to
get
married
at
once
and
go
away
and
begin
the
world
in
a
strange
country
but
she
would
not
listen
to
anything
i
could
say
and
i
could
see
that
she
was
infatuated
with
him
then
i
took
it
on
myself
to
meet
the
man
and
ask
him
to
deal
well
with
the
girl
for
i
thought
he
might
mean
honestly
by
her
so
that
there
might
be
no
talk
or
chance
of
talk
on
the
part
of
others
i
went
where
i
should
meet
him
with
none
by
and
we
met'
here
jacob
settle
had
to
pause
for
something
seemed
to
rise
in
his
throat
and
he
almost
gasped
for
breath
then
he
went
on
'sir
as
god
is
above
us
there
was
no
selfish
thought
in
my
heart
that
day
i
loved
my
pretty
mabel
too
well
to
be
content
with
a
part
of
her
love
and
i
had
thought
of
my
own
unhappiness
too
often
not
to
have
come
to
realise
that
whatever
might
come
to
her
my
hope
was
gone
he
was
insolent
to
me--you
sir
who
are
a
gentleman
cannot
know
perhaps
how
galling
can
be
the
insolence
of
one
who
is
above
you
in
station--but
i
bore
with
that
i
implored
him
to
deal
well
with
the
girl
for
what
might
be
only
a
pastime
of
an
idle
hour
with
him
might
be
the
breaking
of
her
heart
for
i
never
had
a
thought
of
her
truth
or
that
the
worst
of
harm
could
come
to
her--it
was
only
the
unhappiness
to
her
heart
i
feared
but
when
i
asked
him
when
he
intended
to
marry
her
his
laughter
galled
me
so
that
i
lost
my
temper
and
told
him
that
i
would
not
stand
by
and
see
her
life
made
unhappy
then
he
grew
angry
too
and
in
his
anger
said
such
cruel
things
of
her
that
then
and
there
i
swore
he
should
not
live
to
do
her
harm
god
knows
how
it
came
about
for
in
such
moments
of
passion
it
is
hard
to
remember
the
steps
from
a
word
to
a
blow
but
i
found
myself
standing
over
his
dead
body
with
my
hands
crimson
with
the
blood
that
welled
from
his
torn
throat
we
were
alone
and
he
was
a
stranger
with
none
of
his
kin
to
seek
for
him
and
murder
does
not
always
out--not
all
at
once
his
bones
may
be
whitening
still
for
all
i
know
in
the
pool
of
the
river
where
i
left
him
no
one
suspected
his
absence
or
why
it
was
except
my
poor
mabel
and
she
dared
not
speak
but
it
was
all
in
vain
for
when
i
came
back
again
after
an
absence
of
months--for
i
could
not
live
in
the
place--i
learned
that
her
shame
had
come
and
that
she
had
died
in
it
hitherto
i
had
been
borne
up
by
the
thought
that
my
ill
deed
had
saved
her
future
but
now
when
i
learned
that
i
had
been
too
late
and
that
my
poor
love
was
smirched
with
that
man's
sin
i
fled
away
with
the
sense
of
my
useless
guilt
upon
me
more
heavily
than
i
could
bear
ah
sir
you
that
have
not
done
such
a
sin
don't
know
what
it
is
to
carry
it
with
you
you
may
think
that
custom
makes
it
easy
to
you
but
it
is
not
so
it
grows
and
grows
with
every
hour
till
it
becomes
intolerable
and
with
it
growing
too
the
feeling
that
you
must
for
ever
stand
outside
heaven
you
don't
know
what
that
means
and
i
pray
god
that
you
never
may
ordinary
men
to
whom
all
things
are
possible
don't
often
if
ever
think
of
heaven
it
is
a
name
and
nothing
more
and
they
are
content
to
wait
and
let
things
be
but
to
those
who
are
doomed
to
be
shut
out
for
ever
you
cannot
think
what
it
means
you
cannot
guess
or
measure
the
terrible
endless
longing
to
see
the
gates
opened
and
to
be
able
to
join
the
white
figures
within
'and
this
brings
me
to
my
dream
it
seemed
that
the
portal
was
before
me
with
great
gates
of
massive
steel
with
bars
of
the
thickness
of
a
mast
rising
to
the
very
clouds
and
so
close
that
between
them
was
just
a
glimpse
of
a
crystal
grotto
on
whose
shining
walls
were
figured
many
white-clad
forms
with
faces
radiant
with
joy
when
i
stood
before
the
gate
my
heart
and
my
soul
were
so
full
of
rapture
and
longing
that
i
forgot
and
there
stood
at
the
gate
two
mighty
angels
with
sweeping
wings
and
oh
so
stern
of
countenance
they
held
each
in
one
hand
a
flaming
sword
and
in
the
other
the
latchet
which
moved
to
and
fro
at
their
lightest
touch
nearer
were
figures
all
draped
in
black
with
heads
covered
so
that
only
the
eyes
were
seen
and
they
handed
to
each
who
came
white
garments
such
as
the
angels
wear
a
low
murmur
came
that
told
that
all
should
put
on
their
own
robes
and
without
soil
or
the
angels
would
not
pass
them
in
but
would
smite
them
down
with
the
flaming
swords
i
was
eager
to
don
my
own
garment
and
hurriedly
threw
it
over
me
and
stepped
swiftly
to
the
gate
but
it
moved
not
and
the
angels
loosing
the
latchet
pointed
to
my
dress
i
looked
down
and
was
aghast
for
the
whole
robe
was
smeared
with
blood
my
hands
were
red
they
glittered
with
the
blood
that
dripped
from
them
as
on
that
day
by
the
river
bank
and
then
the
angels
raised
their
flaming
swords
to
smite
me
down
and
the
horror
was
complete--i
awoke
again
and
again
and
again
that
awful
dream
comes
to
me
i
never
learn
from
the
experience
i
never
remember
but
at
the
beginning
the
hope
is
ever
there
to
make
the
end
more
appalling
and
i
know
that
the
dream
does
not
come
out
of
the
common
darkness
where
the
dreams
abide
but
that
it
is
sent
from
god
as
a
punishment
never
never
shall
i
be
able
to
pass
the
gate
for
the
soil
on
the
angel
garments
must
ever
come
from
these
bloody
hands'
i
listened
as
in
a
spell
as
jacob
settle
spoke
there
was
something
so
far
away
in
the
tone
of
his
voice--something
so
dreamy
and
mystic
in
the
eyes
that
looked
as
if
through
me
at
some
spirit
beyond--something
so
lofty
in
his
very
diction
and
in
such
marked
contrast
to
his
workworn
clothes
and
his
poor
surroundings
that
i
wondered
if
the
whole
thing
were
not
a
dream
we
were
both
silent
for
a
long
time
i
kept
looking
at
the
man
before
me
in
growing
wonderment
now
that
his
confession
had
been
made
his
soul
which
had
been
crushed
to
the
very
earth
seemed
to
leap
back
again
to
uprightness
with
some
resilient
force
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
been
horrified
with
his
story
but
strange
to
say
i
was
not
it
certainly
is
not
pleasant
to
be
made
the
recipient
of
the
confidence
of
a
murderer
but
this
poor
fellow
seemed
to
have
had
not
only
so
much
provocation
but
so
much
self-denying
purpose
in
his
deed
of
blood
that
i
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
pass
judgment
upon
him
my
purpose
was
to
comfort
so
i
spoke
out
with
what
calmness
i
could
for
my
heart
was
beating
fast
and
heavily
'you
need
not
despair
jacob
settle
god
is
very
good
and
his
mercy
is
great
live
on
and
work
on
in
the
hope
that
some
day
you
may
feel
that
you
have
atoned
for
the
past'
here
i
paused
for
i
could
see
that
deep
natural
sleep
this
time
was
creeping
upon
him
'go
to
sleep'
i
said
'i
shall
watch
with
you
here
and
we
shall
have
no
more
evil
dreams
tonight'
he
made
an
effort
to
pull
himself
together
and
answered
'i
don't
know
how
to
thank
you
for
your
goodness
to
me
this
night
but
i
think
you
had
best
leave
me
now
i'll
try
and
sleep
this
out
i
feel
a
weight
off
my
mind
since
i
have
told
you
all
if
there's
anything
of
the
man
left
in
me
i
must
try
and
fight
out
life
alone'
'i'll
go
tonight
as
you
wish
it'
i
said
'but
take
my
advice
and
do
not
live
in
such
a
solitary
way
go
among
men
and
women
live
among
them
share
their
joys
and
sorrows
and
it
will
help
you
to
forget
this
solitude
will
make
you
melancholy
mad'
'i
will'
he
answered
half
unconsciously
for
sleep
was
overmastering
him
i
turned
to
go
and
he
looked
after
me
when
i
had
touched
the
latch
i
dropped
it
and
coming
back
to
the
bed
held
out
my
hand
he
grasped
it
with
both
his
as
he
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
and
i
said
my
goodnight
trying
to
cheer
him
'heart
man
heart
there
is
work
in
the
world
for
you
to
do
jacob
settle
you
can
wear
those
white
robes
yet
and
pass
through
that
gate
of
steel'
then
i
left
him
a
week
after
i
found
his
cottage
deserted
and
on
asking
at
the
works
was
told
that
he
had
'gone
north'
no
one
exactly
knew
whither
two
years
afterwards
i
was
staying
for
a
few
days
with
my
friend
dr
munro
in
glasgow
he
was
a
busy
man
and
could
not
spare
much
time
for
going
about
with
me
so
i
spent
my
days
in
excursions
to
the
trossachs
and
loch
katrine
and
down
the
clyde
on
the
second
last
evening
of
my
stay
i
came
back
somewhat
later
than
i
had
arranged
but
found
that
my
host
was
late
too
the
maid
told
me
that
he
had
been
sent
for
to
the
hospital--a
case
of
accident
at
the
gas-works
and
the
dinner
was
postponed
an
hour
so
telling
her
i
would
stroll
down
to
find
her
master
and
walk
back
with
him
i
went
out
at
the
hospital
i
found
him
washing
his
hands
preparatory
to
starting
for
home
casually
i
asked
him
what
his
case
was
'oh
the
usual
thing
a
rotten
rope
and
men's
lives
of
no
account
two
men
were
working
in
a
gasometer
when
the
rope
that
held
their
scaffolding
broke
it
must
have
occurred
just
before
the
dinner
hour
for
no
one
noticed
their
absence
till
the
men
had
returned
there
was
about
seven
feet
of
water
in
the
gasometer
so
they
had
a
hard
fight
for
it
poor
fellows
however
one
of
them
was
alive
just
alive
but
we
have
had
a
hard
job
to
pull
him
through
it
seems
that
he
owes
his
life
to
his
mate
for
i
have
never
heard
of
greater
heroism
they
swam
together
while
their
strength
lasted
but
at
the
end
they
were
so
done
up
that
even
the
lights
above
and
the
men
slung
with
ropes
coming
down
to
help
them
could
not
keep
them
up
but
one
of
them
stood
on
the
bottom
and
held
up
his
comrade
over
his
head
and
those
few
breaths
made
all
the
difference
between
life
and
death
they
were
a
shocking
sight
when
they
were
taken
out
for
that
water
is
like
a
purple
dye
with
the
gas
and
the
tar
the
man
upstairs
looked
as
if
he
had
been
washed
in
blood
ugh'
'and
the
other'
'oh
he's
worse
still
but
he
must
have
been
a
very
noble
fellow
that
struggle
under
the
water
must
have
been
fearful
one
can
see
that
by
the
way
the
blood
has
been
drawn
from
the
extremities
it
makes
the
idea
of
the
stigmata
possible
to
look
at
him
resolution
like
this
could
you
would
think
do
anything
in
the
world
ay
it
might
almost
unbar
the
gates
of
heaven
look
here
old
man
it
is
not
a
very
pleasant
sight
especially
just
before
dinner
but
you
are
a
writer
and
this
is
an
odd
case
here
is
something
you
would
not
like
to
miss
for
in
all
human
probability
you
will
never
see
anything
like
it
again'
while
he
was
speaking
he
had
brought
me
into
the
mortuary
of
the
hospital
on
the
bier
lay
a
body
covered
with
a
white
sheet
which
was
wrapped
close
round
it
'looks
like
a
chrysalis
don't
it
i
say
jack
if
there
be
anything
in
the
old
myth
that
a
soul
is
typified
by
a
butterfly
well
then
the
one
that
this
chrysalis
sent
forth
was
a
very
noble
specimen
and
took
all
the
sunlight
on
its
wings
see
here'
he
uncovered
the
face
horrible
indeed
it
looked
as
though
stained
with
blood
but
i
knew
him
at
once
jacob
settle
my
friend
pulled
the
winding
sheet
further
down
the
hands
were
crossed
on
the
purple
breast
as
they
had
been
reverently
placed
by
some
tender-hearted
person
as
i
saw
them
my
heart
throbbed
with
a
great
exultation
for
the
memory
of
his
harrowing
dream
rushed
across
my
mind
there
was
no
stain
now
on
those
poor
brave
hands
for
they
were
blanched
white
as
snow
and
somehow
as
i
looked
i
felt
that
the
evil
dream
was
all
over
that
noble
soul
had
won
a
way
through
the
gate
at
last
the
white
robe
had
now
no
stain
from
the
hands
that
had
put
it
on
crooken
sands
mr
arthur
fernlee
markam
who
took
what
was
known
as
the
red
house
above
the
mains
of
crooken
was
a
london
merchant
and
being
essentially
a
cockney
thought
it
necessary
when
he
went
for
the
summer
holidays
to
scotland
to
provide
an
entire
rig-out
as
a
highland
chieftain
as
manifested
in
chromolithographs
and
on
the
music-hall
stage
he
had
once
seen
in
the
empire
the
great
prince--'the
bounder
king'--bring
down
the
house
by
appearing
as
'the
macslogan
of
that
ilk'
and
singing
the
celebrated
scotch
song
'there's
naething
like
haggis
to
mak
a
mon
dry'
and
he
had
ever
since
preserved
in
his
mind
a
faithful
image
of
the
picturesque
and
warlike
appearance
which
he
presented
indeed
if
the
true
inwardness
of
mr
markam's
mind
on
the
subject
of
his
selection
of
aberdeenshire
as
a
summer
resort
were
known
it
would
be
found
that
in
the
foreground
of
the
holiday
locality
which
his
fancy
painted
stalked
the
many
hued
figure
of
the
macslogan
of
that
ilk
however
be
this
as
it
may
a
very
kind
fortune--certainly
so
far
as
external
beauty
was
concerned--led
him
to
the
choice
of
crooken
bay
it
is
a
lovely
spot
between
aberdeen
and
peterhead
just
under
the
rock-bound
headland
whence
the
long
dangerous
reefs
known
as
the
spurs
run
out
into
the
north
sea
between
this
and
the
'mains
of
crooken'--a
village
sheltered
by
the
northern
cliffs--lies
the
deep
bay
backed
with
a
multitude
of
bent-grown
dunes
where
the
rabbits
are
to
be
found
in
thousands
thus
at
either
end
of
the
bay
is
a
rocky
promontory
and
when
the
dawn
or
the
sunset
falls
on
the
rocks
of
red
syenite
the
effect
is
very
lovely
the
bay
itself
is
floored
with
level
sand
and
the
tide
runs
far
out
leaving
a
smooth
waste
of
hard
sand
on
which
are
dotted
here
and
there
the
stake
nets
and
bag
nets
of
the
salmon
fishers
at
one
end
of
the
bay
there
is
a
little
group
or
cluster
of
rocks
whose
heads
are
raised
something
above
high
water
except
when
in
rough
weather
the
waves
come
over
them
green
at
low
tide
they
are
exposed
down
to
sand
level
and
here
is
perhaps
the
only
little
bit
of
dangerous
sand
on
this
part
of
the
eastern
coast
between
the
rocks
which
are
apart
about
some
fifty
feet
is
a
small
quicksand
which
like
the
goodwins
is
dangerous
only
with
the
incoming
tide
it
extends
outwards
till
it
is
lost
in
the
sea
and
inwards
till
it
fades
away
in
the
hard
sand
of
the
upper
beach
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
which
rises
beyond
the
dunes
midway
between
the
spurs
and
the
port
of
crooken
is
the
red
house
it
rises
from
the
midst
of
a
clump
of
fir-trees
which
protect
it
on
three
sides
leaving
the
whole
sea
front
open
a
trim
old-fashioned
garden
stretches
down
to
the
roadway
on
crossing
which
a
grassy
path
which
can
be
used
for
light
vehicles
threads
a
way
to
the
shore
winding
amongst
the
sand
hills
when
the
markam
family
arrived
at
the
red
house
after
their
thirty-six
hours
of
pitching
on
the
aberdeen
steamer
ban
righ
from
blackwall
with
the
subsequent
train
to
yellon
and
drive
of
a
dozen
miles
they
all
agreed
that
they
had
never
seen
a
more
delightful
spot
the
general
satisfaction
was
more
marked
as
at
that
very
time
none
of
the
family
were
for
several
reasons
inclined
to
find
favourable
anything
or
any
place
over
the
scottish
border
though
the
family
was
a
large
one
the
prosperity
of
the
business
allowed
them
all
sorts
of
personal
luxuries
amongst
which
was
a
wide
latitude
in
the
way
of
dress
the
frequency
of
the
markam
girls'
new
frocks
was
a
source
of
envy
to
their
bosom
friends
and
of
joy
to
themselves
arthur
fernlee
markam
had
not
taken
his
family
into
his
confidence
regarding
his
new
costume
he
was
not
quite
certain
that
he
should
be
free
from
ridicule
or
at
least
from
sarcasm
and
as
he
was
sensitive
on
the
subject
he
thought
it
better
to
be
actually
in
the
suitable
environment
before
he
allowed
the
full
splendour
to
burst
upon
them
he
had
taken
some
pains
to
insure
the
completeness
of
the
highland
costume
for
the
purpose
he
had
paid
many
visits
to
'the
scotch
all-wool
tartan
clothing
mart'
which
had
been
lately
established
in
copthall-court
by
the
messrs
maccallum
more
and
roderick
macdhu
he
had
anxious
consultations
with
the
head
of
the
firm--maccallum
as
he
called
himself
resenting
any
such
additions
as
'mr'
or
'esquire'
the
known
stock
of
buckles
buttons
straps
brooches
and
ornaments
of
all
kinds
were
examined
in
critical
detail
and
at
last
an
eagle's
feather
of
sufficiently
magnificent
proportions
was
discovered
and
the
equipment
was
complete
it
was
only
when
he
saw
the
finished
costume
with
the
vivid
hues
of
the
tartan
seemingly
modified
into
comparative
sobriety
by
the
multitude
of
silver
fittings
the
cairngorm
brooches
the
philibeg
dirk
and
sporran
that
he
was
fully
and
absolutely
satisfied
with
his
choice
at
first
he
had
thought
of
the
royal
stuart
dress
tartan
but
abandoned
it
on
the
maccallum
pointing
out
that
if
he
should
happen
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
balmoral
it
might
lead
to
complications
the
maccallum
who
by
the
way
spoke
with
a
remarkable
cockney
accent
suggested
other
plaids
in
turn
but
now
that
the
other
question
of
accuracy
had
been
raised
mr
markam
foresaw
difficulties
if
he
should
by
chance
find
himself
in
the
locality
of
the
clan
whose
colours
he
had
usurped
the
maccallum
at
last
undertook
to
have
at
markam's
expense
a
special
pattern
woven
which
would
not
be
exactly
the
same
as
any
existing
tartan
though
partaking
of
the
characteristics
of
many
it
was
based
on
the
royal
stuart
but
contained
suggestions
as
to
simplicity
of
pattern
from
the
macalister
and
ogilvie
clans
and
as
to
neutrality
of
colour
from
the
clans
of
buchanan
macbeth
chief
of
macintosh
and
macleod
when
the
specimen
had
been
shown
to
markam
he
had
feared
somewhat
lest
it
should
strike
the
eye
of
his
domestic
circle
as
gaudy
but
as
roderick
macdhu
fell
into
perfect
ecstasies
over
its
beauty
he
did
not
make
any
objection
to
the
completion
of
the
piece
he
thought
and
wisely
that
if
a
genuine
scotchman
like
macdhu
liked
it
it
must
be
right--especially
as
the
junior
partner
was
a
man
very
much
of
his
own
build
and
appearance
when
the
maccallum
was
receiving
his
cheque--which
by
the
way
was
a
pretty
stiff
one--he
remarked
'i've
taken
the
liberty
of
having
some
more
of
the
stuff
woven
in
case
you
or
any
of
your
friends
should
want
it'
markam
was
gratified
and
told
him
that
he
should
be
only
too
happy
if
the
beautiful
stuff
which
they
had
originated
between
them
should
become
a
favourite
as
he
had
no
doubt
it
would
in
time
he
might
make
and
sell
as
much
as
he
would
markam
tried
the
dress
on
in
his
office
one
evening
after
the
clerks
had
all
gone
home
he
was
pleased
though
a
little
frightened
at
the
result
the
maccallum
had
done
his
work
thoroughly
and
there
was
nothing
omitted
that
could
add
to
the
martial
dignity
of
the
wearer
'i
shall
not
of
course
take
the
claymore
and
the
pistols
with
me
on
ordinary
occasions'
said
markam
to
himself
as
he
began
to
undress
he
determined
that
he
would
wear
the
dress
for
the
first
time
on
landing
in
scotland
and
accordingly
on
the
morning
when
the
ban
righ
was
hanging
off
the
girdle
ness
lighthouse
waiting
for
the
tide
to
enter
the
port
of
aberdeen
he
emerged
from
his
cabin
in
all
the
gaudy
splendour
of
his
new
costume
the
first
comment
he
heard
was
from
one
of
his
own
sons
who
did
not
recognise
him
at
first
'here's
a
guy
great
scott
it's
the
governor'
and
the
boy
fled
forthwith
and
tried
to
bury
his
laughter
under
a
cushion
in
the
saloon
markam
was
a
good
sailor
and
had
not
suffered
from
the
pitching
of
the
boat
so
that
his
naturally
rubicund
face
was
even
more
rosy
by
the
conscious
blush
which
suffused
his
cheeks
when
he
had
found
himself
at
once
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
he
could
have
wished
that
he
had
not
been
so
bold
for
he
knew
from
the
cold
that
there
was
a
big
bare
spot
under
one
side
of
his
jauntily
worn
glengarry
cap
however
he
faced
the
group
of
strangers
boldly
he
was
not
outwardly
upset
even
when
some
of
the
comments
reached
his
ears
'he's
off
his
bloomin'
chump'
said
a
cockney
in
a
suit
of
exaggerated
plaid
'there's
flies
on
him'
said
a
tall
thin
yankee
pale
with
sea-sickness
who
was
on
his
way
to
take
up
his
residence
for
a
time
as
close
as
he
could
get
to
the
gates
of
balmoral
'happy
thought
let
us
fill
our
mulls
now's
the
chance'
said
a
young
oxford
man
on
his
way
home
to
inverness
but
presently
mr
markam
heard
the
voice
of
his
eldest
daughter
'where
is
he
where
is
he'
and
she
came
tearing
along
the
deck
with
her
hat
blowing
behind
her
her
face
showed
signs
of
agitation
for
her
mother
had
just
been
telling
her
of
her
father's
condition
but
when
she
saw
him
she
instantly
burst
into
laughter
so
violent
that
it
ended
in
a
fit
of
hysterics
something
of
the
same
kind
happened
to
each
of
the
other
children
when
they
had
all
had
their
turn
mr
markam
went
to
his
cabin
and
sent
his
wife's
maid
to
tell
each
member
of
the
family
that
he
wanted
to
see
them
at
once
they
all
made
their
appearance
suppressing
their
feelings
as
well
as
they
could
he
said
to
them
very
quietly
'my
dears
don't
i
provide
you
all
with
ample
allowances'
'yes
father'
they
all
answered
gravely
'no
one
could
be
more
generous'
'don't
i
let
you
dress
as
you
please'
'yes
father'--this
a
little
sheepishly
'then
my
dears
don't
you
think
it
would
be
nicer
and
kinder
of
you
not
to
try
and
make
me
feel
uncomfortable
even
if
i
do
assume
a
dress
which
is
ridiculous
in
your
eyes
though
quite
common
enough
in
the
country
where
we
are
about
to
sojourn'
there
was
no
answer
except
that
which
appeared
in
their
hanging
heads
he
was
a
good
father
and
they
all
knew
it
he
was
quite
satisfied
and
went
on
'there
now
run
away
and
enjoy
yourselves
we
shan't
have
another
word
about
it'
then
he
went
on
deck
again
and
stood
bravely
the
fire
of
ridicule
which
he
recognised
around
him
though
nothing
more
was
said
within
his
hearing
the
astonishment
and
the
amusement
which
his
get-up
occasioned
on
the
ban
righ
was
however
nothing
to
that
which
it
created
in
aberdeen
the
boys
and
loafers
and
women
with
babies
who
waited
at
the
landing
shed
followed
en
masse
as
the
markam
party
took
their
way
to
the
railway
station
even
the
porters
with
their
old-fashioned
knots
and
their
new-fashioned
barrows
who
await
the
traveller
at
the
foot
of
the
gang-plank
followed
in
wondering
delight
fortunately
the
peterhead
train
was
just
about
to
start
so
that
the
martyrdom
was
not
unnecessarily
prolonged
in
the
carriage
the
glorious
highland
costume
was
unseen
and
as
there
were
but
few
persons
at
the
station
at
yellon
all
went
well
there
when
however
the
carriage
drew
near
the
mains
of
crooken
and
the
fisher
folk
had
run
to
their
doors
to
see
who
it
was
that
was
passing
the
excitement
exceeded
all
bounds
the
children
with
one
impulse
waved
their
bonnets
and
ran
shouting
behind
the
carriage
the
men
forsook
their
nets
and
their
baiting
and
followed
the
women
clutched
their
babies
and
followed
also
the
horses
were
tired
after
their
long
journey
to
yellon
and
back
and
the
hill
was
steep
so
that
there
was
ample
time
for
the
crowd
to
gather
and
even
to
pass
on
ahead
mrs
markam
and
the
elder
girls
would
have
liked
to
make
some
protest
or
to
do
something
to
relieve
their
feelings
of
chagrin
at
the
ridicule
which
they
saw
on
all
faces
but
there
was
a
look
of
fixed
determination
on
the
face
of
the
seeming
highlander
which
awed
them
a
little
and
they
were
silent
it
might
have
been
that
the
eagle's
feather
even
when
arising
above
the
bald
head
the
cairngorm
brooch
even
on
the
fat
shoulder
and
the
claymore
dirk
and
pistols
even
when
belted
round
the
extensive
paunch
and
protruding
from
the
stocking
on
the
sturdy
calf
fulfilled
their
existence
as
symbols
of
martial
and
terrifying
import
when
the
party
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
red
house
there
awaited
them
a
crowd
of
crooken
inhabitants
hatless
and
respectfully
silent
the
remainder
of
the
population
was
painfully
toiling
up
the
hill
the
silence
was
broken
by
only
one
sound
that
of
a
man
with
a
deep
voice
'man
but
he's
forgotten
the
pipes'
the
servants
had
arrived
some
days
before
and
all
things
were
in
readiness
in
the
glow
consequent
on
a
good
lunch
after
a
hard
journey
all
the
disagreeables
of
travel
and
all
the
chagrin
consequent
on
the
adoption
of
the
obnoxious
costume
were
forgotten
that
afternoon
markam
still
clad
in
full
array
walked
through
the
mains
of
crooken
he
was
all
alone
for
strange
to
say
his
wife
and
both
daughters
had
sick
headaches
and
were
as
he
was
told
lying
down
to
rest
after
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
his
eldest
son
who
claimed
to
be
a
young
man
had
gone
out
by
himself
to
explore
the
surroundings
of
the
place
and
one
of
the
boys
could
not
be
found
the
other
boy
on
being
told
that
his
father
had
sent
for
him
to
come
for
a
walk
had
managed--by
accident
of
course--to
fall
into
the
water
butt
and
had
to
be
dried
and
rigged
out
afresh
his
clothes
not
having
been
as
yet
unpacked
this
was
of
course
impossible
without
delay
mr
markam
was
not
quite
satisfied
with
his
walk
he
could
not
meet
any
of
his
neighbours
it
was
not
that
there
were
not
enough
people
about
for
every
house
and
cottage
seemed
to
be
full
but
the
people
when
in
the
open
were
either
in
their
doorways
some
distance
behind
him
or
on
the
roadway
a
long
distance
in
front
as
he
passed
he
could
see
the
tops
of
heads
and
the
whites
of
eyes
in
the
windows
or
round
the
corners
of
doors
the
only
interview
which
he
had
was
anything
but
a
pleasant
one
this
was
with
an
odd
sort
of
old
man
who
was
hardly
ever
heard
to
speak
except
to
join
in
the
'amens'
in
the
meeting-house
his
sole
occupation
seemed
to
be
to
wait
at
the
window
of
the
post-office
from
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
till
the
arrival
of
the
mail
at
one
when
he
carried
the
letter-bag
to
a
neighbouring
baronial
castle
the
remainder
of
his
day
was
spent
on
a
seat
in
a
draughty
part
of
the
port
where
the
offal
of
the
fish
the
refuse
of
the
bait
and
the
house
rubbish
was
thrown
and
where
the
ducks
were
accustomed
to
hold
high
revel
when
saft
tammie
beheld
him
coming
he
raised
his
eyes
which
were
generally
fixed
on
the
nothing
which
lay
on
the
roadway
opposite
his
seat
and
seeming
dazzled
as
if
by
a
burst
of
sunshine
rubbed
them
and
shaded
them
with
his
hand
then
he
started
up
and
raised
his
hand
aloft
in
a
denunciatory
manner
as
he
spoke--
'vanity
of
vanities
saith
the
preacher
all
is
vanity
mon
be
warned
in
time
behold
the
lilies
of
the
field
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
yet
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these
mon
mon
thy
vanity
is
as
the
quicksand
which
swallows
up
all
which
comes
within
its
spell
beware
vanity
beware
the
quicksand
which
yawneth
for
thee
and
which
will
swallow
thee
up
see
thyself
learn
thine
own
vanity
meet
thyself
face
to
face
and
then
in
that
moment
thou
shalt
learn
the
fatal
force
of
thy
vanity
learn
it
know
it
and
repent
ere
the
quicksand
swallow
thee'
then
without
another
word
he
went
back
to
his
seat
and
sat
there
immovable
and
expressionless
as
before
markam
could
not
but
feel
a
little
upset
by
this
tirade
only
that
it
was
spoken
by
a
seeming
madman
he
would
have
put
it
down
to
some
eccentric
exhibition
of
scottish
humour
or
impudence
but
the
gravity
of
the
message--for
it
seemed
nothing
else--made
such
a
reading
impossible
he
was
however
determined
not
to
give
in
to
ridicule
and
although
he
had
not
yet
seen
anything
in
scotland
to
remind
him
even
of
a
kilt
he
determined
to
wear
his
highland
dress
when
he
returned
home
in
less
than
half-an-hour
he
found
that
every
member
of
the
family
was
despite
the
headaches
out
taking
a
walk
he
took
the
opportunity
afforded
by
their
absence
of
locking
himself
in
his
dressing-room
took
off
the
highland
dress
and
putting
on
a
suit
of
flannels
lit
a
cigar
and
had
a
snooze
he
was
awakened
by
the
noise
of
the
family
coming
in
and
at
once
donning
his
dress
made
his
appearance
in
the
drawing-room
for
tea
he
did
not
go
out
again
that
afternoon
but
after
dinner
he
put
on
his
dress
again--he
had
of
course
dressed
for
dinner
as
usual--and
went
by
himself
for
a
walk
on
the
sea-shore
he
had
by
this
time
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
get
by
degrees
accustomed
to
the
highland
dress
before
making
it
his
ordinary
wear
the
moon
was
up
and
he
easily
followed
the
path
through
the
sand-hills
and
shortly
struck
the
shore
the
tide
was
out
and
the
beach
firm
as
a
rock
so
he
strolled
southwards
to
nearly
the
end
of
the
bay
here
he
was
attracted
by
two
isolated
rocks
some
little
way
out
from
the
edge
of
the
dunes
so
he
strolled
towards
them
when
he
reached
the
nearest
one
he
climbed
it
and
sitting
there
elevated
some
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
over
the
waste
of
sand
enjoyed
the
lovely
peaceful
prospect
the
moon
was
rising
behind
the
headland
of
pennyfold
and
its
light
was
just
touching
the
top
of
the
furthermost
rock
of
the
spurs
some
three-quarters
of
a
mile
out
the
rest
of
the
rocks
were
in
dark
shadow
as
the
moon
rose
over
the
headland
the
rocks
of
the
spurs
and
then
the
beach
by
degrees
became
flooded
with
light
for
a
good
while
mr
markam
sat
and
looked
at
the
rising
moon
and
the
growing
area
of
light
which
followed
its
rise
then
he
turned
and
faced
eastwards
and
sat
with
his
chin
in
his
hand
looking
seawards
and
revelling
in
the
peace
and
beauty
and
freedom
of
the
scene
the
roar
of
london--the
darkness
and
the
strife
and
weariness
of
london
life--seemed
to
have
passed
quite
away
and
he
lived
at
the
moment
a
freer
and
higher
life
he
looked
at
the
glistening
water
as
it
stole
its
way
over
the
flat
waste
of
sand
coming
closer
and
closer
insensibly--the
tide
had
turned
presently
he
heard
a
distant
shouting
along
the
beach
very
far
off
'the
fishermen
calling
to
each
other'
he
said
to
himself
and
looked
around
as
he
did
so
he
got
a
horrible
shock
for
though
just
then
a
cloud
sailed
across
the
moon
he
saw
in
spite
of
the
sudden
darkness
around
him
his
own
image
for
an
instant
on
the
top
of
the
opposite
rock
he
could
see
the
bald
back
of
the
head
and
the
glengarry
cap
with
the
immense
eagle's
feather
as
he
staggered
back
his
foot
slipped
and
he
began
to
slide
down
towards
the
sand
between
the
two
rocks
he
took
no
concern
as
to
falling
for
the
sand
was
really
only
a
few
feet
below
him
and
his
mind
was
occupied
with
the
figure
or
simulacrum
of
himself
which
had
already
disappeared
as
the
easiest
way
of
reaching
terra
firma
he
prepared
to
jump
the
remainder
of
the
distance
all
this
had
taken
but
a
second
but
the
brain
works
quickly
and
even
as
he
gathered
himself
for
the
spring
he
saw
the
sand
below
him
lying
so
marbly
level
shake
and
shiver
in
an
odd
way
a
sudden
fear
overcame
him
his
knees
failed
and
instead
of
jumping
he
slid
miserably
down
the
rock
scratching
his
bare
legs
as
he
went
his
feet
touched
the
sand--went
through
it
like
water--and
he
was
down
below
his
knees
before
he
realised
that
he
was
in
a
quicksand
wildly
he
grasped
at
the
rock
to
keep
himself
from
sinking
further
and
fortunately
there
was
a
jutting
spur
or
edge
which
he
was
able
to
grasp
instinctively
to
this
he
clung
in
grim
desperation
he
tried
to
shout
but
his
breath
would
not
come
till
after
a
great
effort
his
voice
rang
out
again
he
shouted
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
gave
him
new
courage
for
he
was
able
to
hold
on
to
the
rock
for
a
longer
time
than
he
thought
possible--though
he
held
on
only
in
blind
desperation
he
was
however
beginning
to
find
his
grasp
weakening
when
joy
of
joys
his
shout
was
answered
by
a
rough
voice
from
just
above
him
'god
be
thankit
i'm
nae
too
late'
and
a
fisherman
with
great
thigh-boots
came
hurriedly
climbing
over
the
rock
in
an
instant
he
recognised
the
gravity
of
the
danger
and
with
a
cheering
'haud
fast
mon
i'm
comin''
scrambled
down
till
he
found
a
firm
foothold
then
with
one
strong
hand
holding
the
rock
above
he
leaned
down
and
catching
markam's
wrist
called
out
to
him
'haud
to
me
mon
haud
to
me
wi'
ither
hond'
then
he
lent
his
great
strength
and
with
a
steady
sturdy
pull
dragged
him
out
of
the
hungry
quicksand
and
placed
him
safe
upon
the
rock
hardly
giving
him
time
to
draw
breath
he
pulled
and
pushed
him--never
letting
him
go
for
an
instant--over
the
rock
into
the
firm
sand
beyond
it
and
finally
deposited
him
still
shaking
from
the
magnitude
of
his
danger
high
upon
the
beach
then
he
began
to
speak
'mon
but
i
was
just
in
time
if
i
had
no
laucht
at
yon
foolish
lads
and
begun
to
rin
at
the
first
you'd
a
bin
sinkin'
doon
to
the
bowels
o'
the
airth
be
the
noo
wully
beagrie
thocht
you
was
a
ghaist
and
tom
macphail
swore
ye
was
only
like
a
goblin
on
a
puddick-steel
na
said
i
yon's
but
the
daft
englishman--the
loony
that
had
escapit
frae
the
waxwarks
i
was
thinkin'
that
bein'
strange
and
silly--if
not
a
whole-made
feel--ye'd
no
ken
the
ways
o'
the
quicksan'
i
shouted
till
warn
ye
and
then
ran
to
drag
ye
aff
if
need
be
but
god
be
thankit
be
ye
fule
or
only
half-daft
wi'
yer
vanity
that
i
was
no
that
late'
and
he
reverently
lifted
his
cap
as
he
spoke
mr
markam
was
deeply
touched
and
thankful
for
his
escape
from
a
horrible
death
but
the
sting
of
the
charge
of
vanity
thus
made
once
more
against
him
came
through
his
humility
he
was
about
to
reply
angrily
when
suddenly
a
great
awe
fell
upon
him
as
he
remembered
the
warning
words
of
the
half-crazy
letter-carrier
'meet
thyself
face
to
face
and
repent
ere
the
quicksand
shall
swallow
thee'
here
too
he
remembered
the
image
of
himself
that
he
had
seen
and
the
sudden
danger
from
the
deadly
quicksand
that
had
followed
he
was
silent
a
full
minute
and
then
said
'my
good
fellow
i
owe
you
my
life'
the
answer
came
with
reverence
from
the
hardy
fisherman
'na
na
ye
owe
that
to
god
but
as
for
me
i'm
only
too
glad
till
be
the
humble
instrument
o'
his
mercy'
'but
you
will
let
me
thank
you'
said
mr
markam
taking
both
the
great
hands
of
his
deliverer
in
his
and
holding
them
tight
'my
heart
is
too
full
as
yet
and
my
nerves
are
too
much
shaken
to
let
me
say
much
but
believe
me
i
am
very
very
grateful'
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
poor
old
fellow
was
deeply
touched
for
the
tears
were
running
down
his
cheeks
the
fisherman
said
with
a
rough
but
true
courtesy
'ay
sir
thank
me
and
ye
will--if
it'll
do
yer
poor
heart
good
an'
i'm
thinking
that
if
it
were
me
i'd
be
thankful
too
but
sir
as
for
me
i
need
no
thanks
i
am
glad
so
i
am'
that
arthur
fernlee
markam
was
really
thankful
and
grateful
was
shown
practically
later
on
within
a
week's
time
there
sailed
into
port
crooken
the
finest
fishing
smack
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
the
harbour
of
peterhead
she
was
fully
found
with
sails
and
gear
of
all
kinds
and
with
nets
of
the
best
her
master
and
men
went
away
by
the
coach
after
having
left
with
the
salmon-fisher's
wife
the
papers
which
made
her
over
to
him
as
mr
markam
and
the
salmon-fisher
walked
together
along
the
shore
the
former
asked
his
companion
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
he
had
been
in
such
imminent
danger
for
that
it
would
only
distress
his
dear
wife
and
children
he
said
that
he
would
warn
them
all
of
the
quicksand
and
for
that
purpose
he
then
and
there
asked
questions
about
it
till
he
felt
that
his
information
on
the
subject
was
complete
before
they
parted
he
asked
his
companion
if
he
had
happened
to
see
a
second
figure
dressed
like
himself
on
the
other
rock
as
he
had
approached
to
succour
him
'na
na'
came
the
answer
'there
is
nae
sic
another
fule
in
these
parts
nor
has
there
been
since
the
time
o'
jamie
fleeman--him
that
was
fule
to
the
laird
o'
udny
why
mon
sic
a
heathenish
dress
as
ye
have
on
till
ye
has
nae
been
seen
in
these
pairts
within
the
memory
o'
mon
an'
i'm
thinkin'
that
sic
a
dress
never
was
for
sittin'
on
the
cauld
rock
as
ye
done
beyont
mon
but
do
ye
no
fear
the
rheumatism
or
the
lumbagy
wi'
floppin'
doon
on
to

cauld

i
was
thinking
that
it
was

i

mornin'
doon
be
the
port
but
it's
fule
or
eediot
ye
maun

thot'
mr
markam
did
not
care
to
argue
the
point
and
as
they
were
now
close
to
his
own
home
he
asked
the
salmon-fisher
to
have
a
glass
of
whisky--which
he
did--and
they
parted
for
the
night
he
took
good
care
to
warn
all
his
family
of
the
quicksand
telling
them
that
he
had
himself
been
in
some
danger
from
it
all
that
night
he
never
slept
he
heard
the
hours
strike
one
after
the
other
but
try
how
he
would
he
could
not
get
to
sleep
over
and
over
again
he
went
through
the
horrible
episode
of
the
quicksand
from
the
time
that
saft
tammie
had
broken
his
habitual
silence
to
preach
to
him
of
the
sin
of
vanity
and
to
warn
him
the
question
kept
ever
arising
in
his
mind
'am
i
then
so
vain
as
to
be
in
the
ranks
of
the
foolish'
and
the
answer
ever
came
in
the
words
of
the
crazy
prophet
'vanity
of
vanities
all
is
vanity
meet
thyself
face
to
face
and
repent
ere
the
quicksand
shall
swallow
thee'
somehow
a
feeling
of
doom
began
to
shape
itself
in
his
mind
that
he
would
yet
perish
in
that
same
quicksand
for
there
he
had
already
met
himself
face
to
face
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
he
dozed
off
but
it
was
evident
that
he
continued
the
subject
in
his
dreams
for
he
was
fully
awakened
by
his
wife
who
said
'do
sleep
quietly
that
blessed
highland
suit
has
got
on
your
brain
don't
talk
in
your
sleep
if
you
can
help
it'
he
was
somehow
conscious
of
a
glad
feeling
as
if
some
terrible
weight
had
been
lifted
from
him
but
he
did
not
know
any
cause
of
it
he
asked
his
wife
what
he
had
said
in
his
sleep
and
she
answered
'you
said
it
often
enough
goodness
knows
for
one
to
remember
it--not
face
to
face
i
saw
the
eagle
plume
over
the
bald
head
there
is
hope
yet
not
face
to
face
go
to
sleep
do'
and
then
he
did
go
to
sleep
for
he
seemed
to
realise
that
the
prophecy
of
the
crazy
man
had
not
yet
been
fulfilled
he
had
not
met
himself
face
to
face--as
yet
at
all
events
he
was
awakened
early
by
a
maid
who
came
to
tell
him
that
there
was
a
fisherman
at
the
door
who
wanted
to
see
him
he
dressed
himself
as
quickly
as
he
could--for
he
was
not
yet
expert
with
the
highland
dress--and
hurried
down
not
wishing
to
keep
the
salmon-fisher
waiting
he
was
surprised
and
not
altogether
pleased
to
find
that
his
visitor
was
none
other
than
saft
tammie
who
at
once
opened
fire
on
him
'i
maun
gang
awa'
t'
the
post
but
i
thocht
that
i
would
waste
an
hour
on
ye
and
ca'
roond
just
to
see
if
ye
waur
still
that
fou
wi'
vanity
as
on
the
nicht
gane
by
an
i
see
that
ye've
no
learned
the
lesson
well
the
time
is
comin'
sure
eneucht
however
i
have
all
the
time
i'
the
marnins
to
my
ain
sel'
so
i'll
aye
look
roond
jist
till
see
how
ye
gang
yer
ain
gait
to
the
quicksan'
and
then
to
the
de'il
i'm
aff
till
ma
wark
the
noo'
and
he
went
straightway
leaving
mr
markam
considerably
vexed
for
the
maids
within
earshot
were
vainly
trying
to
conceal
their
giggles
he
had
fairly
made
up
his
mind
to
wear
on
that
day
ordinary
clothes
but
the
visit
of
saft
tammie
reversed
his
decision
he
would
show
them
all
that
he
was
not
a
coward
and
he
would
go
on
as
he
had
begun--come
what
might
when
he
came
to
breakfast
in
full
martial
panoply
the
children
one
and
all
held
down
their
heads
and
the
backs
of
their
necks
became
very
red
indeed
as
however
none
of
them
laughed--except
titus
the
youngest
boy
who
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
hysterical
choking
and
was
promptly
banished
from
the
room--he
could
not
reprove
them
but
began
to
break
his
egg
with
a
sternly
determined
air
it
was
unfortunate
that
as
his
wife
was
handing
him
a
cup
of
tea
one
of
the
buttons
of
his
sleeve
caught
in
the
lace
of
her
morning
wrapper
with
the
result
that
the
hot
tea
was
spilt
over
his
bare
knees
not
unnaturally
he
made
use
of
a
swear
word
whereupon
his
wife
somewhat
nettled
spoke
out
'well
arthur
if
you
will
make
such
an
idiot
of
yourself
with
that
ridiculous
costume
what
else
can
you
expect
you
are
not
accustomed
to
it--and
you
never
will
be'
in
answer
he
began
an
indignant
speech
with
'madam'
but
he
got
no
further
for
now
that
the
subject
was
broached
mrs
markam
intended
to
have
her
say
out
it
was
not
a
pleasant
say
and
truth
to
tell
it
was
not
said
in
a
pleasant
manner
a
wife's
manner
seldom
is
pleasant
when
she
undertakes
to
tell
what
she
considers
'truths'
to
her
husband
the
result
was
that
arthur
fernlee
markam
undertook
then
and
there
that
during
his
stay
in
scotland
he
would
wear
no
other
costume
than
the
one
she
abused
woman-like
his
wife
had
the
last
word--given
in
this
case
with
tears
'very
well
arthur
of
course
you
will
do
as
you
choose
make
me
as
ridiculous
as
you
can
and
spoil
the
poor
girls'
chances
in
life
young
men
don't
seem
to
care
as
a
general
rule
for
an
idiot
father-in-law
but
i
must
warn
you
that
your
vanity
will
some
day
get
a
rude
shock--if
indeed
you
are
not
before
then
in
an
asylum
or
dead'
it
was
manifest
after
a
few
days
that
mr
markam
would
have
to
take
the
major
part
of
his
outdoor
exercise
by
himself
the
girls
now
and
again
took
a
walk
with
him
chiefly
in
the
early
morning
or
late
at
night
or
on
a
wet
day
when
there
would
be
no
one
about
they
professed
to
be
willing
to
go
out
at
all
times
but
somehow
something
always
seemed
to
occur
to
prevent
it
the
boys
could
never
be
found
at
all
on
such
occasions
and
as
to
mrs
markam
she
sternly
refused
to
go
out
with
him
on
any
consideration
so
long
as
he
should
continue
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
on
the
sunday
he
dressed
himself
in
his
habitual
broadcloth
for
he
rightly
felt
that
church
was
not
a
place
for
angry
feelings
but
on
monday
morning
he
resumed
his
highland
garb
by
this
time
he
would
have
given
a
good
deal
if
he
had
never
thought
of
the
dress
but
his
british
obstinacy
was
strong
and
he
would
not
give
in
saft
tammie
called
at
his
house
every
morning
and
not
being
able
to
see
him
nor
to
have
any
message
taken
to
him
used
to
call
back
in
the
afternoon
when
the
letter-bag
had
been
delivered
and
watched
for
his
going
out
on
such
occasions
he
never
failed
to
warn
him
against
his
vanity
in
the
same
words
which
he
had
used
at
the
first
before
many
days
were
over
mr
markam
had
come
to
look
upon
him
as
little
short
of
a
scourge
by
the
time
the
week
was
out
the
enforced
partial
solitude
the
constant
chagrin
and
the
never-ending
brooding
which
was
thus
engendered
began
to
make
mr
markam
quite
ill
he
was
too
proud
to
take
any
of
his
family
into
his
confidence
since
they
had
in
his
view
treated
him
very
badly
then
he
did
not
sleep
well
at
night
and
when
he
did
sleep
he
had
constantly
bad
dreams
merely
to
assure
himself
that
his
pluck
was
not
failing
him
he
made
it
a
practice
to
visit
the
quicksand
at
least
once
every
day
he
hardly
ever
failed
to
go
there
the
last
thing
at
night
it
was
perhaps
this
habit
that
wrought
the
quicksand
with
its
terrible
experience
so
perpetually
into
his
dreams
more
and
more
vivid
these
became
till
on
waking
at
times
he
could
hardly
realise
that
he
had
not
been
actually
in
the
flesh
to
visit
the
fatal
spot
he
sometimes
thought
that
he
might
have
been
walking
in
his
sleep
one
night
his
dream
was
so
vivid
that
when
he
awoke
he
could
not
believe
that
it
had
only
been
a
dream
he
shut
his
eyes
again
and
again
but
each
time
the
vision
if
it
was
a
vision
or
the
reality
if
it
was
a
reality
would
rise
before
him
the
moon
was
shining
full
and
yellow
over
the
quicksand
as
he
approached
it
he
could
see
the
expanse
of
light
shaken
and
disturbed
and
full
of
black
shadows
as
the
liquid
sand
quivered
and
trembled
and
wrinkled
and
eddied
as
was
its
wont
between
its
pauses
of
marble
calm
as
he
drew
close
to
it
another
figure
came
towards
it
from
the
opposite
side
with
equal
footsteps
he
saw
that
it
was
his
own
figure
his
very
self
and
in
silent
terror
compelled
by
what
force
he
knew
not
he
advanced--charmed
as
the
bird
is
by
the
snake
mesmerised
or
hypnotised--to
meet
this
other
self
as
he
felt
the
yielding
sand
closing
over
him
he
awoke
in
the
agony
of
death
trembling
with
fear
and
strange
to
say
with
the
silly
man's
prophecy
seeming
to
sound
in
his
ears
'vanity
of
vanities
all
is
vanity
see
thyself
and
repent
ere
the
quicksand
swallow
thee'
so
convinced
was
he
that
this
was
no
dream
that
he
arose
early
as
it
was
and
dressing
himself
without
disturbing
his
wife
took
his
way
to
the
shore
his
heart
fell
when
he
came
across
a
series
of
footsteps
on
the
sands
which
he
at
once
recognised
as
his
own
there
was
the
same
wide
heel
the
same
square
toe
he
had
no
doubt
now
that
he
had
actually
been
there
and
half
horrified
and
half
in
a
state
of
dreamy
stupor
he
followed
the
footsteps
and
found
them
lost
in
the
edge
of
the
yielding
quicksand
this
gave
him
a
terrible
shock
for
there
were
no
return
steps
marked
on
the
sand
and
he
felt
that
there
was
some
dread
mystery
which
he
could
not
penetrate
and
the
penetration
of
which
would
he
feared
undo
him
in
this
state
of
affairs
he
took
two
wrong
courses
firstly
he
kept
his
trouble
to
himself
and
as
none
of
his
family
had
any
clue
to
it
every
innocent
word
or
expression
which
they
used
supplied
fuel
to
the
consuming
fire
of
his
imagination
secondly
he
began
to
read
books
professing
to
bear
upon
the
mysteries
of
dreaming
and
of
mental
phenomena
generally
with
the
result
that
every
wild
imagination
of
every
crank
or
half-crazy
philosopher
became
a
living
germ
of
unrest
in
the
fertilising
soil
of
his
disordered
brain
thus
negatively
and
positively
all
things
began
to
work
to
a
common
end
not
the
least
of
his
disturbing
causes
was
saft
tammie
who
had
now
become
at
certain
times
of
the
day
a
fixture
at
his
gate
after
a
while
being
interested
in
the
previous
state
of
this
individual
he
made
inquiries
regarding
his
past
with
the
following
result
saft
tammie
was
popularly
believed
to
be
the
son
of
a
laird
in
one
of
the
counties
round
the
firth
of
forth
he
had
been
partially
educated
for
the
ministry
but
for
some
cause
which
no
one
ever
knew
threw
up
his
prospects
suddenly
and
going
to
peterhead
in
its
days
of
whaling
prosperity
had
there
taken
service
on
a
whaler
here
off
and
on
he
had
remained
for
some
years
getting
gradually
more
and
more
silent
in
his
habits
till
finally
his
shipmates
protested
against
so
taciturn
a
mate
and
he
had
found
service
amongst
the
fishing
smacks
of
the
northern
fleet
he
had
worked
for
many
years
at
the
fishing
with
always
the
reputation
of
being
'a
wee
bit
daft'
till
at
length
he
had
gradually
settled
down
at
crooken
where
the
laird
doubtless
knowing
something
of
his
family
history
had
given
him
a
job
which
practically
made
him
a
pensioner
the
minister
who
gave
the
information
finished
thus--
'it
is
a
very
strange
thing
but
the
man
seems
to
have
some
odd
kind
of
gift
whether
it
be
that
second
sight
which
we
scotch
people
are
so
prone
to
believe
in
or
some
other
occult
form
of
knowledge
i
know
not
but
nothing
of
a
disastrous
tendency
ever
occurs
in
this
place
but
the
men
with
whom
he
lives
are
able
to
quote
after
the
event
some
saying
of
his
which
certainly
appears
to
have
foretold
it
he
gets
uneasy
or
excited--wakes
up
in
fact--when
death
is
in
the
air'
this
did
not
in
any
way
tend
to
lessen
mr
markam's
concern
but
on
the
contrary
seemed
to
impress
the
prophecy
more
deeply
on
his
mind
of
all
the
books
which
he
had
read
on
his
new
subject
of
study
none
interested
him
so
much
as
a
german
one
die
dã¶ppleganger
by
dr
heinrich
von
aschenberg
formerly
of
bonn
here
he
learned
for
the
first
time
of
cases
where
men
had
led
a
double
existence--each
nature
being
quite
apart
from
the
other--the
body
being
always
a
reality
with
one
spirit
and
a
simulacrum
with
the
other
needless
to
say
that
mr
markam
realised
this
theory
as
exactly
suiting
his
own
case
the
glimpse
which
he
had
of
his
own
back
the
night
of
his
escape
from
the
quicksand--his
own
footmarks
disappearing
into
the
quicksand
with
no
return
steps
visible--the
prophecy
of
saft
tammie
about
his
meeting
himself
and
perishing
in
the
quicksand--all
lent
aid
to
the
conviction
that
he
was
in
his
own
person
an
instance
of
the
dã¶ppleganger
being
then
conscious
of
a
double
life
he
took
steps
to
prove
its
existence
to
his
own
satisfaction
to
this
end
on
one
night
before
going
to
bed
he
wrote
his
name
in
chalk
on
the
soles
of
his
shoes
that
night
he
dreamed
of
the
quicksand
and
of
his
visiting
it--dreamed
so
vividly
that
on
walking
in
the
grey
of
the
dawn
he
could
not
believe
that
he
had
not
been
there
arising
without
disturbing
his
wife
he
sought
his
shoes
the
chalk
signatures
were
undisturbed
he
dressed
himself
and
stole
out
softly
this
time
the
tide
was
in
so
he
crossed
the
dunes
and
struck
the
shore
on
the
further
side
of
the
quicksand
there
oh
horror
of
horrors
he
saw
his
own
footprints
dying
into
the
abyss
he
went
home
a
desperately
sad
man
it
seemed
incredible
that
he
an
elderly
commercial
man
who
had
passed
a
long
and
uneventful
life
in
the
pursuit
of
business
in
the
midst
of
roaring
practical
london
should
thus
find
himself
enmeshed
in
mystery
and
horror
and
that
he
should
discover
that
he
had
two
existences
he
could
not
speak
of
his
trouble
even
to
his
own
wife
for
well
he
knew
that
she
would
at
once
require
the
fullest
particulars
of
that
other
life--the
one
which
she
did
not
know
and
that
she
would
at
the
start
not
only
imagine
but
charge
him
with
all
manner
of
infidelities
on
the
head
of
it
and
so
his
brooding
grew
deeper
and
deeper
still
one
evening--the
tide
then
going
out
and
the
moon
being
at
the
full--he
was
sitting
waiting
for
dinner
when
the
maid
announced
that
saft
tammie
was
making
a
disturbance
outside
because
he
would
not
be
let
in
to
see
him
he
was
very
indignant
but
did
not
like
the
maid
to
think
that
he
had
any
fear
on
the
subject
and
so
told
her
to
bring
him
in
tammie
entered
walking
more
briskly
than
ever
with
his
head
up
and
a
look
of
vigorous
decision
in
the
eyes
that
were
so
generally
cast
down
as
soon
as
he
entered
he
said
'i
have
come
to
see
ye
once
again--once
again
and
there
ye
sit
still
just
like
a
cockatoo
on
a
pairch
weel
mon
i
forgie
ye
mind
ye
that
i
forgie
ye'
and
without
a
word
more
he
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
house
leaving
the
master
in
speechless
indignation
after
dinner
he
determined
to
pay
another
visit
to
the
quicksand--he
would
not
allow
even
to
himself
that
he
was
afraid
to
go
and
so
about
nine
o'clock
in
full
array
he
marched
to
the
beach
and
passing
over
the
sands
sat
on
the
skirt
of
the
nearer
rock
the
full
moon
was
behind
him
and
its
light
lit
up
the
bay
so
that
its
fringe
of
foam
the
dark
outline
of
the
headland
and
the
stakes
of
the
salmon-nets
were
all
emphasised
in
the
brilliant
yellow
glow
the
lights
in
the
windows
of
port
crooken
and
in
those
of
the
distant
castle
of
the
laird
trembled
like
stars
through
the
sky
for
a
long
time
he
sat
and
drank
in
the
beauty
of
the
scene
and
his
soul
seemed
to
feel
a
peace
that
it
had
not
known
for
many
days
all
the
pettiness
and
annoyance
and
silly
fears
of
the
past
weeks
seemed
blotted
out
and
a
new
holy
calm
took
the
vacant
place
in
this
sweet
and
solemn
mood
he
reviewed
his
late
action
calmly
and
felt
ashamed
of
himself
for
his
vanity
and
for
the
obstinacy
which
had
followed
it
and
then
and
there
he
made
up
his
mind
that
the
present
would
be
the
last
time
he
would
wear
the
costume
which
had
estranged
him
from
those
whom
he
loved
and
which
had
caused
him
so
many
hours
and
days
of
chagrin
vexation
and
pain
but
almost
as
soon
as
he
arrived
at
this
conclusion
another
voice
seemed
to
speak
within
him
and
mockingly
to
ask
him
if
he
should
ever
get
the
chance
to
wear
the
suit
again--that
it
was
too
late--he
had
chosen
his
course
and
must
now
abide
the
issue
'it
is
not
too
late'
came
the
quick
answer
of
his
better
self
and
full
of
the
thought
he
rose
up
to
go
home
and
divest
himself
of
the
now
hateful
costume
right
away
he
paused
for
one
look
at
the
beautiful
scene
the
light
lay
pale
and
mellow
softening
every
outline
of
rock
and
tree
and
house-top
and
deepening
the
shadows
into
velvety-black
and
lighting
as
with
a
pale
flame
the
incoming
tide
that
now
crept
fringe-like
across
the
flat
waste
of
sand
then
he
left
the
rock
and
stepped
out
for
the
shore
but
as
he
did
so
a
frightful
spasm
of
horror
shook
him
and
for
an
instant
the
blood
rushing
to
his
head
shut
out
all
the
light
of
the
full
moon
once
more
he
saw
that
fatal
image
of
himself
moving
beyond
the
quicksand
from
the
opposite
rock
to
the
shore
the
shock
was
all
the
greater
for
the
contrast
with
the
spell
of
peace
which
he
had
just
enjoyed
and
almost
paralysed
in
every
sense
he
stood
and
watched
the
fatal
vision
and
the
wrinkly
crawling
quicksand
that
seemed
to
writhe
and
yearn
for
something
that
lay
between
there
could
be
no
mistake
this
time
for
though
the
moon
behind
threw
the
face
into
shadow
he
could
see
there
the
same
shaven
cheeks
as
his
own
and
the
small
stubby
moustache
of
a
few
weeks'
growth
the
light
shone
on
the
brilliant
tartan
and
on
the
eagle's
plume
even
the
bald
space
at
one
side
of
the
glengarry
cap
glistened
as
did
the
cairngorm
brooch
on
the
shoulder
and
the
tops
of
the
silver
buttons
as
he
looked
he
felt
his
feet
slightly
sinking
for
he
was
still
near
the
edge
of
the
belt
of
quicksand
and
he
stepped
back
as
he
did
so
the
other
figure
stepped
forward
so
that
the
space
between
them
was
preserved
so
the
two
stood
facing
each
other
as
though
in
some
weird
fascination
and
in
the
rushing
of
the
blood
through
his
brain
markam
seemed
to
hear
the
words
of
the
prophecy
'see
thyself
face
to
face
and
repent
ere
the
quicksand
swallow
thee'
he
did
stand
face
to
face
with
himself
he
had
repented--and
now
he
was
sinking
in
the
quicksand
the
warning
and
prophecy
were
coming
true
above
him
the
seagulls
screamed
circling
round
the
fringe
of
the
incoming
tide
and
the
sound
being
entirely
mortal
recalled
him
to
himself
on
the
instant
he
stepped
back
a
few
quick
steps
for
as
yet
only
his
feet
were
merged
in
the
soft
sand
as
he
did
so
the
other
figure
stepped
forward
and
coming
within
the
deadly
grip
of
the
quicksand
began
to
sink
it
seemed
to
markam
that
he
was
looking
at
himself
going
down
to
his
doom
and
on
the
instant
the
anguish
of
his
soul
found
vent
in
a
terrible
cry
there
was
at
the
same
instant
a
terrible
cry
from
the
other
figure
and
as
markam
threw
up
his
hands
the
figure
did
the
same
with
horror-struck
eyes
he
saw
him
sink
deeper
into
the
quicksand
and
then
impelled
by
what
power
he
knew
not
he
advanced
again
towards
the
sand
to
meet
his
fate
but
as
his
more
forward
foot
began
to
sink
he
heard
again
the
cries
of
the
seagulls
which
seemed
to
restore
his
benumbed
faculties
with
a
mighty
effort
he
drew
his
foot
out
of
the
sand
which
seemed
to
clutch
it
leaving
his
shoe
behind
and
then
in
sheer
terror
he
turned
and
ran
from
the
place
never
stopping
till
his
breath
and
strength
failed
him
and
he
sank
half
swooning
on
the
grassy
path
through
the
sandhills





arthur
markam
made
up
his
mind
not
to
tell
his
family
of
his
terrible
adventure--until
at
least
such
time
as
he
should
be
complete
master
of
himself
now
that
the
fatal
double--his
other
self--had
been
engulfed
in
the
quicksand
he
felt
something
like
his
old
peace
of
mind
that
night
he
slept
soundly
and
did
not
dream
at
all
and
in
the
morning
was
quite
his
old
self
it
really
seemed
as
though
his
newer
and
worser
self
had
disappeared
for
ever
and
strangely
enough
saft
tammie
was
absent
from
his
post
that
morning
and
never
appeared
there
again
but
sat
in
his
old
place
watching
nothing
as
of
old
with
lack-lustre
eye
in
accordance
with
his
resolution
he
did
not
wear
his
highland
suit
again
but
one
evening
tied
it
up
in
a
bundle
claymore
dirk
and
philibeg
and
all
and
bringing
it
secretly
with
him
threw
it
into
the
quicksand
with
a
feeling
of
intense
pleasure
he
saw
it
sucked
below
the
sand
which
closed
above
it
into
marble
smoothness
then
he
went
home
and
announced
cheerily
to
his
family
assembled
for
evening
prayers
'well
my
dears
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
have
abandoned
my
idea
of
wearing
the
highland
dress
i
see
now
what
a
vain
old
fool
i
was
and
how
ridiculous
i
made
myself
you
shall
never
see
it
again'
'where
is
it
father'
asked
one
of
the
girls
wishing
to
say
something
so
that
such
a
self-sacrificing
announcement
as
her
father's
should
not
be
passed
in
absolute
silence
his
answer
was
so
sweetly
given
that
the
girl
rose
from
her
seat
and
came
and
kissed
him
it
was
'in
the
quicksand
my
dear
and
i
hope
that
my
worser
self
is
buried
there
along
with
it--for
ever'





the
remainder
of
the
summer
was
passed
at
crooken
with
delight
by
all
the
family
and
on
his
return
to
town
mr
markam
had
almost
forgotten
the
whole
of
the
incident
of
the
quicksand
and
all
touching
on
it
when
one
day
he
got
a
letter
from
the
maccallum
more
which
caused
him
much
thought
though
he
said
nothing
of
it
to
his
family
and
left
it
for
certain
reasons
unanswered
it
ran
as
follows--

'dear
sir--i
trust
you
will
pardon
the
liberty
which
i
take
in
writing
to
you
but
i
am
desirous
of
making
an
inquiry
and
i
am
informed
that
you
have
been
sojourning
during
the
summer
in
aberdeenshire
scotland
nb
my
partner
mr
roderick
macdhu--as
he
appears
for
business
reasons
on
our
bill-heads
and
in
our
advertisements
his
real
name
being
emmanuel
moses
marks
of
london--went
early
last
month
to
scotland
nb
for
a
tour
but
as
i
have
only
once
heard
from
him
shortly
after
his
departure
i
am
anxious
lest
any
misfortune
may
have
befallen
him
as
i
have
been
unable
to
obtain
any
news
of
him
on
making
all
inquiries
in
my
power
i
venture
to
appeal
to
you
his
letter
was
written
in
deep
dejection
of
spirit
and
mentioned
that
he
feared
a
judgment
had
come
upon
him
for
wishing
to
appear
as
a
scotchman
on
scottish
soil
as
he
had
one
moonlight
night
shortly
after
his
arrival
seen
his
'wraith'
he
evidently
alluded
to
the
fact
that
before
his
departure
he
had
procured
for
himself
a
highland
costume
similar
to
that
which
we
had
the
honour
to
supply
to
you
with
which
as
perhaps
you
will
remember
he
was
much
struck
he
may
however
never
have
worn
it
as
he
was
to
my
own
knowledge
diffident
about
putting
it
on
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
tell
me
that
he
would
at
first
only
venture
to
wear
it
late
at
night
or
very
early
in
the
morning
and
then
only
in
remote
places
until
such
time
as
he
should
get
accustomed
to
it
unfortunately
he
did
not
advise
me
of
his
route
so
that
i
am
in
complete
ignorance
of
his
whereabouts
and
i
venture
to
ask
if
you
may
have
seen
or
heard
of
a
highland
costume
similar
to
your
own
having
been
seen
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
in
which
i
am
told
you
have
recently
purchased
the
estate
which
you
temporarily
occupied
i
shall
not
expect
an
answer
to
this
letter
unless
you
can
give
me
some
information
regarding
my
friend
and
partner
so
pray
do
not
trouble
to
reply
unless
there
be
cause
i
am
encouraged
to
think
that
he
may
have
been
in
your
neighbourhood
as
though
his
letter
is
not
dated
the
envelope
is
marked
with
the
postmark
of
yellon
which
i
find
is
in
aberdeenshire
and
not
far
from
the
mains
of
crooken
