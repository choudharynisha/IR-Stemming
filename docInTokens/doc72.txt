fred
trent
pulled
his
coupe
into
the
curb
and
leaned
his
head
out
the
open
window
beside
him
hi
joan
need
any
help
he
called
to
a
trim-looking
girl
in
a
nurse's
uniform
joan
drake
was
holding
on
to
a
leash
with
both
hands
and
her
slender
body
was
tugging
against
the
leash
as
she
strained
against
the
pull
of
a
great
dane
on
the
other
end
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
as
trent
called
out
her
blonde
hair
glinting
in
the
warm
afternoon
sunlight
blue
eyes
smiled
an
impish
greeting
at
him
hello
fred
no
thanks
brutus
and
i
get
along
famously
trent
opened
the
car
door
and
got
out
he
walked
up
the
sidewalk
and
stood
beside
the
girl
illustration
they
watched
as
white-hot
flames
shot
from
the
base
of
the
cradled
rocket
there
was
a
tremendous
roaring
and
then
the
rocket
slowly
lifted
upward
business
must
be
mighty
slack
for
the
great
gland
specialist
stanley
fenwick
is
this
all
he
can
find
for
his
pretty
nurse
to
do
the
girl
sniffed
walking
brutus
around
has
its
compensations
at
least
he
doesn't
get
fresh--like
some
people
i
know
fred
grinned
as
he
saw
the
huge
dog
suddenly
turn
on
its
leash
and
raise
itself
off
the
ground
to
stick
out
a
long
rapier-like
tongue
and
lick
the
girl's
cheek
before
she
could
move
her
head
away
down
brutus
down
she
called
out
half-laughing
trent
stepped
in
and
pulled
the
big
animal
away
from
the
girl
patting
the
dog's
head
as
he
did
so
what
was
that
you
said
about
getting
fresh
trent
asked
her
looks
to
me
like
the
dog's
life
is
the
best
around
the
fenwick
offices
just
don't
get
any
ideas
joan
drake
shot
back
i've
already
got
them
he
replied
which
reminds
me
am
i
seeing
you
tonight
the
girl
held
a
tight
grip
on
the
leash
and
looked
at
him
coyly
let's
see
we'll
take
in
a
movie
stop
for
a
bite
to
eat
at
joe's
hamburger
palace
and
then
drive
out
to
north
butte
you'll
park
the
car
and
then
you'll
ask
me
when
i'm
going
to
quit
my
job
and
settle
down
raising
a
family
for
you
and
i'll
say--
you'll
say
not
until
i
get
the
biggest
scoop
in
arizona
a
big
raise
and
a
bonus
as
a
down
payment
on
a
house
he
completed
her
sentence
there
you
see
we
might
just
as
well
not
have
our
date
in
effect
we've
had
it
already
he
looked
at
her
for
a
long
moment
and
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
had
lost
its
humorous
note
you
forgot
one
very
important
item
when
i
ask
you
that
usual
question
and
after
you
give
your
usual
answer
i'll
take
you
in
my
arms
and
tell
you
how
much
you
mean
to
me
and--
you
win
she
interrupted
him
i
had
forgotten
about
that





the
dog
started
to
pull
against
the
leash
again
and
fred
reached
out
to
help
her
hold
the
big
animal
in
check
then
she
looked
at
him
again
what
brings
you
to
the
outskirts
of
tucson
don't
tell
me
there's
a
big
story
breaking
on
the
edge
of
town
he
shook
his
head
not
exactly
i'm
on
my
way
to
the
rocket
research
proving
grounds
just
a
routine
story
on
the
experiment
they're
going
to
pull
off
this
evening
i've
got
to
interview
mathieson
gaddon
and
a
few
other
scientists
on
the
project
the
girl
laughed
that's
something
of
a
coincidence
dr
blair
gaddon
is
in
dr
fenwick's
office
right
now
fred
trent's
eyebrows
raised
in
surprise
that
so
something
wrong
with
him
no
he's
just
having
a
physical
checkup
seems
to
be
worried
about
his
heart
dr
fenwick
didn't
need
me
since
it's
a
routine
job
so
i
took
brutus
for
a
walk
trent
nodded
that's
a
bit
of
luck
i
think
i'll
stick
around
and
give
gaddon
a
lift
out
to
the
proving
grounds
i
wanted
to
talk
to
him
anyway
in
that
case
the
girl
replied
you
can
give
me
a
hand
putting
brutus
back
in
his
kennel
once
he
gets
out
he's
something
of
a
problem
fred
nodded
taking
the
leash
from
her
hands
and
feeling
the
big
dog
tug
against
him
never
could
figure
out
why
fenwick
wanted
a
big
hound
like
this
seems
to
me
a
terrier
would
be
more
practical
that's
a
matter
of
taste
joan
answered
dr
fenwick
is
very
fond
of
brutus--and
so
am
i
for
that
matter
but
tell
me
something
about
this
experiment
you're
covering
they
had
turned
in
at
a
large
spanish
type
house
that
trent
knew
served
as
a
combination
living
quarters
and
office
for
the
famous
gland
specialist
he
shrugged
don't
know
much
about
it
myself
they're
shooting
off
this
new
type
rocket
a
really
big
affair
loaded
with
all
sorts
of
instruments
some
sort
of
experiment
with
cosmic
rays
the
rocket
will
go
up
to
the
outer
layers
of
the
earth's
atmosphere
where
a
clocked
mechanism
will
release
a
parachute-attached
section
containing
the
instruments
this
will
float
back
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
there
is
one
interesting
thing
about
it
though
they're
also
including
a
live
animal
with
the
instruments
a
cat
i
believe
they
want
to
see
what
effect
the
cosmic
rays
will
have
on
a
living
creature
the
girl
turned
a
shocked
face
toward
him
as
they
walked
up
the
steps
to
the
front
door
of
the
house
trent
could
see
a
panel
in
the
center
of
the
door
that
opened
from
the
inside
and
over
it
the
sign
doctor
is
in
please
ring
but
i
think
that's
positively
cruel
joan
drake
said
earnestly
subjecting
an
innocent
animal
to
what
may
be
certain
death
fred
laughed
at
her
concern
hold
on
now
you
should
be
the
last
one
to
take
such
an
attitude
doesn't
medical
science
experiment
on
animals
to
find
out
about
human
ailments
that's
different
the
girl
insisted
opening
the
door
and
leading
the
way
into
a
long
hall
doctors
know
what
they
are
doing--but
this
is
a
sheer
waste
of
life






trent
let
the
dog
pull
him
down
the
hall
toward
a
door
at
the
end
which
he
knew
opened
on
the
backyard
where
the
great
dane
was
kept
seems
to
me
it's
much
the
same
thing
he
answered
her
scientists
want
to
explore
the
mysteries
of
space
and
the
only
way
to
do
it
is
with
an
animal
or
would
you
like
to
make
the
trip--maybe
i
can
arrange
it
would
make
a
big
story
just
the
one
i've
been
waiting
for
i
believe
you
would
at
that
she
mocked
opening
the
rear
door
here
give
me
the
leash
trent
handed
over
the
leash
to
her
and
watched
as
she
released
the
huge
dog
brutus
flicked
out
a
long
tongue
once
again
and
caught
the
girl's
cheek
in
a
wet
caress
before
she
straightened
brutus
now
get
along
with
you
the
dog
took
a
leisurely
bound
through
the
door
and
into
the
backyard
trent
glanced
through
the
door
at
the
tall
fenced-in
yard
with
the
large
kennel
that
might
well
have
served
as
a
small
garage
he
stood
beside
the
girl
watching
the
big
animal
romp
for
a
few
moments
then
she
shut
the
door
and
they
turned
back
down
the
hall
i'll
have
to
go
inside
now
fred
she
said
if
you
want
to
wait
for
gaddon
have
a
seat
it
shouldn't
be
long
she
started
to
turn
in
at
a
door
marked
private
when
fred
pulled
her
gently
around
and
before
she
could
stop
him
had
kissed
her
i
was
getting
mighty
jealous
of
brutus
now
i
feel
better
i
don't
know
which
of
you
i
prefer
she
shot
back
then
smiled
and
pulled
away
from
him
he
watched
her
open
the
office
door
and
close
it
after
her





he
had
lit
his
second
cigarette
and
gotten
halfway
through
his
third
magazine
on
the
rack
beside
the
chair
when
the
office
door
opened
again
he
heard
the
pleasant
voice
of
dr
stanley
fenwick
if
every
man
had
a
heart
as
strong
as
yours
blair
we
wouldn't
need
half
the
doctors
we
have
then
he
heard
the
deep
gruff
voice
of
dr
blair
gaddon
half
laugh
thanks
a
lot
fenwick
you've
taken
a
load
off
my
mind
goodbye
miss
drake
he
heard
joan
reply
and
then
saw
dr
fenwick
usher
the
physicist
out
into
the
hall
trent
rose
as
the
two
men
approached
why
hello
trent
dr
fenwick
said
trent
nodded
at
the
tall
white-coated
figure
of
the
famous
gland
specialist
afternoon
doctor
fenwick
smiled
at
him
don't
tell
me
you're
waiting
to
see
me
fred
shook
his
head
not
exactly
i
was
waiting
to
see
dr
gaddon
though
i
was
on
my
way
out
to
the
proving
grounds
and
i
happened
to
stop
by
and
talk
to
miss
drake
he
turned
to
the
physicist
a
bulky
man
with
firm
hard
features
who
moved
his
large
body
with
an
almost
cat-like
grace
i
hope
you
don't
mind
dr
gaddon
possibly
i
can
give
you
a
lift
back
out
to
the
base
i'm
covering
the
launching
for
my
paper
gaddon
smiled
at
him
but
of
course
i
don't
mind
and
i'll
take
you
up
on
that
offer
it'll
save
me
a
trip
back
to
town
to
take
one
of
the
staff
cars





the
words
had
a
friendly
note
to
them
as
did
the
smile
on
gaddon's
face
and
yet
somehow
fred
trent
found
that
he
did
not
like
this
man
it
was
nothing
he
could
put
his
finger
on
nothing
he
could
rationalize
unless
it
was
the
coldly
calculating
look
in
the
scientist's
eyes
that's
fine
doctor
trent
replied
shall
we
go
he
turned
and
said
good-bye
to
fenwick
and
passed
a
smiling
glance
at
the
girl
he
could
see
her
blush
slightly
as
fenwick
caught
the
glance
and
laughed
then
they
were
out
of
the
house
and
trent
led
the
way
to
his
car
inside
he
started
the
motor
and
drove
away
beside
him
gaddon
lit
a
cigar
and
blew
a
long
plume
of
smoke
through
the
open
window
you
said
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me
trent
fred
nodded
that's
right
doctor
i'm
writing
up
the
rocket
experiment
for
my
paper
and
i
thought
maybe
you
could
give
me
a
few
details
of
interest
he
paused
for
a
moment
then
asked
would
it
be
too
personal
to
ask
if
your
visit
to
dr
fenwick
had
anything
to
do
with
the
coming
experiment
gaddon
shot
a
quick
glance
at
him
why
do
you
ask
that
fred
trent
shrugged
it
was
just
a
thought
i
heard
dr
fenwick
talking
about
your
heart
but
you
look
pretty
healthy
to
me
so
i
thought
maybe
it
was
because
fenwick
is
a
gland
specialist
and
you
might
be
talking
to
him
about
examining
the
cat
after
the
rocket
returns

gaddon
laughed
roughly
a
mighty
clever
reasoning
trent
but
not
quite
correct
the
fact
is
i
was
seeing
the
doctor
for
personal
reasons
just
a
physical
checkup
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
rocket
experiment
or
the
effect
of
the
cosmic
rays
on
the
animal
we're
including
in
the
experiment
it
was
just
a
thought
doctor
trent
replied
as
he
moved
the
coupe
out
on
the
open
highway
away
from
tucson
and
toward
the
rocket
proving
grounds
on
the
desert
flats
in
the
distance
so
now
that
we've
disposed
of
that
what
else
would
you
like
to
know
gaddon
asked
him
a
peculiar
edge
to
his
voice
that
trent
did
not
miss
well
i
would
like
to
get
a
first
hand
bit
of
information
on
just
exactly
what
you
plan
to
prove
with
this
experiment
if
i'm
correct
dr
mathieson
the
head
of
the
project
contends
that
cosmic
rays
may
be
lethal
and
this
experiment
is
to
prove
his
point
the
physicist
snorted
it
is
no
secret
that
mathieson
and
myself
disagree
violently
on
that
subject
trent's
eyebrows
raised
is
that
so
i
wasn't
aware
of
it
gaddon
paused
seeing
that
his
words
had
slipped
out
too
freely
finally
he
said
what
i
meant
to
say
trent
is
that
up
until
now
it
has
not
been
a
public
issue
of
disagreement
and
i
would
prefer
to
have
it
remain
a
private
matter
until
after
the
experiment
i
see
trent
mused
you
have
my
word
that
i
won't
print
anything
you
say
without
your
permission
but
just
what
is
the
difference
of
opinion
between
you
and
mathieson
gaddon
took
a
long
pull
at
his
cigar
and
waited
a
few
moments
before
replying
it
was
apparent
to
trent
that
he
was
debating
continuing
the
subject
with
a
newspaperman
but
trent
had
gauged
the
man
correctly
there
was
a
flair
of
vanity
in
gaddon
that
dated
back
to
his
english
ancestry
trent
remembered
that
gaddon
quite
a
figure
in
english
scientific
circles
had
created
a
stir
when
he
had
come
over
to
the
united
states
to
assist
in
rocket
research
at
the
arizona
proving
grounds
it
seemed
that
gaddon
had
not
wanted
to
take
a
back
seat
to
the
famed
american
scientist
mathieson
it
had
made
a
few
gossip
columns
in
the
newspapers
before
washington
put
an
official
clamp
on
the
matter





now
as
trent
waited
for
the
englishman
to
reply
he
could
almost
sense
the
thoughts
that
were
going
through
gaddon's
mind
the
englishman
was
debating
whether
to
take
an
open
stand
against
the
viewpoints
of
his
american
colleague
but
trent
felt
that
the
british
stubbornness
in
the
man
would
make
him
reveal
his
own
theories
especially
since
trent
had
already
promised
not
to
print
anything
without
gaddon's
permission
that
would
give
him
an
opportunity
to
gloat
safely
should
his
own
ideas
be
proven
correct
very
well
trent
i'll
take
you
at
your
professional
word
to
keep
this
matter
confidential
but
if
what
i
contend
is
correct
you'll
have
a
big
story
to
tell
trent
waited
expectantly
not
wanting
to
break
the
englishman's
train
of
thought
the
fact
is
trent
that
mathieson
is
all
wrong
to
go
even
further
most
of
your
american
scientists
don't
have
the
haziest
idea
of
exactly
what
the
cosmic
rays
are
we
in
britain
have
made
quite
exhaustive
studies
of
the
phenomena
trent
didn't
bother
to
argue
with
him
he
only
nodded
his
head
it
would
have
been
silly
he
knew
to
contradict
gaddon
to
tell
him
that
the
english
didn't
know
a
thing
more
about
the
cosmic
rays
than
the
american
scientists
that
american
science
had
made
and
was
continually
making
exhaustive
research
into
that
scientific
field
of
study
on
as
great
if
not
more
so
a
scale
than
britain
could
possibly
achieve
it
was
only
gaddon's
vanity
talking
trent
knew
so
he
let
him
put
in
the
barb
of
ridicule
waiting
i
was
sent
over
here
as
you
may
know
to
aid
in
the
current
experiment
to
formulate
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
test
is
being
conducted
to
determine
just
what
effect
cosmic
rays
will
have
on
a
living
organism
as
i
said
mathieson
and
your
other
scientists
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
rays
are
lethal
that
they
will
destroy
life
in
effect
that
they
are
death
rays
but
i
contend
that
they
are
wrong
what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
that
cosmic
rays
are
the
very
source
of
life
and
energy
in
the
universe
trent
whistled
judiciously
and
noted
that
gaddon's
face
smiled
at
the
apparent
surprise
trent
evinced
you
find
that
a
startling
statement
trent
nodded
i'd
say
that
it
sounded
like
the
beginning
of
a
very
interesting
theory
and
you
would
be
right
gaddon
replied
warming
to
his
subject
it
is
my
contention
that
the
cosmic
rays
will
prove
to
be
the
fountain
of
youth
that
men
have
sought
through
the
ages
that
they
will
react
on
the
glands
of
a
living
creature
and
produce
immortality
now
take
your
choice
whose
theory
would
you
rather
believe
mathieson's
idiotic
claims
of
a
death
ray
or
mine
as
a
source
of
the
utmost
benefit
to
science
trent
took
a
moment
before
replying
when
he
did
so
he
spoke
with
tact
and
also
with
the
feeling
that
his
trip
to
fenwick's
office
had
proven
very
valuable
for
there
was
a
story
here
a
big
story
i'd
say
doctor
that
i'd
like
to
believe
your
theory
was
correct
but
isn't
it
a
little
premature
to
be
so
definite
about
it
gaddon
snorted
no
more
premature
than
mathieson's
and
i'll
tell
you
something
else
trent
you
may
not
realize
it
but
you're
about
to
take
part
in
what
may
be
the
biggest
story
of
the
century
and
when
it
breaks
you'll
remember
our
conversation
here
i
intend
to
prove
that
your
american
scientists
are
wrong
trent
noticed
the
personal
emphasis
that
gaddon
put
in
his
last
statement
but
he
was
drawn
away
from
the
conversation
as
he
turned
the
coupe
into
the
guarded
entrance
to
the
proving
grounds
there
was
a
moment
of
credential
flashing
to
the
guards
and
a
respectful
salute
to
the
scientist
in
the
car
beside
trent
then
trent
moved
his
coupe
through
the
entrance
and
up
the
cement
roadway
to
the
administration
building
as
gaddon
got
out
of
the
car
he
turned
to
trent
i'll
leave
you
here
the
members
of
the
press
will
be
conducted
to
the
launching
site
at
dusk
i'll
see
you
then
in
the
meantime
don't
forget
that
you've
given
your
word
not
to
release
any
of
the
information
i've
given
you
trent
nodded
and
watched
him
walk
away
he
followed
the
englishman
with
his
eyes
a
frown
crossing
his
face
there
was
something
too
cocksure
about
the
man
his
ridicule
of
american
scientists
could
be
ignored
but
the
way
he
spoke
about
his
theory
as
if
it
had
already
been
a
proven
fact
against
the
ideas
of
mathieson
a
faint
chill
ran
up
fred
trent's
back
he
couldn't
explain
it
but
it
was
there
an
ominous
note
of
foreboding
he
shrugged
it
off
and
left
his
car
to
walk
toward
the
administration
building





the
remaining
hours
of
the
afternoon
dragged
by
in
a
monotony
of
idle
speculation
trent
listened
to
the
gathered
newspapermen
discussing
the
coming
experiment
at
dusk
accompanied
them
as
dr
mathieson
the
head
of
the
project
conducted
them
on
a
tour
of
the
project
to
the
launching
site
and
then
back
to
the
central
building
the
launching
site
itself
had
been
an
impressive
sight
the
huge
rockets
much
in
appearance
like
the
famed
v2
of
world
war
ii
but
on
a
much
larger
scale
were
cradled
in
their
launching
platforms
like
some
huge
monsters
about
to
be
unleashed
into
the
unsuspecting
heavens
they
had
listened
as
mathieson
explained
the
various
number
of
instruments
that
were
being
included
in
the
first
rocket
to
record
its
hurtling
trip
through
the
atmosphere
to
the
outermost
layers
of
the
earth's
surface
and
they
had
been
told
of
the
other
and
to
the
gathered
newspapermen
the
most
interesting
part
the
inclusion
of
a
cat
in
the
rocket
in
a
large
oxygen-fed
chamber
to
study
the
effects
of
the
cosmic
rays
on
a
living
creature
then
back
to
the
central
building
back
to
wait
and
the
tension
began
to
mount
for
the
shadows
were
lengthening
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
horizon
to
the
west
the
moment
was
now
close
at
hand





a
stocky
figure
detached
itself
from
the
shadows
beside
the
huge
bulk
of
the
laboratory
building
and
slowly
edged
out
into
the
dusk
it
paused
momentarily
to
survey
the
scene
sharp
eyes
scanned
the
looming
rockets
and
their
launching
platforms
watchful
alert
they
finally
settled
upon
the
armed
guard
who
walked
a
measured
distance
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
rockets
then
the
figure
moved
forward
again
cautiously
purposefully
the
distance
from
the
giant
rockets
shortened
gradually
and
then
the
guard
turning
to
retrace
his
steps
saw
the
approaching
figure
there
was
a
snapping
sound
as
a
rifle
was
brought
into
position
and
a
rapping
command
barked
out
halt
who
goes
there
the
shadowy
figure
halted
abruptly
a
short
distance
away
from
the
guard
and
a
voice
answered
dr
blair
gaddon
the
guard's
rifle
snapped
into
present
arms
and
then
back
to
the
soldier's
right
shoulder
oh
it's
you
sir
is
there
anything
wrong
the
launching
is
set
for
fifteen
minutes
from
now
isn't
it
gaddon
walked
slowly
up
to
the
soldier
and
the
guard
could
then
see
his
face
in
the
thickening
shadows
that's
right
gaddon
replied
i'm
making
a
last
minute
inspection
the
guard
nodded
dr
mathieson
and
the
newspapermen
will
be
along
any
minute
sir
gaddon
moved
closer
to
the
soldier
and
then
suddenly
his
hand
came
out
of
his
coat
pocket
and
there
was
a
gun
in
it
drop
your
rifle
soldier
quick
the
guard
stared
at
the
scientist
in
shocked
astonishment
what
is
this
sir
a
gag
gaddon
motioned
with
his
gun
it
is
no
gag
do
as
i
say--or
must
i
shoot





there
was
an
ominous
note
in
gaddon's
voice
and
a
strained
quality
to
it
that
told
the
guard
the
man
meant
what
he
said
very
slowly
the
soldier
removed
the
rifle
from
his
shoulder
and
dropped
it
to
the
ground
gaddon
motioned
with
his
gun
now
step
back
move
the
guard
moved
slowly
back
a
pace
and
then
the
englishman
stepped
forward
and
kicked
the
rifle
away
from
the
man
then
he
motioned
around
the
rocket
now
move
over
around
the
side
of
the
number
one
rocket
to
the
far
side
of
number
two
he
watched
as
the
guard
turned
and
began
to
walk
slowly
around
the
huge
base
of
the
waiting
rocket
he
followed
the
soldier
i
don't
know
what
this
is
all
about
dr
gaddon
the
guard
protested
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
you're
playing
with
the
united
states
government
right
now
when
dr
mathieson
hears
about
this--
when
dr
mathieson
hears
about
this
soldier
i'll
be
a
long
way
from
here--out
at
the
edge
of
space
itself
gaddon
could
hear
the
guard
draw
in
his
breath
sharply
but
the
man
kept
walking
around
to
the
far
side
of
the
second
rocket
cradle
you
can't
mean
that
you're
going
to
go
up--
the
soldier's
voice
broke
off
uncertainly
and
gaddon
laughed
shortly
you
are
a
discerning
man
soldier
that
is
exactly
what
i
intend
to
do
and
i
warn
you
don't
make
a
false
move
or
i'll
shoot
my
plans
are
made
and
i
intend
to
carry
them
out
they
had
reached
the
far
side
of
the
second
rocket
now
away
from
view
of
the
rest
of
the
buildings
out
of
sight
away
in
the
distance
the
faint
outlines
of
the
great
wire
fence
circling
the
testing
grounds
could
be
seen
and
beyond
that
the
twinkling
lights
of
tucson
already
visible
in
the
dusk
this
is
far
enough
gaddon
said
suddenly
he
watched
as
the
soldier
halted
then
gaddon
moved
up
quickly
behind
the
man
before
the
soldier
sensed
what
was
about
to
occur
gaddon's
hand
raised
over
his
head
and
the
butt
of
the
weapon
in
his
hand
crashed
against
the
back
of
the
man's
head
there
was
a
soft
groan
in
the
shadows
as
the
soldier
crumpled
limply
to
the
ground
in
the
silence
that
followed
gaddon's
tense
breathing
was
the
only
sound
he
looked
down
at
the
still
body
of
the
unconscious
man
then
he
quickly
turned
and
retraced
his
footsteps
back
the
way
he
had
come
when
he
had
reached
the
far
side
of
the
first
rocket
he
stopped
before
the
metal
steps
of
the
cradle
leading
up
to
the
closed
door
of
the
rocket
he
looked
quickly
about
him
making
sure
that
nobody
was
in
close
proximity
then
he
threw
his
gun
under
the
rocket
beside
the
rifle
of
the
soldier
and
ran
up
the
steps
a
cool
breeze
sprang
up
in
the
western
night
and
whispered
softly
around
gaddon
as
he
fumbled
for
a
moment
with
a
switch
set
in
the
smooth
side
of
the
rocket
beside
the
sealed
door
there
was
a
click
finally
and
the
door
slid
open
gaddon
took
a
last
look
about
him
and
then
quietly
slipped
through
the
opening
a
moment
later
there
was
the
sound
of
the
door
sliding
shut
inside
the
rocket
gaddon
lit
a
small
pocket
flash
and
looked
around
him
a
soft
sound
struck
his
ears
the
mewing
sound
of
a
cat
he
turned
the
flash
on
the
startled
animal
and
a
low
laughter
crept
from
his
throat
he
moved
through
the
large
instrument
chamber
then
and
sat
on
the
floor
beside
the
cat
then
the
flash
went
out
and
his
laughter
came
again






all
right
gentlemen
the
time
has
come
in
a
few
minutes
an
automatic
control
synchronized
with
controls
in
the
rocket
will
be
set
off
in
the
main
laboratory
building
if
we
want
to
watch
the
launching
we'll
have
to
hurry
fred
trent
listened
to
the
voice
of
mathieson
and
saw
the
famed
american
scientist
start
out
of
the
central
lobby
toward
the
launching
site
the
gathered
newspapermen
followed
their
voices
filled
with
excitement
now
that
the
moment
had
come
trent
followed
along
with
them
but
felt
a
peculiar
tenseness
within
him
he
had
been
watching
for
gaddon
to
make
his
appearance
but
as
yet
the
englishman
had
not
showed
up
was
it
possible
that
he
wasn't
going
to
watch
the
rocket
launching
as
trent
followed
the
others
out
into
the
gathering
night
he
frowned
to
himself
it
was
certainly
strange
and
entirely
unlike
the
blustering
manner
gaddon
had
displayed
on
the
drive
back
from
tucson
or
had
the
man
suddenly
realized
that
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
and
was
taking
this
easy
way
out
but
that
too
didn't
seem
natural
and
trent
found
himself
edging
forward
through
the
ranks
of
the
newsmen
until
he
had
reached
the
side
of
mathieson
the
scientist
was
talking
to
one
of
the
journalists
as
they
rounded
the
corner
of
the
administration
building
now
the
rockets
were
in
sight
standing
tall
and
immense
in
the
shadows
mathieson
held
his
hand
up
in
a
gesture
of
halt
and
the
men
behind
him
drew
into
a
compact
circle
fred
turned
to
mathieson
dr
mathieson
isn't
dr
gaddon
going
to
be
here
for
the
launching
the
head
of
the
rocket
project
turned
to
trent
fred
could
see
a
suddenly
puzzled
look
in
his
eyes
yes
that
is
strange

then
he
laughed
i
suppose
gaddon
is
in
the
laboratory
supervising
the
firing
controls
well
if
he
wants
to
miss
the
show
that's
his
fault
he
knows
the
schedule
trent
accepted
the
scientist's
words
without
replying
but
he
still
wasn't
satisfied
what
was
it
that
gaddon
had
said
in
the
car
about
the
biggest
story
of
the
year
what
had
the
man
meant
question
after
question
arose
in
trent's
mind
as
he
stood
there
and
always
the
queer
feeling
inside
him
grew
in
intensity
he
could
not
place
his
finger
on
it
but
somehow
he
knew
that
something
was
wrong
but
then
his
suspicions
were
put
aside
for
the
moment
as
he
heard
mathieson
say
all
right
gentlemen
the
time
is
nearly
here
in
precisely
one
minute
the
rocket
will
be
fired
the
statement
was
made
with
a
quiet
eagerness
and
then
suddenly
the
gathered
witnesses
grew
silent
trent's
eyes
along
with
the
others
fastened
on
the
looming
bulk
of
the
waiting
rocket
and
the
seconds
ticked
off
in
fred's
mind
as
he
counted
them
he
thought
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
within
a
very
few
moments
that
gigantic
hulk
of
smooth
tapered
metal
would
dislodge
itself
from
the
cradle
it
rested
in
with
a
burst
of
roaring
flame
that
in
another
few
seconds
it
would
shoot
into
the
blackened
sky
and
in
a
few
short
minutes
would
reach
unbelievable
heights
in
the
heavens
to
the
edge
of
space
itself
before
the
automatic
controls
released
the
instrument
section
to
be
returned
safely
to
earth
and
the
seconds
passed
time
trent
heard
the
voice
of
mathieson
rap
the
word
out
sharply
and
then
there
was
a
roar
of
sound
from
the
cradled
rocket
a
spear
of
flame
shot
from
its
base
exploding
the
night
into
a
brilliant
display
of
pyrotechnics





the
roaring
grew
louder
as
the
tremendous
power
of
the
now
unleashed
rockets
took
hold
of
the
night
air
fred
watched
as
the
flames
grew
white-hot
bright
and
then
he
saw
the
gigantic
rocket
shudder
in
its
cradle
the
shudder
grew
into
a
spasm
of
movement
and
then
slowly
but
steadily
growing
faster
the
rocket
lifted
from
its
cradle
fred's
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
rocket
now
a
feeling
of
awe
sweeping
through
him
he
suddenly
realized
how
puny
man
was
against
the
forces
man
could
unleash
forces
that
here
were
being
utilized
to
scientific
ends
but
forces
that
upon
a
moment's
notice
could
in
turn
be
unleashed
upon
the
rest
of
humanity
in
a
burning
devastating
terror
of
death
and
as
the
thought
flitted
across
his
mind
he
saw
the
rocket
gather
speed
as
it
left
its
cradle
it
was
now
rising
in
a
swift
sure
arc
lashing
into
the
dark
sky
like
a
fury
and
then
the
terrible
speed
of
the
rocket
took
hold
against
the
forces
of
gravity
and
it
shot
into
the
heavens
its
roaring
becoming
a
fading
hiss
of
sound
the
brilliant
flash
of
flame
from
its
exploding
tubes
a
receding
beacon
of
light
that
gradually
faded
to
a
pinpoint
far
over
their
heads
after
the
terrific
thunder
of
sound
that
had
accompanied
the
launching
of
the
rocket
the
sudden
silence
now
was
almost
palpable
the
gathered
witnesses
stood
mutely
awe
still
in
their
eyes
their
ears
still
ringing
with
the
sound
of
the
takeoff
finally
the
voice
of
mathieson
broke
the
quiet
night
air
well
gentlemen
that's
it
tomorrow
morning
we'll
scout
the
returned
section
it
should
land
somewhere
in
the
open
country
to
the
south
we've
computed
that
pretty
carefully
i
guess
that's
about
all
for--
his
voice
broke
off
suddenly
and
fred
trent
heard
what
must
have
distracted
the
scientist
a
man
was
shouting
from
the
vicinity
of
the
second
rocket
and
as
they
looked
a
dim
figure
could
be
seen
staggering
away
from
the
side
of
the
other
rocket
coming
slowly
toward
them
good
lord
mathieson
breathed
what's
that
man
doing
out
there
he
could
have
been
killed
then
suddenly
they
saw
the
staggering
figure
stumble
on
the
ground
and
then
trent
and
the
others
were
racing
across
the
ground
to
the
side
of
the
fallen
man
when
they
reached
him
mathieson
came
forward
and
knelt
beside
the
figure
why
it's
one
of
the
guards
he
said
in
shocked
surprise
and
it
was
then
that
the
strange
feeling
of
foreboding
hit
fred
again
as
he
knelt
beside
the
groaning
guard
it
swept
over
him
in
a
chilling
wave
he
lifted
the
man's
head
from
the
ground
and
the
guard
opened
his
eyes
he
recognized
the
face
of
mathieson
as
the
scientist
looked
anxiously
in
his
direction
good
heavens
man
what
happened
you
were
ordered
to
leave
five
minutes
before
launching
time
the
guard's
mouth
opened
as
he
struggled
to
a
sitting
position
the
man's
hand
reached
up
and
touched
the
back
of
his
head
painfully
sir--gaddon--dr
gaddon
attacked
me

there
was
a
momentary
stunned
silence
as
the
soldier's
words
sunk
in
on
the
gathered
men
what
mathieson's
voice
was
incredulous
and
as
trent
watched
the
soldier
nod
his
head
the
suspicion
he
had
felt
suddenly
overwhelmed
him
in
a
grim
realization
even
as
the
soldier
blurted
out
pain-filled
words
trent
knew
somehow
what
he
was
going
to
say
gaddon--he
pulled
a
gun
on
me

he
forced
me
to
the
far
side
of
number
two--he
said
he
was
going
up
in
the
rocket--he
said
he
had
plans--then
he
hit
me
with
the
gun

i
came
to
when
the
rocket
went
off--i
was
away
from
the
blasts
luckily

then
the
soldier
was
standing
on
his
feet
again
swaying
as
he
fought
to
clear
his
fogged
senses
but
trent
was
no
longer
aware
of
the
soldier
and
he
saw
that
mathieson
was
no
longer
looking
at
the
guard
for
a
brief
instant
their
eyes
met
and
trent
saw
a
stunned
look
in
the
scientist's
then
fred's
gaze
swept
up
into
the
night
up
into
the
darkened
sky
where
miles
above
them
the
hurtling
rocket
was
even
now
reaching
the
apex
of
its
flight
up
where
a
man
rode
on
a
perilous
trip
into
the
unknown





gaddon
hunched
in
the
darkness
of
the
rocket
waiting
he
had
counted
the
remaining
minutes
off
one
by
one
and
he
knew
that
finally
the
moment
was
at
hand
it
would
be
too
late
now
to
stop
him
they
had
not
noticed
his
absence
and
if
they
had
they
would
not
delay
the
launching
for
him
he
had
taken
that
fact
into
consideration
and
now
that
the
moment
was
close
to
completion
he
felt
a
glowing
sense
of
triumph
within
him
he
would
now
show
those
fools
and
especially
mathieson
he
would
prove
conclusively
that
cosmic
rays
were
what
he
had
said
they
were--a
source
of
the
energy
of
life
a
fountain
from
which
youth
and
vitality
would
pour
making
his
body
immortal
he
would
go
down
in
history
as
one
of
the
greats
of
science
a
man
who
had
risked
his
life
to
prove
his
theory
a
man
who
would
be
the
first
to
achieve
the
goal
of
the
ages
the
dream
of
the
philosophers
eternal
life
the
triumph
would
be
his
all
his
and
the
rocket
tubes
exploded
into
sound
gaddon
tensed
in
the
darkness
gripping
the
safety
straps
he
had
attached
to
himself
beside
him
he
felt
the
cat
let
out
a
frightened
mewing
sound
as
the
roar
of
the
exploding
rocket
power
grew
he
felt
the
furry
body
rubbing
against
his
side
seeking
sanctuary
against
this
dread
sound
and
then
the
rocket
trembled
with
sudden
movement
it
was
slow
at
first
but
then
it
grew
faster
and
gaddon
felt
a
faint
intensity
of
fear
in
his
temples
at
the
shuddering
power
of
that
movement
and
then
he
felt
the
blood
draining
from
his
head
making
him
faint
with
dizziness
as
the
rocket
accelerated
suddenly
into
a
terrible
burst
of
speed
he
could
feel
it
moving
swiftly
through
the
atmosphere
now
feel
the
tortured
rush
of
air
that
whipped
against
the
sides
of
the
projectile
in
a
moaning
dirge
that
mingled
with
the
roar
of
the
exploding
rocket
fuel
and
as
the
seconds
passed
he
became
accustomed
somewhat
to
the
increasing
velocity
of
the
projectile
and
the
dizziness
passed
from
his
head
then
he
became
aware
of
the
trembling
body
of
the
cat
beside
him
and
a
soft
laughter
rose
in
his
throat
but
it
died
stillborn
as
the
roar
of
the
rockets
grew
to
a
thundering
hiss
now
in
his
ears
and
he
felt
the
cool
sweetness
of
the
automatically
released
oxygen
fill
the
chamber
about
him
and
he
drank
it
into
his
lungs
hungrily
with
each
second
now
he
knew
the
projectile
was
racing
higher
into
the
rarefied
atmosphere
heading
steadily
out
to
where
the
air
of
earth
would
be
almost
non-existent
and
a
grim
smile
crossed
his
face
in
the
darkness
for
he
knew
that
shortly
the
rocket
would
enter
the
outermost
layers
and
the
cosmic
rays
would
play
with
all
their
energies
upon
the
projectile
and
he
tensed
suddenly
there
was
a
glow
that
sprang
into
being
in
the
chamber
about
him
it
was
dim
at
first
but
it
grew
steadily
in
intensity
around
him
revealing
the
interior
of
the
chamber
in
its
weird
light
an
exultation
swept
through
him
then
he
knew
they
had
entered
the
field
of
the
cosmic
rays
and
that
the
manifestation
of
light
he
saw
was
a
result
of
those
forces
of
nature
beside
him
the
cat
mewed
plaintively
in
fear
and
huddled
closer
against
gaddon's
body
his
eyes
watched
the
tiny
creature
for
a
moment
and
then
swept
around
the
large
chamber
at
the
massed
instrument
panels
that
were
recording
every
minute
fraction
of
a
second
of
the
flight
and
the
glow
grew
and
suddenly
the
hissing
of
the
exploding
rocket
fuel
began
to
diminish
in
volume
the
apex
of
the
flight
was
nearly
at
hand
then
and
the
glow
around
gaddon
began
to
color
from
a
weird
phosphorescent
whiteness
it
changed
to
a
dull
but
intense
yellow
and
with
the
change
a
strange
feeling
crept
through
his
body





it
tugged
at
him
with
invisible
hands
it
played
upon
his
every
nerve
his
every
fiber
the
innermost
feelings
of
his
sensibility
it
grew
stronger
this
alien
probing
within
him
grew
as
the
glow
pulsed
in
the
chamber
around
him
and
suddenly
instead
of
a
fierce
feeling
of
triumph
a
sense
of
dread
swept
through
him
he
fought
at
the
gripping
sensations
within
him
tried
to
dispel
them
to
no
avail
they
grew
stronger
like
invisible
hands
that
were
changing
the
very
essence
of
life
inside
him
and
as
the
thought
passed
through
his
suddenly
tortured
mind
he
realized
that
was
exactly
what
was
taking
place
a
change
a
change
beyond
his
comprehension
beyond
the
understanding
of
any
man
beyond--
and
the
whining
fearful
mew
of
the
cat
beside
him
changed
it
tensed
against
his
body
and
the
whine
in
its
animal
throat
became
an
irate
hiss
he
looked
down
and
saw
the
hackles
rising
on
the
back
of
the
cat
saw
the
creature
looking
up
at
him
now
not
with
wide
frightened
eyes
of
appeal
but
with
a
ferocity
of
wildness
that
brought
a
chill
to
his
inner
being
and
the
glow
grew
around
him
brilliant
yellow
in
texture
now
and
with
the
increasing
brilliance
of
the
light
the
feeling
of
change
grew
within
him
it
was
stronger
than
he
now
it
held
his
every
heartbeat
in
its
pulsing
grip
it
throbbed
in
his
temples
ached
to
the
ends
of
his
toes
set
his
body
aflame
with
it
and
the
cat
suddenly
lunged
against
him
its
sharpened
claws
biting
through
his
garments
and
into
his
flesh
his
hands
reached
down
in
a
quick
movement
and
gripped
the
body
of
the
cat
he
tore
the
raking
claws
away
from
his
body
and
held
the
cat
in
the
air
beside
him
the
creature
writhed
in
his
grasp
fighting
madly
to
escape
and
as
his
grip
tightened
on
the
animal
the
eyes
of
the
cat
suddenly
locked
with
his
he
felt
the
forces
within
him
reach
a
crescendo
at
that
moment
and
his
body
was
frozen
immobile
his
eyes
locked
on
the
cat's
eyes
burning
into
the
animal
the
animal
burning
into
him
burning
and
burning

it
could
only
have
been
a
matter
of
seconds
he
knew
but
they
were
seconds
that
stretched
into
the
farthermost
reaches
of
eternity
seconds
that
lived
a
million
years
and
passed
in
another
fleeting
instant
and
then
he
could
move
again
and
he
felt
strange
as
he
moved
it
was
as
if
he
was
another
person
as
if
the
body
he
moved
was
alien
to
him
as
if
it
had
never
belonged
to
him
to
any
man
to
any
thing
and
his
eyes
tore
away
from
the
now
dulled
expression
in
the
cat's
eyes
he
did
not
find
it
strange
that
this
was
so
he
knew
in
some
inner
sense
that
the
mighty
life
force
in
him
had
quelled
the
cat
had
stilled
the
fighting
in
its
feline
eyes
and
he
saw
his
hands
clutching
the
body
of
the
cat
he
stared
at
them
for
a
long
disbelieving
moment
for
they
were
not
the
hands
he
had
known
they
were
not
the
hands
of
blair
gaddon
they
were
not
the
hands
of
any
man
they
were
long
and
tapered
and
claw-like
there
was
dark
fuzzy
fur
around
them
fur
that
was
cat-like
deep
within
him
a
fear
struggled
upward
through
his
mind
a
cold
dread
that
forced
his
lips
to
move
to
utter
a
gasp
of
the
terror
he
felt
and
the
sound
left
his
lips
it
left
his
lips
and
echoed
terribly
in
his
ears
a
harsh
sound
a
mewing
sound
a
cat
sound

the
creature
in
his
grasp
struggled
feebly
then
it
was
a
small
movement
a
movement
without
vitality
almost
without
life
and
as
the
creature
moved
a
sense
of
rage
welled
up
inside
him
a
rage
that
he
could
not
control
an
anger
that
he
wanted
to
unleash
to
its
fullest
and
as
it
took
possession
of
him
the
human
part
of
his
mind
shrieked
and
forced
words
from
his
lips
you
fiend
you
fiend
of
hell
and
his
fingers
crept
up
to
the
neck
of
the
cat
and
closed
in
a
mighty
grip
he
felt
the
animal
give
a
single
desperate
effort
in
his
grasp
but
his
grip
tightened
and
he
saw
the
mouth
of
the
creature
open
wide
and
heard
a
faint
hissing
gasp
as
its
tongue
stuck
far
out
and
its
eyes
bulged
in
a
last
moment
of
life
then
the
animal
lay
limp
in
his
claw-like
hands
and
he
dropped
it
to
the
floor
of
the
rocket
chamber
a
growl
of
frustration
leaving
his
lips
he
stared
at
the
cat's
body
for
a
moment
then
his
fingers
stole
up
and
touched
his
face
he
felt
the
hairy
coarseness
of
it
the
furry
tingle
of
his
once
smooth
skin
and
he
screamed
into
the
now
fading
glow
that
he
knew
was
the
energy
of
the
cosmic
rays
no
no
it
can't
be
true
i
haven't
changed
like
this
i--i--meowrr

around
him
the
thunder
of
the
rocket
fuel
suddenly
vanished
into
silence
and
then
the
rocket
gave
a
lurch
deep
within
his
mind
he
knew
that
the
instrument
section
had
been
released
from
the
main
body
of
the
projectile
and
even
now
he
knew
the
sealed
chamber
was
falling
back
toward
the
earth
back
toward
the
atmosphere
where
the
parachute
would
take
hold
and
drift
the
chamber
safely
down
to
the
arizona
soil
and
a
dread
closed
over
him
in
that
moment
back
to
the
men
back
to
the
things
of
men
back
he
must
go
a
mewing
thing
that
was
not
a
man
a
thing
that
he
felt
was
taking
hold
of
him
driving
the
last
vestige
of
human
instinct
from
him
he
fought
it
he
fought
it
mewing
on
the
floor
of
the
rocket
chamber





he
must
have
gone
mad
fred
trent
pulled
his
gaze
from
the
sky
and
looked
with
stunned
eyes
at
the
figure
of
dr
mathieson
standing
beside
him
the
scientist
was
trembling
with
an
inner
feeling
and
his
head
was
shaking
in
disbelief
gaddon
the
man
is
going
to
his
death
it's
insane
again
mathieson's
voice
broke
the
silence
in
the
huddled
group
of
men
then
the
newspapermen
came
to
life
and
excited
talk
became
a
jabber
of
words
around
them
trent
took
the
arm
of
mathieson
and
turned
him
he
tried
to
lead
the
scientist
away
from
the
newspapermen
but
one
of
them
stepped
forward
and
grabbed
his
arm
but
why
did
he
do
it
doctor
the
man
must
have
had
a
reason
mathieson
shook
his
head
numbly
i--i
don't
know
unless

his
voice
trailed
off
for
a
moment
and
then
he
spoke
again
unless
he
really
believed
what
he
said

what
did
he
say
doctor
the
newsman
asked
there
was
a
puzzled
note
to
mathieson's
voice
as
he
answered
he
disagreed
with
me
on
the
supposed
effects
of
the
cosmic
rays
it
has
been
my
contention
that
they
are
of
lethal
effect
and
gaddon
maintained
that
i
was
wrong
he
kept
insisting
that
they
were
a
source
of
life
energy
that
was
why
we
decided
to
experiment
with
an
animal--to
see
what
effect
the
rays
would
have
on
a
living
creature

but
this
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
possibility--to
prove
his
point
he
signed
his
own
death
warrant
that's
a
story
doctor
a
real
story
trent
heard
the
newsman
exclaim
excitedly
and
then
it
came
to
him
that
the
real
story
was
as
yet
untold
the
real
story
that
had
been
unfolded
in
his
car
earlier
that
day
fred
moved
suddenly
away
from
the
clamor
of
the
newsmen
around
the
scientist
he
knew
what
he
had
to
do
he
hurried
across
the
ground
to
his
waiting
coupe
outside
the
administration
building
then
he
got
behind
the
wheel
and
started
the
motor
he
drove
to
the
gate
and
waited
until
the
guard
passed
him
through
then
he
turned
up
the
road
toward
tucson
as
he
drove
he
felt
an
odd
tenseness
sweep
through
him
for
he
was
thinking
of
what
gaddon
had
said
on
the
drive
up
to
the
proving
grounds
he
was
remembering
the
man's
words
on
the
cosmic
rays
and
the
secret
of
eternal
life
they
held
and
fred
trent
knew
that
this
was
the
biggest
story
the
story
that
he
alone
held
it
was
the
big
break
that
he
had
been
waiting
for
it
would
be
his
exclusive
the
inside
personal
story
of
a
man
who
had
died
to
prove
his
theory
told
as
gaddon
himself
had
related
it
with
all
the
vanity
of
the
man
all
the
pompous
assurance
he
had
shown
it
would
make
the
headlines
and
feature
sections
all
over
the
country
the
story
of
a
man
who
had
flown
to
his
death
in
quest
of
immortality
and
then
trent's
thoughts
grew
sober
suddenly
but
was
he
going
to
his
death
could
he
be
sure
that
mathieson
was
right
that
gaddon
was
suffering
from
some
streak
of
insanity
that
had
manifested
itself
in
this
final
venture
of
madness
or
could
it
be
that
gaddon
might
be
right
that

trent
set
his
lips
and
sighed
no
that
couldn't
be
true
it
was
beyond
the
comprehension
of
man
what
mattered
now
was
the
story
the
story
that
would
put
his
name
in
a
thousand
papers
all
over
the
country
and
he
thought
in
that
moment
of
joan
drake
a
warm
smile
pulled
at
his
lips
as
he
thought
of
her
this
would
force
her
to
quit
her
job
now
and
marry
him
the
one
condition
she
had
made--he
had
finally
overcome
he
thought
of
the
date
he
was
supposed
to
have
with
her
that
evening
it
would
have
to
be
postponed
until
later
the
story
came
first
and
then

he
drove
his
car
swiftly
through
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
into
the
main
part
of
town
then
he
pulled
up
before
the
offices
of
the
tucson
star
and
left
his
car
at
the
curb





he
entered
the
building
took
the
elevator
to
his
floor
and
walked
into
the
city
room
the
clatter
of
typewriters
met
his
ears
and
the
sound
was
sweet
to
him
in
that
moment
he
crossed
swiftly
to
his
desk
and
sat
dawn
then
he
motioned
to
a
copy
boy
the
boy
came
up
to
his
desk
jerry
tell
the
chief
to
hold
up
the
form
on
page
one
i've
got
a
special--an
accident
out
at
the
proving
grounds
headline
copy
the
youth
hurried
away
toward
the
office
of
the
city
editor
and
fred
picked
up
his
phone
and
dialed
a
number
he
waited
a
moment
and
then
the
voice
of
joan
drake
came
across
the
wire
dr
fenwick's
office
joan
this
is
fred
the
girl's
voice
laughed
across
the
wire
don't
tell
me
you're
planning
to
break
our
date
just
when
i
get
all
dressed
up
a
smile
crossed
trent's
lips
you're
almost
psychic
honey
fact
is
i
was
calling
to
tell
you
i'll
be
a
little
late
there
was
a
pause
and
when
the
girl
spoke
again
there
was
an
injured
note
in
her
voice
well
that's
a
fine
thing
i
wait
here
deliberately
after
hours
for
you
to
pick
me
up
and
now

you'll
be
late

what's
so
more
important
than
me
right
now
i
haven't
got
time

laughed

it

hour

hour
or
so
what
are
you
writing
the
great
american
novel
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
frowning
face
of
the
city
editor
approaching
his
desk
he
spoke
hurriedly
i've
got
to
sign
off
now
the
boss
is
coming
up
i'll
see
you
later
give
my
regards
to
brutus
he
replaced
the
phone
as
the
editor
reached
his
desk
what's
all
this
about
a
remake
on
the
front
page
trent
fred
nodded
that's
right
chief
the
biggest
story
since
the
atom
bomb
listen
he
gave
a
short
account
of
what
had
happened
and
then
added
the
personal
details
of
his
talk
with
gaddon
he
saw
the
eyes
of
the
editor
widen
as
he
went
on
and
by
the
time
he
had
finished
there
was
a
look
of
excitement
on
the
editor's
face
get
to
that
story
trent
write
it
hot
and
write

fast
i'll
hold

first

front
page

the
human
interest

up
big
we'll
hit
the
news
wires

after

go
to

then
a
smile
crossed
the
editor's
face
and
you'll
get
a
by-line
on
this
trent
that
ought
to
put
you
in
for
some
big
money
nice
work
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
was
hurrying
across
the
city
room
toward
his
glassed-in
office
hollering
for
a
copy
boy
as
he
went
trent
turned
back
to
his
desk
and
slipped
a
sheet
of
paper
into
his
typewriter
there
was
a
tenseness
around
his
eyes
as
he
brought
his
fingers
down
on
the
keys
for
a
moment
the
old
questions
rose
again
in
his
mind
was
gaddon
right
could
it
be
possible
that

then
he
forgot
everything
but
the
story
and
his
fingers
clicked
against
the
keys
putting
it
down
on
paper





the
rocket
chamber
swayed
gently
through
the
night
air
whistling
its
way
slowly
downward
moving
more
slowly
as
the
great
parachute
above
it
caught
in
the
rapidly
thickening
density
of
the
cabin's
atmosphere
inside
it
the
thing
that
had
been
gaddon
the
thing
that
was
no
longer
a
man
sat
on
the
floor
of
the
chamber
idly
toying
with
the
dead
body
of
the
cat
strange
thoughts
coursed
through
the
mind
inside
its
head
half
of
the
mind
that
belonged
to
gaddon
and
half
of
the
mind
that
was
an
alien
thing
a
creature
unnamed
there
was
a
thought
of
killing
and
the
thought
was
good
the
claw-like
hands
played
with
the
cat's
dead
body
fondling
it
idly
wishing
it
were
still
alive
so
that
it
might
die
again
and
the
other
part
of
its
mind
the
part
that
still
knew
it
was
gaddon
rebelled
against
the
thought
tried
to
drive
it
away
tried
to
move
that
alien
intelligence
into
the
rear
of
his
consciousness
a
growl
left
his
lips
as
he
struggled
with
it
and
then
a
whimpering
sound
for
now
the
alien
thought
of
killing
and
the
joy
it
had
experienced
as
the
cat
died
scant
moments
before
was
replaced
by
another
thought
a
thought
of
loneliness
it
was
a
weird
feeling
an
utter
loneliness
that
came
from
the
great
void
beyond
man's
planet
it
cried
out
in
silent
protest
for
it
knew
it
was
alone
in
this
world
of
men
and
it
knew
it
would
remain
alone
friendless
for
what
manner
of
men
such
as
the
other
part
of
its
mind
showed
would
react
in
a
friendly
fashion
where
would
be
their
common
meeting
ground
there
could
only
be
one
it
knew
and
that
one
was
fear
fear
and
the
hate
that
went
with
it
a
growl
left
its
lips
again
and
gaddon's
thoughts
tried
to
force
their
way
through
tried
and
failed
again
but
was
it
necessary
to
want
companionship
it
thought
about
that
for
a
moment
and
then
the
alien
beast
thoughts
grew
sharper
clearer
it
knew
suddenly
that
it
did
not
want
man's
compassion
it
knew
that
there
was
only
one
driving
thought
in
it
hate
hate
that
would
inspire
fear
fear
that
would
freeze
its
victim
into
terror
and
terror
that
would
be
replaced
by
death
and
then
it
would
be
happy
again
happy
to
sit
and
fondle
the
thing
that
had
been
alive
and
it
knew
something
else
it
knew
that
a
hunger
would
have
to
be
satisfied
a
hunger
that
called
for
flesh
deep
primeval
thoughts
raced
through
it
then
thoughts
that
were
spawned
in
the
ancient
jungles
of
a
new
and
steaming
world
a
world
where
great
cats
roamed
where
screams
of
cat-rage
split
the
air
as
tawny
bodies
arced
in
lightning
leaps
to
land
on
the
trembling
bodies
of
their
victims
it
was
a
satisfying
thought
a
thought
that
spanned
the
ages
of
earth
a
sense
that
was
inherent
in
all
cat
minds
through
the
ages
and
as
the
thought
raced
through
that
portion
of
its
mind
the
part
that
was
gaddon
struggled
to
fight
it
back
for
it
realized
with
a
sickness
that
spread
horror
through
it
that
the
thought
was
part
of
the
animal
existence
that
had
been
created
in
him
part
of
the
monster
that
lay
by
instinct
in
all
feline
creatures
and
gaddon
knew
that
the
dead
creature
at
his
feet
the
limp
and
twisted
body
of
the
cat
had
died
long
before
his
hands
had
crushed
it
in
their
mighty
grip
for
the
essence
of
that
life
that
animal
existence
had
been
merged
with
him
fused
by
a
mighty
source
from
outer
space





and
as
he
struggled
with
the
thought
fought
to
regain
the
balance
of
control
of
the
strange
body
that
was
now
his
the
rocket
chamber
swayed
in
a
gust
of
wind
from
without
and
as
he
clutched
the
sides
of
the
chamber
with
his
strong
claw-like
hands
the
chamber
gave
a
bounding
lurch
as
it
struck
the
ground
a
glancing
blow
there
was
a
grating
sound
as
the
metal
chamber
gouged
into
the
earth
sank
its
weight
upon
the
arizona
soil
and
the
thing
was
thrown
violently
against
the
side
of
the
chamber
then
there
was
quiet
again
gaddon's
mind
fought
to
the
fore
took
control
of
that
feline
man-shape
that
was
his
struggled
to
its
feet
and
moved
in
a
lithe
bound
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
chamber
a
clawed
hand
reached
up
where
gaddon
knew
the
release
mechanism
of
the
door
lay
and
pressed
it
the
door
slid
back
with
a
sliding
sound
and
the
cool
night
air
rushed
in
upon
it
gaddon
moved
his
cat-body
through
the
opening
and
bounded
to
the
ground
in
a
lithe
powerful
movement
he
felt
new
muscles
react
as
he
landed
on
the
ground
and
knew
that
there
was
a
great
strength
in
them
strength
that
was
waiting
to
be
used
and
he
felt
the
other
thoughts
starting
to
move
forward
in
his
mind
again
and
he
forced
them
back
he
knew
he
must
keep
control
of
that
mind
for
there
was
something
that
he
must
do
he
thought
desperately
about
it
and
the
pattern
became
clearer
in
his
mind
the
cosmic
rays
the
reaction
in
his
body
he
had
sought
immortality
in
the
door
to
outer
space
and
had
found
a
monster
waiting
for
him
a
force
that
had
changed
his
glands
grown
the
shaggy
fur
on
his
body
glands
that
had
warped
his
mind
opened
an
age-old
cunning
of
feline
thought
glands
gaddon's
thoughts
whipped
the
word
held
it
knew
it
must
be
the
answer
and
then
it
found
a
prayer
of
hope
and
a
name
that
went
with
that
thought
fenwick
i've
got
to
reach
fenwick
before
it's
too
late
before
it's
too
late
his
voice
came
hoarsely
strangely
formed
and
he
looked
wildly
about
him
he
saw
off
in
the
distance
a
glowing
of
lights
in
the
night
and
he
knew
somehow
that
it
was
the
city
of
tucson
and
in
that
city
at
its
very
edge
was
a
house
he
must
reach
he
stumbled
away
into
the
darkness
feeling
his
limbs
move
rapidly
then
smoothly
covering
the
ground
in
great
leaping
strides
and
though
gaddon's
thoughts
kept
the
balance
of
control
deep
inside
his
mind
the
monster
growled
with
a
cunning
laughter






fred
trent
pulled
the
last
sheet
of
paper
from
his
typewriter
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
exhausted
that
was
it
the
end
of
the
story
he
waved
his
hand
at
a
copy
boy
and
the
boy
ran
up
to
take
the
final
page
each
sheet
had
been
taken
like
that
to
be
immediately
set
in
the
composing
room
now
it
was
finished
the
story
of
the
year
and
as
trent
slowly
lit
a
cigarette
and
inhaled
deeply
he
knew
that
he
had
done
a
good
job
on
the
story
and
a
smile
crossed
his
face
as
he
thought
of
it
his
future
was
assured
now
there
could
be
no
more
stopgaps
no
more
delays
in
his
plans
to
marry
joan
and
settle
down
and
the
girl
would
have
to
agree
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
fred
felt
that
his
troubles
were
over
with
and
the
feeling
was
nice
it
spread
through
him
and
he
was
content
he
glanced
at
his
wrist
watch
and
frowned
the
story
had
taken
longer
than
he
had
anticipated
it
was
nearly
eleven
some
of
the
enthusiasm
ran
out
of
him
as
he
thought
of
joan
waiting
for
him
at
fenwick's
he
could
imagine
how
angry
she
must
be
by
now
he
got
up
quickly
from
his
desk
and
reached
for
his
hat
as
he
started
to
walk
away
the
phone
on
his
desk
rang
he
stepped
back
and
picked
up
the
receiver
trent
speaking
fred
trent
heard
his
name
uttered
in
terror
across
the
wire
and
he
felt
a
chill
run
through
him
as
he
recognized
the
voice
it
was
joan
drake
joan
what's
wrong
he
asked
anxiously
fred
come
quickly
bring
help
before
it's
too
late--he'll
kill
us
joan
for
god's
sake
calm
down
now
what's
the
matter
his
voice
held
a
tenseness
in
it
as
he
spoke
it's
gaddon
fred
only
it
isn't
gaddon--it's
a
monster
he'll
kill
us
gaddon
trent's
voice
spoke
incredulously
but
that's
imposs--
oh
fred
hurry--
i--oh--no--no
keep
away--
he
heard
the
girl
scream
over
the
phone
then
and
he
heard
something
else
a
growling
sound
a
sound
of
animal
noise
unlike
any
other
sound
he
had
ever
heard
and
then
as
he
shouted
into
the
phone
joan
joan
the
line
went
dead
he
stood
for
a
moment
staring
stupidly
at
the
receiver
in
his
hand
then
he
slammed
it
back
on
its
cradle
and
turned
he
nearly
knocked
over
the
copy
boy
who
hollered
at
him
hey
trent
the
boss
wants
you
in
his
office
but
he
swept
by
the
boy
unheeding
he
didn't
wait
for
the
elevator
he
took
the
stairs
in
leaping
bounds
and
then
he
was
on
the
main
floor
of
the
building
and
out
on
the
street
he
slammed
the
door
of
his
car
shut
and
started
the
motor
his
hands
trembled
as
he
meshed
the
gears
and
shot
the
coupe
away
from
the
curb
then
he
was
moving
swiftly
through
the
traffic
as
he
turned
down
the
street
where
fenwick's
office
was
fred
trent's
mind
was
a
whirl
of
confused
thought
there
was
fear
there
fear
and
dread
and
there
was
puzzlement
too
a
puzzlement
that
made
his
brain
spin
joan
had
spoken
with
terror
in
her
voice
terror
that
had
said
somebody
was
going
to
kill
and
joan
was
not
a
girl
to
be
easily
frightened
and
she
had
mentioned
gaddon's
name
gaddon
the
man
who
had
shot
into
the
heavens
in
an
experimental
rocket
gaddon
who
was
supposed
to
be
dead





he
felt
now
that
same
feeling
that
had
crept
through
him
after
the
launching
the
feeling
that
had
whispered
in
his
mind
that
maybe
gaddon
had
been
right
after
all
that
maybe
he
wouldn't
die
that
maybe

and
now
the
dread
swept
him
for
he
thought
of
the
sound
he
had
heard
over
the
phone
the
last
sound
before
the
line
went
dead
the
sound
of
an
animal
growling
in
wrath
and
he
remembered
the
girl's
scream
about
a
monster
a
cold
sweat
was
on
his
forehead
as
he
pulled
the
coupe
into
the
curb
in
front
of
the
fenwick
house
he
switched
off
the
motor
and
closed
the
car
door
after
him
then
he
was
hurrying
up
the
walk
to
the
front
door
his
eyes
taking
in
the
house
in
a
swift
glance
noting
that
the
lights
were
lit
in
the
consultation
room
lights
that
slivered
out
from
the
closed
venetian
blinds
he
stood
then
on
the
front
porch
his
hand
closing
over
the
knob
of
the
door
it
was
locked
he
pressed
the
bell
then
and
heard
its
clarion
sound
inside
the
house
but
other
than
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
a
deep
ominous
silence
that
somehow
brought
a
feeling
of
panic
to
him
was
he
too
late
and
then
suddenly
the
panel
in
the
front
of
the
door
opened
and
a
face
peered
out
at
him
fred
trent
felt
the
blood
drain
from
his
lips
a
paralysis
seemed
to
grip
his
body
at
what
he
saw
framed
in
the
opening
for
it
was
not
the
face
of
a
human
being
and
yet
it
was
not
the
face
of
an
animal
it
was
a
horrible
twisted
cat-like
visage
that
peered
out
at
him
furred
and
ugly
with
bared
teeth
and
glowing
feline
eyes
and
as
he
looked
a
sound
came
from
the
twisted
lips
it
was
the
same
sound
he
had
heard
over
the
telephone
the
sound
of
a
growling
rage
and
as
the
sound
hit
his
ears
a
terrible
realization
swept
over
him
for
his
eyes
riveted
on
that
monstrous
countenance
had
registered
an
impossible
fact
upon
his
mind
as
twisted
as
it
was
as
horribly
changed
into
an
animal
grimace
it
was
the
face
of
someone
he
knew--the
english
scientist
blair
gaddon
and
then
suddenly
the
face
vanished
from
the
opening
and
fred
trent
felt
his
paralysis
leave
him
he
knew
now
that
he
should
never
have
come
alone
that
he
should
have
called
the
police
first
that
he--
the
door
swung
open
then
and
trent
found
himself
facing
the
thing
that
had
been
gaddon
he
took
a
backward
step
and
started
to
turn
and
run
for
his
car
and
help
but
he
was
too
slow
an
arm
shot
out
and
a
claw-like
hand
suddenly
gripped
his
shoulder
in
a
swift
steel-like
movement
he
felt
himself
being
pulled
forward
and
into
the
house
as
another
growl
snarled
from
the
lips
of
the
creature
trent
tried
to
break
the
grip
of
that
vise-like
hand
he
tried
to
smash
his
fist
into
the
ugly
visage
of
a
face
that
confronted
him
but
he
was
like
a
child
in
that
grip
and
like
a
child
he
was
hurled
across
the
hall
and
he
heard
the
door
slam
shut
behind
him
as
he
got
slowly
to
his
feet
and
turned
to
face
the
creature
he
heard
a
sobbing
sound
from
the
open
door
of
the
consultation
room
it
was
the
voice
of
joan
drake
and
then
the
monster
had
reached
him
and
the
clawed
hand
reached
out
and
spun
him
through
the
doorway
into
the
consultation
room
and
he
heard
a
growling
voice
utter
harshly
you
will
regret
this
interference
trent
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
voice
of
blair
gaddon
and
yet
he
also
knew
that
it
was
not
the
same
voice
it
was
changed
it
had
a
bestial
quality
to
it
then
trent
looked
around
him
he
saw
joan
drake
huddled
in
a
corner
of
the
room
beside
dr
stanley
fenwick
the
specialist
was
sitting
in
a
chair
holding
his
right
hand
to
his
mouth
fred
could
see
blood
oozing
from
a
gash
in
the
surgeon's
lips





and
then
he
heard
another
sound
a
sound
from
without
the
house
coming
from
the
rear
it
was
the
baying
of
brutus
the
big
dog
must
have
sensed
the
presence
of
the
monster
and
it
was
protesting
in
its
animal
voice
a
mournful
dirge
then
his
attention
was
drawn
once
again
to
the
animal
body
of
blair
gaddon
and
now
that
the
first
shock
had
left
him
trent
stared
at
the
man
he
heard
the
girl
sob
fred
i
told
you
to
bring
help--
be
quiet
the
voice
of
gaddon
issued
from
the
twisted
lips
and
the
girl's
sob
stifled
itself
in
a
look
of
dread
then
the
face
that
had
been
gaddon
turned
to
trent
there
was
a
twisted
leer
to
it
and
fred
sensed
that
there
was
a
struggle
going
on
in
that
warped
mind
you
are
gaddon
the
blair
gaddon
who
went
up
with
the
experimental
rocket
trent's
voice
came
incredulously
the
face
of
the
creature
twisted
in
a
grimace
of
acknowledgment
yes
trent
i
am
blair
gaddon
i
am
not
a
pretty
sight
to
look
at
am
i
words
left
the
twisted
lips
and
there
was
a
bestial
pain
in
them
but--you're
supposed
to
be
dead
mathieson--
a
strange
sound
of
irony
came
from
gaddon
mathieson
was
right
about
the
cosmic
rays--i
know
that
now
look
at
me
you
see
what
has
happened
to
me
i
sought
immortality
through
the
life
energy
of
space--and
look
at
me
horror
reflected
in
fred's
eyes
in
that
moment
for
he
felt
the
pained
terror
in
the
voice
of
the
animal
shape
before
him
and
he
saw
the
claw-like
hands
clench
spasmodically
my
glands
the
voice
screamed
the
cosmic
rays
reacted
on
them--fed
the
essence
of
the
cat
into
them--changed
me
into
this
monstrous
being
trent
stared
at
the
rage-filled
face
felt
the
emotion
that
was
sweeping
through
the
creature
felt
a
sudden
compassion
that
was
erased
by
the
bestial
look
that
came
into
the
monster's
eyes
and
then
it
turned
toward
the
chair
where
fenwick
sat
the
doctor
was
looking
at
the
creature
his
eyes
wide
and
terrified
but
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
for
you
gaddon
why
do
you
stand
here
threatening--
fenwick's
voice
came
hoarsely
why
you
fool
because
there
is
so
little
time
i
am
changing
even
now
my
human
instincts
are
nearly
gone
you're
a
gland
specialist
there
is
something
you
can
do--stop
this
change--stop
it
fenwick
shook
his
head
slowly
you're
raving
like
a
madman
gaddon
i'm
not
a
god--do
you
think
i
can
change
something
that
is
beyond
human
understanding
if
you'll
only
let
me
call
in
the
authorities

a
growl
of
rage
left
gaddon's
animal
lips
authorities
so
you
can
have
me
put
in
cage
like
a
wild
beast
so
you
and
your
medical
experts
can
stand
and
watch
me
as
you
would
a
freak
you're
a
fool
you'll
help
me
now
you'll
do
something--before
it's
too
late
do
you
hear
me
the
creature
advanced
slowly
upon
the
doctor
and
the
girl
backed
away
to
the
far
wall
fear
mirrored
in
her
eyes
then
fred
trent
stepped
forward
his
voice
tense
hold
on
gaddon--of
course
the
doctor
will
help
you--won't
you
fenwick
there
was
an
urgent
emphasis
in
trent's
last
words
and
his
eyes
caught
those
of
the
surgeon's
and
held
them
in
a
meaningful
look
he
couldn't
say
what
he
wanted
to
but
the
message
in
his
eyes
was
imparted
to
fenwick
and
the
doctor
suddenly
nodded
yes--yes
of
course

but
you'll
have
to
remain
quiet
gaddon
and
be
patient
a
moment
the
creature
stopped
its
advance
upon
fenwick
then
and
a
growl
rumbled
in
gaddon's
animal
throat
then
fred
watched
as
the
doctor
stepped
swiftly
to
a
table
with
instruments
and
hurriedly
began
to
prepare
a
hypodermic
i'll
give
you
a
special
extract
injection
to
start
fenwick
explained
as
he
worked
and
trent
knew
that
the
doctor
was
preparing
an
injection
that
would
subdue
the
monster
that
would
enable
them
to
call
the
police
and
the
eyes
of
gaddon
watched
the
fingers
of
the
surgeon
prepare
the
hypodermic
and
for
a
single
moment
the
human
part
of
gaddon's
monster
mind
relaxed
its
tenacious
hold





there
was
a
rumble
of
raging
thought
deep
within
his
twisted
brain
it
swept
up
gripped
the
human
element
and
enveloped
it
a
hoarse
mewing
sound
left
the
twisted
lips
as
the
mind
became
a
single
bestial
thing
and
now
it
thought
with
a
viciousness
it
knew
now
that
it
was
finally
in
control
that
the
full
change
had
been
completed
and
it
knew
suddenly
what
it
wanted
its
animal
eyes
stared
at
the
three
humans
and
it
felt
a
hatred
for
the
men
who
did
not
understand
it
and
it
felt
a
desire
for
the
woman
who
feared
it
a
desire
that
crept
out
of
the
primeval
jungles
that
swept
through
it
to
find
one
of
its
kind
and
there
was
the
vague
instinct
that
was
gaddon
who
told
it
how
to
fulfill
that
desire
gaddon
who
knew
where
the
secret
lay
and
then
there
was
the
driving
urge
that
swept
up
from
the
animal
ages
the
urge
to
kill
to
destroy
what
was
hated
and
the
eyes
of
the
monster
fastened
on
the
figure
of
fenwick
as
the
doctor
turned
from
the
table
the
hypodermic
in
his
hand
all
right
gaddon

the
voice
of
fenwick
trailed
off
and
fred
trent
stared
at
the
face
of
the
monster
what
he
saw
there
brought
a
chill
to
his
being
and
he
heard
the
girl
gasp
from
the
far
corner
of
the
room
as
her
eyes
too
saw
the
change
that
had
spread
over
the
face
of
the
creature
for
there
was
no
longer
any
vestige
of
human
recognition
in
that
face
there
was
no
longer
any
trace
of
the
man
who
had
been
gaddon
there
was
only
the
monster
now
the
twisted
leering
lips
of
an
animal
mind
a
harsh
growl
left
those
lips
then
and
the
creature
moved
forward
toward
the
surgeon
trent
knew
what
was
happening
and
he
knew
what
he
must
do
there
was
death
on
that
bestial
face
death
that
was
reaching
out

he
heard
the
dim
baying
of
the
great
dane
from
the
rear
of
the
house
as
he
leaped
forward
then
his
fist
lashed
out
and
caught
the
animal
face
in
a
lashing
blow
his
knuckles
felt
numb
as
he
screamed
the
hypodermic--doctor--quick
then
the
creature
turned
on
him
and
a
long
arm
shot
out
trent
felt
a
claw
rake
across
his
face
and
felt
the
burning
bite
of
that
claw
sink
into
his
flesh
then
as
he
tried
to
dodge
away
from
the
beast
and
bring
his
fist
up
again
the
monster
leaped
at
him
and
trent
felt
a
powerful
blow
crash
against
his
chin
he
spun
back
falling
to
the
floor
his
head
hitting
the
edge
of
an
examining
table
his
senses
reeled
and
he
felt
the
blood
running
down
his
cheek
a
warm
sticky
stream
that
dripped
to
the
floor
he
fought
to
keep
his
consciousness
as
he
saw
the
beast
turn
away
from
him
satisfied
that
he
was
out
of
the
way
then
he
saw
it
leap
at
the
stunned
figure
of
fenwick
he
heard
the
girl
scream
in
terror
and
he
saw
fenwick's
arm
come
up
with
the
hypodermic
he
saw
the
doctor
try
to
bring
the
needle
down
in
a
jab
but
the
monster's
arm
swept
the
needle
aside
and
then
a
claw-like
hand
gripped
fenwick's
throat
there
was
a
gasp
of
terror
from
fenwick's
lips
as
those
fingers
closed
around
his
neck
then
the
hypodermic
fell
from
his
nerveless
hand
and
he
fought
to
break
away
a
deep
rumbling
growl
spat
from
the
lips
of
the
monster
as
it
closed
with
the
struggling
figure
of
fenwick
then
the
claws
that
were
its
hands
raked
the
surgeon's
throat
in
a
feline
rage
trent
watched
with
numbed
eyes
fighting
back
the
wave
of
blackness
that
threatened
to
overcome
him
and
he
saw
the
figure
of
fenwick
suddenly
go
limp
in
the
grip
of
the
monster
he
saw
a
spurt
of
blood
burst
from
the
man's
torn
throat
and
then
the
creature
dropped
the
limp
body
it
fell
to
the
floor
and
a
wave
of
red
washed
across
the
floor
from
the
mangled
throat
the
monster
stood
over
the
lifeless
body
a
triumphant
sound
issuing
from
its
twisted
lips
then
it
turned
toward
the
girl
trent
tried
to
move
he
tried
to
push
back
the
weakness
that
numbed
his
body
but
he
couldn't
his
head
swam
with
the
pain
of
the
blow
he
had
received
and
he
could
only
watch
through
half-closed
eyes
as
the
monster
reached
out
for
the
girl
joan
drake
screamed
once
as
the
long
arms
reached
out
for
her
then
her
voice
ended
abruptly
as
she
fell
to
the
floor
in
a
faint
the
monster
stood
over
her
for
a
moment
then
it
reached
down
and
picked
up
her
body
in
its
blood
splattered-arms
it
turned
for
a
moment
holding
the
girl
and
shot
a
hate-filled
glance
at
trent's
limp
figure
then
it
moved
swiftly
across
the
room
and
out
into
the
hall
and
the
baying
of
the
great
dane
sounded
angrily
in
fred
trent's
ears






with
a
superhuman
effort
fred
trent
forced
the
numbness
from
his
body
and
moved
slowly
to
his
feet
a
horror
gripped
him
that
brought
a
new
strength
to
his
body
flooded
it
he
stepped
over
the
body
of
fenwick
forcing
his
eyes
away
from
the
grisly
sight
of
it
as
he
dashed
to
the
hallway
joan--joan
the
girl's
name
came
hoarsely
from
his
lips
as
he
ran
into
the
hall
and
stared
at
the
open
door
of
the
house
he
ran
to
the
door
and
out
into
the
night
his
eyes
stared
wildly
into
the
darkness
searching
the
street
but
he
saw
nothing
but
his
parked
car
at
the
curb
the
monster
had
vanished
and
with
him
the
unconscious
girl
a
hopeless
despair
welled
up
inside
trent
at
that
moment
for
he
knew
he
could
never
hope
to
find
the
creature
now
and
by
the
time
help
came
it
would
be
too
late
they
would
find
joan's
mangled
body

the
baying
of
the
great
dane
rang
in
his
ears
then
the
huge
dog's
howls
of
rage
thundered
in
his
ears
and
he
heard
the
hound
crash
its
great
body
against
the
closed
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
striving
to
get
through
and
then
a
cry
of
hope
left
trent's
lips
he
turned
and
ran
back
into
the
house
he
grabbed
the
long
leash
from
its
wall
hook
beside
the
rear
door
and
then
he
swung
the
door
partway
open
brutus
quiet
brutus
the
head
of
the
great
dane
struggled
through
the
partly
opened
door
a
snarl
of
rage
welling
from
the
huge
dog's
mouth
as
trent
shouted
at
it
then
he
slipped
the
leash
into
its
metal
ring
around
the
neck
of
the
dog
and
pulled
the
door
open
the
animal
rushed
into
the
hall
nearly
tearing
the
leash
from
fred
trent's
hands
as
it
lunged
forward
the
dog
paused
beside
the
open
door
of
the
consultation
room
where
the
body
of
fenwick
lay
dead
and
still
on
the
floor
the
animal
lifted
its
muzzle
and
sniffed
the
air
a
howl
of
anguished
rage
left
it
then
and
trent
knew
that
the
dog
sensed
its
master
had
been
murdered
and
then
it
caught
the
scent
of
the
monster
the
thing
that
had
caused
its
wild
rage
to
be
unleashed
and
it
leaped
forward
down
the
hall
and
out
the
front
door
into
the
night
trent
held
the
leash
tightly
in
his
hands
running
behind
the
straining
dog
jumping
over
a
low
hedge
after
the
animal
as
it
headed
down
the
shadowed
street
to
the
edge
of
the
city
and
then
the
last
house
was
behind
them
and
trent
was
racing
behind
the
dog
out
into
the
desert
land
beyond





his
breath
was
an
aching
fire
in
his
throat
his
legs
were
numbed
beyond
feeling
they
were
parts
of
his
body
that
simply
refused
to
stop
moving
though
every
nerve
and
muscle
in
them
screamed
in
protest
it
seemed
like
he
had
been
running
for
hours
half
tripping
stumbling
across
the
darkened
ground
behind
the
seemingly
tireless
body
of
the
great
dane
they
ran
in
near
silence
now
only
the
sounds
of
their
labored
breathing
mingled
with
the
night
wind
the
howls
of
rage
no
longer
issued
from
the
throat
of
the
huge
dog
there
was
only
its
panting
breath
and
the
strain
of
its
mighty
body
as
it
sought
to
tear
loose
from
the
man
holding
it
but
trent
held
grimly
to
the
leash
running
as
fast
as
his
numbed
body
would
go
and
he
knew
he
could
not
go
much
further
that
soon
he
would
drop
to
the
ground
in
exhaustion
that
his
last
reserve
of
energy
was
nearly
spent
and
then
his
eyes
peered
through
the
darkness
ahead
and
he
saw
a
glow
of
lights
in
the
distance
and
suddenly
he
knew
those
lights
and
he
became
aware
of
where
they
were
racing
toward
it
was
the
rocket
proving
grounds
and
the
fence
of
the
government
project
loomed
close
ahead
and
as
they
neared
the
fence
trent's
eyes
pierced
the
darkness
and
he
saw
a
jagged
tear
in
the
metal
mesh
of
the
fence
a
tear
that
stood
as
high
as
a
man
a
hole
through
which
a
man
could
have
entered
the
great
dane
bounded
toward
that
hole
and
trent
followed
the
dog
through
it
he
felt
the
animal
pause
momentarily
and
he
nearly
stumbled
over
a
body
lying
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
just
inside
the
fence
his
heart
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
the
girl's
name
sped
to
his
lips
but
he
never
uttered
the
word
for
he
suddenly
saw
that
it
was
the
body
of
a
guard
a
body
whose
torn
throat
lay
red
and
gory
in
death
and
then
the
great
dane
let
a
howl
of
anger
out
on
the
night
wind
and
the
beast
leaped
forward
again
trent
running
behind
it
and
ahead
of
them
trent
saw
a
great
looming
shape
in
the
darkness
and
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
it
a
despairing
terror
gripped
him
it
was
the
second
rocket
standing
in
its
cradle
silent
in
the
night
a
shaft
of
metal
that
looked
skyward
and
a
realization
of
what
the
monster
had
in
mind
struck
him
he
knew
now
where
they
were
headed
he
knew
why
the
monster
had
torn
the
fence
why
a
guard
had
been
killed
where
he
stood
and
as
if
the
thought
had
been
a
prelude
he
saw
the
rocket
loom
before
them
as
the
great
dane
bounded
around
its
base
and
he
saw
the
metal
stairway
leading
up
to
the
middle
of
the
giant
projectile
and
at
the
top
of
those
stairs
going
into
the
now
open
rocket
chamber
was
the
monster
holding
the
unconscious
girl
in
its
arms
the
great
dane
saw
the
creature
in
the
same
instant
and
a
terrible
howl
of
rage
welled
from
its
throat
it
gave
a
lunge
forward
then
that
broke
trent's
grip
from
the
leash
he
held
and
the
dog
was
free





the
monster
turned
in
the
same
moment
and
saw
them
a
roar
of
feline
anger
left
its
throat
as
the
huge
dog
leaped
up
the
steps
toward
the
platform
above
the
monster
dropped
the
girl's
body
on
the
narrow
platform
and
backed
toward
the
opening
of
the
rocket
chamber
then
the
great
dane
reached
the
platform
and
poised
itself
for
a
leap
trent
was
dashing
forward
toward
the
stairs
as
the
dog's
body
flew
through
the
air
he
saw
the
flashing
jaws
of
the
animal
snap
at
the
throat
of
the
monster
as
its
heavy
body
smashed
against
it
then
the
arms
of
the
creature
were
tearing
at
the
dog
as
it
was
forced
back
into
the
rocket
chamber
trent's
feet
flew
up
the
stairs
his
breath
a
tortured
gasp
in
his
throat
he
saw
the
girl
stir
on
the
platform
as
consciousness
returned
to
her
joan
her
name
sped
from
his
lips
as
he
reached
the
top
step
then
his
hands
closed
around
the
girl's
shoulders
lifting
her
to
her
feet
the
snarl
of
the
great
dane
reached
his
ears
from
the
rocket
chamber
and
the
answering
roar
of
rage
from
the
monster
as
they
fought
his
eyes
saw
the
vague
terrible
shadows
of
them
heard
the
snapping
jaws
of
the
dog
and
the
raking
claws
and
then
he
was
dragging
the
girl
down
the
steps
they
reached
the
ground
and
trent
pulled
her
away
from
the
rocket
felt
her
come
to
life
in
his
arms
heard
the
sob
on
her
lips
but
his
head
turned
away
from
her
and
he
stared
anxiously
up
at
the
open
rocket
chamber
he
heard
the
bodies
of
the
monster
and
the
dog
slam
against
the
inner
side
of
the
chamber
and
then
he
saw
the
door
of
the
rocket
close
he
knew
that
the
automatic
mechanism
must
have
been
touched
in
the
battle
and
even
as
the
thought
ran
through
his
mind
he
heard
a
sudden
roar
of
flaming
sound
the
night
lit
up
in
a
sheet
of
brilliant
light
and
a
wave
of
flame
spread
out
from
the
base
of
the
rocket
trent
pulled
the
girl
away
from
that
blinding
sheet
of
exploding
energy
and
his
eyes
stared
in
grim
fascination
as
they
ran
he
saw
the
rocket
shudder
in
its
cradle
and
then
lift
slowly
it
was
as
if
time
had
turned
back
and
he
were
watching
an
identical
scene
that
had
happened
earlier
that
day
only
it
wasn't
the
same
scene
it
was
now
a
scene
of
horror
for
he
knew
that
the
monster
and
the
dog
were
in
that
rocket
the
rocket
that
would
shoot
skyward
in
moments
even
as
its
companion
had
done
would
reach
into
the
outer
fringes
of
the
earth's
atmosphere
where
the
cosmic
rays
would
envelop
it
would
react
upon
the
animals
inside
it
and
a
terrible
dread
spread
through
trent
at
the
thought
for
if
the
first
change
had
been
terrible
enough
what
would
happen
now
and
as
he
thought
he
saw
the
rocket
lift
slowly
from
its
cradle
and
gather
speed
as
it
shot
upward
into
the
night





the
blinding
light
of
the
exploding
rocket
fuel
lit
the
proving
grounds
like
a
huge
beacon
of
incandescence
and
trent
was
aware
of
shouts
ahead
of
him
and
running
feet
then
he
was
surrounded
by
men
from
the
project
and
he
caught
the
glint
of
alert
weapons
and
uniforms
he
felt
arms
grab
him
and
the
girl
and
heard
questions
pounding
at
him
but
then
he
saw
a
face
he
knew
and
he
tore
away
from
the
arms
of
the
guards
and
shouted
dr
mathieson
listen
to
me
the
scientist
stepped
up
to
him
and
trent
gripped
his
arm
in
the
fading
light
of
the
vanishing
rocket
what's
happened
here
the
scientist
demanded
aren't
you
one
of
the
newsmen--
trent
interrupted
him
he
poured
out
a
string
of
words
words
that
told
what
had
happened
and
as
he
talked
he
saw
the
eyes
of
the
scientist
widen
in
disbelief
and
he
heard
the
guards
grow
silent
around
him
felt
every
ear
listening
with
awe
to
his
words
and
when
he
had
finished
there
was
a
long
moment
of
silence
and
then
joan
drake
moved
tremblingly
up
beside
trent
and
she
spoke
it's
true
doctor
every
word
fred
said
is
true
and
one
of
the
guards
broke
in
the
word
just
came
in
from
post
four
the
fence
was
torn
to
pieces--and
giddings
has
been
murdered--just
as
they
said
then
the
silence
again
and
the
face
of
mathieson
was
grim
as
trent
broke
through
the
quiet
--doctor--that
monster
who
was
gaddon--he's
up
there
now
when
the
cosmic
rays
change
him
and
the
dog
and
the
chamber
is
released

the
scientist
shook
his
head
slowly
a
look
of
awe
in
his
eyes
it
won't
release
trent
he
said
fred
trent
looked
at
him
questioningly
gaddon
must
have
forgotten
one
thing
the
scientist
continued
that
rocket
was
also
an
experimental
project
but
not
for
the
same
purpose
it
was
to
test
a
new
type
of
explosive

mathieson's
voice
trailed
off
and
silence
closed
over
the
small
group
then
there
was
no
need
to
say
anything
further
there
was
only
the
tension
of
waiting
the
tension
that
showed
in
every
eye
and
the
girl
moved
closer
to
trent
her
body
trembling
against
his
they
waited
the
seconds
passed
like
moments
in
eternity
slowly
they
marched
by
one
by
one
and
then
a
minute
and
the
tension
grew
they
heard
it
then
off
in
the
distance
out
in
the
waste
of
the
open
desert
land
a
thundering
sound
an
explosion
that
rolled
in
a
wave
of
sound
and
with
it
a
flash
of
brilliant
light
light
that
seared
through
the
night
in
a
terrible
wave
and
with
it
the
thunder
of
the
explosive
warhead
and
then
silence
after
a
long
moment
the
voice
of
mathieson
came
through
the
quiet
night
wind

it's
over
gaddon
is--dead
poor
fool
he
fumbled
with
the
tools
of
creation
tools
that
man
is
not
ready
to
wield

and
trent
heard
one
of
the
soldiers
gasp
what
a
story
what
a
story
but
he
knew
as
he
held
the
girl
against
him
felt
her
body
relax
beside
his
that
it
was
a
story
he
didn't
want
to
write
he
wanted
only
to
forget
