the
unprecedented
success
of
the
romance
of
varney
the
vampyre
leaves
the
author
but
little
to
say
further
than
that
he
accepts
that
success
and
its
results
as
gratefully
as
it
is
possible
for
any
one
to
do
popular
favours

it
rapidly
spread
to

southern
regions

firm
hold
of

of
the
more
credulous
portion
of
mankind
the
following
romance
is
collected
from
seemingly
the
most
authentic

the

must
leave
the

entirely
to
his
readers

omitted
in

extraordinary

----how

midnight--the

the
solemn

of
an

midnight--the

like

pervades
all

like
the
ominous
calm
which
precedes
some
more
than
usually
terrific
outbreak
of
the
elements
they
seem
to
have
paused
even
in
their
ordinary
fluctuations
to
gather
a
terrific
strength
for
the
great
effort
a
faint
peal
of
thunder
now
comes
from
far
off
like
a
signal
gun
for
the
battle
of
the
winds
to
begin
it
appeared
to
awaken
them
from
their
lethargy
and
one
awful
warring
hurricane
swept
over
a
whole
city
producing
more
devastation
in
the
four
or
five
minutes
it
lasted
than
would
a
half
century
of
ordinary
phenomena
it
was
as
if
some
giant
had
blown
upon
some
toy
town
and
scattered
many
of
the
buildings
before
the
hot
blast
of
his
terrific
breath
for
as
suddenly
as
that
blast
of
wind
had
come
did
it
cease
and
all
was
as
still
and
calm
as
before
sleepers
awakened
and
thought
that
what
they
had
heard
must
be
the
confused
chimera
of
a
dream
they
trembled
and
turned
to
sleep
again
all
is
still--still
as
the
very
grave
not
a
sound
breaks
the
magic
of
repose
what
is
that--a
strange
pattering
noise
as
of
a
million
of
fairy
feet
it
is
hail--yes
a
hail-storm
has
burst
over
the
city
leaves

with
small
boughs
windows
that
lie
most
opposed
to
the
direct
fury
of
the
pelting
particles
of
ice
are
broken
and
the
rapt
repose
that
before
was
so
remarkable
in
its
intensity
is
exchanged
for
a
noise
which
in
its
accumulation
drowns
every
cry
of
surprise
or
consternation
which
here
and
there
arose
from
persons
who
found
their
houses
invaded
by
the
storm
now
and
then
too
there
would
come
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
that
in
its
strength
as
it
blew
laterally
would
for
a
moment
hold
millions
of
the
hailstones
suspended
in
mid
air
but
it
was
only
to
dash
them
with
redoubled
force
in
some
new
direction
where
more
mischief
was
to
be
done
oh
how
the
storm
raged
hail--rain--wind
it

in

an
awful

there
is
an
antique
chamber
in
an
ancient
house
curious
and
quaint
carvings
adorn
the
walls
and
the
large
chimney-piece
is
a
curiosity
of
itself
the
ceiling
is
low
and
a
large
bay
window
from
roof
to
floor
looks
to
the
west
the
window
is
latticed
and
filled
with
curiously
painted
glass
and
rich
stained
pieces
which
send
in
a
strange
yet
beautiful
light
when
sun
or
moon
shines
into
the
apartment
there
is
but
one
portrait
in
that
room
although
the
walls
seem
panelled
for
the
express
purpose
of
containing
a
series
of
pictures
that
portrait
is
of
a
young
man
with
a
pale
face
a
stately
brow
and
a
strange
expression
about
the
eyes
which
no
one
cared
to
look
on
twice
there
is
a
stately
bed
in
that
chamber
of
carved
walnut-wood
is
it
made
rich
in
design
and
elaborate
in
execution
one
of
those
works
of
art
which
owe
their
existence
to
the
elizabethan
era
it
is
hung
with
heavy
silken
and
damask
furnishing
nodding
feathers
are
at
its
corners--covered
with
dust
are
they
and
they
lend
a
funereal
aspect
to
the
room
the
floor
is
of
polished
oak
god
how
the
hail
dashes
on
the
old
bay
window
like
an
occasional
discharge
of
mimic
musketry
it
comes
clashing
beating
and
cracking
upon
the
small
panes
but
they
resist
it--their
small
size
saves
them
the
wind
the
hail
the
rain
expend
their
fury
in
vain
the
bed
in
that
old
chamber
is
occupied
a
creature
formed
in
all
fashions
of
loveliness
lies
in
a
half
sleep
upon
that
ancient
couch--a
girl
young
and
beautiful
as
a
spring
morning
her
long
hair
has
escaped
from
its
confinement
and
streams
over
the
blackened
coverings
of
the
bedstead
she
has
been
restless
in
her
sleep
for
the
clothing
of
the
bed
is
in
much
confusion
one
arm
is
over
her
head
the
other
hangs
nearly
off
the
side
of
the
bed
near
to
which
she
lies
a
neck
and
bosom
that
would
have
formed
a
study
for
the
rarest
sculptor
that
ever
providence
gave
genius
to
were
half
disclosed
she
moaned
slightly
in
her
sleep
and
once
or
twice
the
lips
moved
as
if
in
prayer--at
least
one
might
judge
so
for
the
name
of
him
who
suffered
for
all
came
once
faintly
from
them
she
has
endured
much
fatigue
and
the
storm
does
not
awaken
her
but
it
can
disturb
the
slumbers
it
does
not
possess
the
power
to
destroy
entirely
the
turmoil
of
the
elements
wakes
the
senses
although
it
cannot
entirely
break
the
repose
they
have
lapsed
into
oh
what
a
world
of
witchery
was
in
that
mouth
slightly
parted
and
exhibiting
within
the
pearly
teeth
that
glistened
even
in
the
faint
light
that
came
from
that
bay
window
how
sweetly
the
long
silken
eyelashes
lay
upon
the
cheek
now
she
moves
and
one
shoulder
is
entirely
visible--whiter
fairer
than
the
spotless
clothing
of
the
bed
on
which
she
lies
is
the
smooth
skin
of
that
fair
creature
just
budding
into
womanhood
and
in
that
transition
state
which
presents
to
us
all
the
charms
of
the
girl--almost
of
the
child
with
the
more
matured
beauty
and
gentleness
of
advancing
years
was
that
lightning
yes--an
awful
vivid
terrifying
flash--then
a
roaring
peal
of
thunder
as
if
a
thousand
mountains
were
rolling
one
over
the
other
in
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
who
sleeps
now
in
that
ancient
city
not
one
living
soul
the
dread
trumpet
of
eternity
could
not
more
effectually
have
awakened
any
one
the
hail
continues
the
wind
continues
the
uproar
of
the
elements
seems
at
its
height
now
she
awakens--that
beautiful
girl
on
the
antique
bed
she
opens
those
eyes
of
celestial
blue
and
a
faint
cry
of
alarm
bursts
from
her
lips
at
least
it
is
a
cry
which
amid
the
noise
and
turmoil
without
sounds
but
faint
and
weak
she
sits
upon
the
bed
and
presses
her
hands
upon
her
eyes
heavens
what
a
wild
torrent
of
wind
and
rain
and
hail
the
thunder
likewise
seems
intent
upon
awakening
sufficient
echoes
to
last
until
the
next
flash
of
forked
lightning
should
again
produce
the
wild
concussion
of
the
air
she
murmurs
a
prayer--a
prayer
for
those
she
loves
best
the
names
of
those
dear
to
her
gentle
heart
come
from
her
lips
she
weeps
and
prays
she
thinks
then
of
what
devastation
the
storm
must
surely
produce
and
to
the
great
god
of
heaven
she
prays
for
all
living
things
another
flash--a
wild
blue
bewildering
flash
of
lightning
streams
across
that
bay
window
for
an
instant
bringing
out
every
colour
in
it
with
terrible
distinctness
a
shriek
bursts
from
the
lips
of
the
young
girl
and
then
with
eyes
fixed
upon
that
window
which
in
another
moment
is
all
darkness
and
with
such
an
expression
of
terror
upon
her
face
as
it
had
never
before
known
she
trembled
and
the
perspiration
of
intense
fear
stood
upon
her
brow
what--what
was
it
she
gasped
real
or
a
delusion
oh
god
what
was
it
a
figure
tall
and
gaunt
endeavouring
from
the
outside
to
unclasp
the
window
i
saw
it
that
flash
of
lightning
revealed
it
to
me
it
stood
the
whole
length
of
the
window
there
was
a
lull
of
the
wind
the
hail
was
not
falling
so
thickly--moreover
it
now
fell
what
there
was
of
it
straight
and
yet
a
strange
clattering
sound
came
upon
the
glass
of
that
long
window
it
could
not
be
a
delusion--she
is
awake
and
she
hears
it
what
can
produce
it
another
flash
of
lightning--another
shriek--there
could
be
now
no
delusion
a
tall
figure
is
standing
on
the
ledge
immediately
outside
the
long
window
it
is
its
finger-nails
upon
the
glass
that
produces
the
sound
so
like
the
hail
now
that
the
hail
has
ceased
intense
fear
paralysed
the
limbs
of
that
beautiful
girl
that
one
shriek
is
all
she
can
utter--with
hands
clasped
a
face
of
marble
a
heart
beating
so
wildly
in
her
bosom
that
each
moment
it
seems
as
if
it
would
break
its
confines
eyes
distended
and
fixed
upon
the
window
she
waits
froze
with
horror
the
pattering
and
clattering
of
the
nails
continue
no
word
is
spoken
and
now
she
fancies
she
can
trace
the
darker
form
of
that
figure
against
the
window
and
she
can
see
the
long
arms
moving
to
and
fro
feeling
for
some
mode
of
entrance
what
strange
light
is
that
which
now
gradually
creeps
up
into
the
air
red
and
terrible--brighter
and
brighter
it
grows
the
lightning
has
set
fire
to
a
mill
and
the
reflection
of
the
rapidly
consuming
building
falls
upon
that
long
window
there
can
be
no
mistake
the
figure
is
there
still
feeling
for
an
entrance
and
clattering
against
the
glass
with
its
long
nails
that
appear
as
if
the
growth
of
many
years
had
been
untouched
she
tries
to
scream
again
but
a
choking
sensation
comes
over
her
and
she
cannot
it
is
too
dreadful--she
tries
to
move--each
limb
seems
weighed
down
by
tons
of
lead--she
can
but
in
a
hoarse
faint
whisper
cry--
help--help--help--help
and
that
one
word
she
repeats
like
a
person
in
a
dream
the
red
glare
of
the
fire
continues
it
throws
up
the
tall
gaunt
figure
in
hideous
relief
against
the
long
window
it
shows
too
upon
the
one
portrait
that
is
in
the
chamber
and
that
portrait
appears
to
fix
its
eyes
upon
the
attempting
intruder
while
the
flickering
light
from
the
fire
makes
it
look
fearfully
life-like
a
small
pane
of
glass
is
broken
and
the
form
from
without
introduces
a
long
gaunt
hand
which
seems
utterly
destitute
of
flesh
the
fastening
is
removed
and
one-half
of
the
window
which
opens
like
folding
doors
is
swung
wide
open
upon
its
hinges
and
yet
now
she
could
not
scream--she
could
not
move
help--help--help
was
all
she
could
say
but
oh
that
look
of
terror
that
sat
upon
her
face
it
was
dreadful--a
look
to
haunt
the
memory
for
a
lifetime--a
look
to
obtrude
itself
upon
the
happiest
moments
and
turn
them
to
bitterness
the
figure
turns
half
round
and
the
light
falls
upon
the
face
it
is
perfectly
white--perfectly
bloodless
the
eyes
look
like
polished
tin
the
lips
are
drawn
back
and
the
principal
feature
next
to
those
dreadful
eyes
is
the
teeth--the
fearful
looking
teeth--projecting
like
those
of
some
wild
animal
hideously
glaringly
white
and
fang-like
it
approaches
the
bed
with
a
strange
gliding
movement
it
clashes
together
the
long
nails
that
literally
appear
to
hang
from
the
finger
ends
no
sound
comes
from
its
lips
is
she
going
mad--that
young
and
beautiful
girl
exposed
to
so
much
terror
she
has
drawn
up
all
her
limbs
she
cannot
even
now
say
help
the
power
of
articulation
is
gone
but
the
power
of
movement
has
returned
to
her
she
can
draw
herself
slowly
along
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
from
that
towards
which
the
hideous
appearance
is
coming
but
her
eyes
are
fascinated
the
glance
of
a
serpent
could
not
have
produced
a
greater
effect
upon
her
than
did
the
fixed
gaze
of
those
awful
metallic-looking
eyes
that
were
bent
on
her
face
crouching
down
so
that
the
gigantic
height
was
lost
and
the
horrible
protruding
white
face
was
the
most
prominent
object
came
on
the
figure
what
was
it--what
did
it
want
there--what
made
it
look
so
hideous--so
unlike
an
inhabitant
of
the
earth
and
yet
to
be
on
it
now
she
has
got
to
the
verge
of
the
bed
and
the
figure
pauses
it
seemed
as
if
when
it
paused
she
lost
the
power
to
proceed
the
clothing
of
the
bed
was
now
clutched
in
her
hands
with
unconscious
power
she
drew
her
breath
short
and
thick
her
bosom
heaves
and
her
limbs
tremble
yet
she
cannot
withdraw
her
eyes
from
that
marble-looking
face
he
holds
her
with
his
glittering
eye
the
storm
has
ceased--all
is
still
the
winds
are
hushed
the
church
clock
proclaims
the
hour
of
one
a
hissing
sound
comes
from
the
throat
of
the
hideous
being
and
he
raises
his
long
gaunt
arms--the
lips
move
he
advances
the
girl
places
one
small
foot
from
the
bed
on
to
the
floor
she
is
unconsciously
dragging
the
clothing
with
her
the
door
of
the
room
is
in
that
direction--can
she
reach
it
has
she
power
to
walk--can
she
withdraw
her
eyes
from
the
face
of
the
intruder
and
so
break
the
hideous
charm
god
of
heaven
is
it
real
or
some
dream
so
like
reality
as
to
nearly
overturn
the
judgment
for
ever
the
figure
has
paused
again
and
half
on
the
bed
and
half
out
of
it
that
young
girl
lies
trembling
her
long
hair
streams
across
the
entire
width
of
the
bed
as
she
has
slowly
moved
along
she
has
left
it
streaming
across
the
pillows
the
pause
lasted
about
a
minute--oh
what
an
age
of
agony
that
minute
was
indeed
enough
for
madness
to
do
its
full
work
in
with
a
sudden
rush
that
could
not
be
foreseen--with
a
strange
howling
cry
that
was
enough
to
awaken
terror
in
every
breast
the
figure
seized
the
long
tresses
of
her
hair
and
twining
them
round
his
bony
hands
he
held
her
to
the
bed
then
she
screamed--heaven
granted
her
then
power
to
scream
shriek
followed
shriek
in
rapid
succession
the
bed-clothes
fell
in
a
heap
by
the
side
of
the
bed--she
was
dragged
by
her
long
silken
hair
completely
on
to
it
again
her
beautifully
rounded
limbs
quivered
with
the
agony
of
her
soul
the
glassy
horrible
eyes
of
the
figure
ran
over
that
angelic
form
with
a
hideous
satisfaction--horrible
profanation
he
drags
her
head
to
the
bed's
edge
he
forces
it
back
by
the
long
hair
still
entwined
in
his
grasp
with
a
plunge
he
seizes
her
neck
in
his
fang-like
teeth--a
gush
of
blood
and
a
hideous
sucking
noise
follows
the
girl
has
swooned
and
the
vampyre
is
at
his
hideous
repast
the
alarm--the
pistol
shot--the
pursuit
and
its
consequences
illustration
lights
flashed
about
the
building
and
various
room
doors
opened
voices
called
one
to
the
other
there
was
an
universal
stir
and
commotion
among
the
inhabitants
did
you
hear
a
scream
harry
asked
a
young
man
half-dressed
as
he
walked
into
the
chamber
of
another
about
his
own
age
i
did--where
was
it
god
knows
i
dressed
myself
directly
all
is
still
now
yes
but
unless
i
was
dreaming
there
was
a
scream
we
could
not
both
dream
there
was
where
did
you
think
it
came
from
it
burst
so
suddenly
upon
my
ears
that
i
cannot
say
there
was
a
tap
now
at
the
door
of
the
room
where
these
young
men
were
and
a
female
voice
said--
for
god's
sake
get
up
we
are
up
said
both
the
young
men
appearing
did
you
hear
anything
yes
a
scream
oh
search
the
house--search
the
house
where
did
it
come
from--can
you
tell
indeed
we
cannot
mother
another
person
now
joined
the
party
he
was
a
man
of
middle
age
and
as
he
came
up
to
them
he
said--
good
god
what
is
the
matter
scarcely
had
the
words
passed
his
lips
than
such
a
rapid
succession
of
shrieks
came
upon
their
ears
that
they
felt
absolutely
stunned
by
them
the
elderly
lady
whom
one
of
the
young
men
had
called
mother
fainted
and
would
have
fallen
to
the
floor
of
the
corridor
in
which
they
all
stood
had
she
not
been
promptly
supported
by
the
last
comer
who
himself
staggered
as
those
piercing
cries
came
upon
the
night
air
he
however
was
the
first
to
recover
for
the
young
men
seemed
paralysed
henry
he
cried
for
god's
sake
support
your
mother
can
you
doubt
that
these
cries
come
from
flora's
room
the
young
man
mechanically
supported
his
mother
and
then
the
man
who
had
just
spoken
darted
back
to
his
own
bed-room
from
whence
he
returned
in
a
moment
with
a
pair
of
pistols
and
shouting--
follow
me
who
can
he
bounded
across
the
corridor
in
the
direction
of
the
antique
apartment
from
whence
the
cries
proceeded
but
which
were
now
hushed
that
house
was
built
for
strength
and
the
doors
were
all
of
oak
and
of
considerable
thickness
unhappily
they
had
fastenings
within
so
that
when
the
man
reached
the
chamber
of
her
who
so
much
required
help
he
was
helpless
for
the
door
was
fast
flora
flora
he
cried
flora
speak
all
was
still
good
god
he
added
we
must
force
the
door
i
hear
a
strange
noise
within
said
the
young
man
who
trembled
violently
and
so
do
i
what
does
it
sound
like
i
scarcely
know
but
it
nearest
resembles
some
animal
eating
or
sucking
some
liquid
what
on
earth
can
it
be
have
you
no
weapon
that
will
force
the
door
i
shall
go
mad
if
i
am
kept
here
i
have
said
the
young
man
wait
here
a
moment
he
ran
down
the
staircase
and
presently
returned
with
a
small
but
powerful
iron
crow-bar
this
will
do
he
said
it
will
it
will--give
it
to
me
has
she
not
spoken
not
a
word
my
mind
misgives
me
that
something
very
dreadful
must
have
happened
to
her
and
that
odd
noise
still
goes
on
somehow
it
curdles
the
very
blood
in
my
veins
to
hear
it
the
man
took
the
crow-bar
and
with
some
difficulty
succeeded
in
introducing
it
between
the
door
and
the
side
of
the
wall--still
it
required
great
strength
to
move
it
but
it
did
move
with
a
harsh
crackling
sound
push
it
cried
he
who
was
using
the
bar
push
the
door
at
the
same
time
the
younger
man
did
so
for
a
few
moments
the
massive
door
resisted
then
suddenly
something
gave
way
with
a
loud
snap--it
was
a
part
of
the
lock--and
the
door
at
once
swung
wide
open
how
true
it
is
that
we
measure
time
by
the
events
which
happen
within
a
given
space
of
it
rather
than
by
its
actual
duration
to
those
who
were
engaged
in
forcing
open
the
door
of
the
antique
chamber
where
slept
the
young
girl
whom
they
named
flora
each
moment
was
swelled
into
an
hour
of
agony
but
in
reality
from
the
first
moment
of
the
alarm
to
that
when
the
loud
cracking
noise
heralded
the
destruction
of
the
fastenings
of
the
door
there
had
elapsed
but
very
few
minutes
indeed
it
opens--it
opens
cried
the
young
man
another
moment
said
the
stranger
as
he
still
plied
the
crowbar--another
moment
and
we
shall
have
free
ingress
to
the
chamber
be
patient
this
stranger's
name
was
marchdale
and
even
as
he
spoke
he
succeeded
in
throwing
the
massive
door
wide
open
and
clearing
the
passage
to
the
chamber
to
rush
in
with
a
light
in
his
hand
was
the
work
of
a
moment
to
the
young
man
named
henry
but
the
very
rapid
progress
he
made
into
the
apartment
prevented
him
from
observing
accurately
what
it
contained
for
the
wind
that
came
in
from
the
open
window
caught
the
flame
of
the
candle
and
although
it
did
not
actually
extinguish
it
it
blew
it
so
much
on
one
side
that
it
was
comparatively
useless
as
a
light
flora--flora
he
cried
then
with
a
sudden
bound
something
dashed
from
off
the
bed
the
concussion
against
him
was
so
sudden
and
so
utterly
unexpected
as
well
as
so
tremendously
violent
that
he
was
thrown
down
and
in
his
fall
the
light
was
fairly
extinguished
all
was
darkness
save
a
dull
reddish
kind
of
light
that
now
and
then
from
the
nearly
consumed
mill
in
the
immediate
vicinity
came
into
the
room
but
by
that
light
dim
uncertain
and
flickering
as
it
was
some
one
was
seen
to
make
for
the
window
henry
although
nearly
stunned
by
his
fall
saw
a
figure
gigantic
in
height
which
nearly
reached
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
the
other
young
man
george
saw
it
and
mr
marchdale
likewise
saw
it
as
did
the
lady
who
had
spoken
to
the
two
young
men
in
the
corridor
when
first
the
screams
of
the
young
girl
awakened
alarm
in
the
breasts
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
that
house
the
figure
was
about
to
pass
out
at
the
window
which
led
to
a
kind
of
balcony
from
whence
there
was
an
easy
descent
to
a
garden
before
it
passed
out
they
each
and
all
caught
a
glance
of
the
side-face
and
they
saw
that
the
lower
part
of
it
and
the
lips
were
dabbled
in
blood
they
saw
too
one
of
those
fearful-looking
shining
metallic
eyes
which
presented
so
terrible
an
appearance
of
unearthly
ferocity
no
wonder
that
for
a
moment
a
panic
seized
them
all
which
paralysed
any
exertions
they
might
otherwise
have
made
to
detain
that
hideous
form
but
mr
marchdale
was
a
man
of
mature
years
he
had
seen
much
of
life
both
in
this
and
in
foreign
lands
and
he
although
astonished
to
the
extent
of
being
frightened
was
much
more
likely
to
recover
sooner
than
his
younger
companions
which
indeed
he
did
and
acted
promptly
enough
don't
rise
henry
he
cried
lie
still
almost
at
the
moment
he
uttered
these
words
he
fired
at
the
figure
which
then
occupied
the
window
as
if
it
were
a
gigantic
figure
set
in
a
frame
the
report
was
tremendous
in
that
chamber
for
the
pistol
was
no
toy
weapon
but
one
made
for
actual
service
and
of
sufficient
length
and
bore
of
barrel
to
carry
destruction
along
with
the
bullets
that
came
from
it
if
that
has
missed
its
aim
said
mr
marchdale
i'll
never
pull
a
trigger
again
as
he
spoke
he
dashed
forward
and
made
a
clutch
at
the
figure
he
felt
convinced
he
had
shot
the
tall
form
turned
upon
him
and
when
he
got
a
full
view
of
the
face
which
he
did
at
that
moment
from
the
opportune
circumstance
of
the
lady
returning
at
the
instant
with
a
light
she
had
been
to
her
own
chamber
to
procure
even
he
marchdale
with
all
his
courage
and
that
was
great
and
all
his
nervous
energy
recoiled
a
step
or
two
and
uttered
the
exclamation
of
great
god
that
face
was
one
never
to
be
forgotten
it
was
hideously
flushed
with
colour--the
colour
of
fresh
blood
the
eyes
had
a
savage
and
remarkable
lustre
whereas
before
they
had
looked
like
polished
tin--they
now
wore
a
ten
times
brighter
aspect
and
flashes
of
light
seemed
to
dart
from
them
the
mouth
was
open
as
if
from
the
natural
formation
of
the
countenance
the
lips
receded
much
from
the
large
canine
looking
teeth
a
strange
howling
noise
came
from
the
throat
of
this
monstrous
figure
and
it
seemed
upon
the
point
of
rushing
upon
mr
marchdale
suddenly
then
as
if
some
impulse
had
seized
upon
it
it
uttered
a
wild
and
terrible
shrieking
kind
of
laugh
and
then
turning
dashed
through
the
window
and
in
one
instant
disappeared
from
before
the
eyes
of
those
who
felt
nearly
annihilated
by
its
fearful
presence
god
help
us
ejaculated
henry
mr
marchdale
drew
a
long
breath
and
then
giving
a
stamp
on
the
floor
as
if
to
recover
himself
from
the
state
of
agitation
into
which
even
he
was
thrown
he
cried--
be
it
what
or
who
it
may
i'll
follow
it
no--no--do
not
cried
the
lady
i
must
i
will
let
who
will
come
with
me--i
follow
that
dreadful
form
as
he
spoke
he
took
the
road
it
took
and
dashed
through
the
window
into
the
balcony
and
we
too
george
exclaimed
henry
we
will
follow
mr
marchdale
this
dreadful
affair
concerns
us
more
nearly
than
it
does
him
the
lady
who
was
the
mother
of
these
young
men
and
of
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
been
so
awfully
visited
screamed
aloud
and
implored
of
them
to
stay
but
the
voice
of
mr
marchdale
was
heard
exclaiming
aloud--
i
see
it--i
see
it
it
makes
for
the
wall
they
hesitated
no
longer
but
at
once
rushed
into
the
balcony
and
from
thence
dropped
into
the
garden
the
mother
approached
the
bed-side
of
the
insensible
perhaps
the
murdered
girl
she
saw
her
to
all
appearance
weltering
in
blood
and
overcome
by
her
emotions
she
fainted
on
the
floor
of
the
room
when
the
two
young
men
reached
the
garden
they
found
it
much
lighter
than
might
have
been
fairly
expected
for
not
only
was
the
morning
rapidly
approaching
but
the
mill
was
still
burning
and
those
mingled
lights
made
almost
every
object
plainly
visible
except
when
deep
shadows
were
thrown
from
some
gigantic
trees
that
had
stood
for
centuries
in
that
sweetly
wooded
spot
they
heard
the
voice
of
mr
marchdale
as
he
cried--
there--there--towards
the
wall
there--there--god
how
it
bounds
along
the
young
men
hastily
dashed
through
a
thicket
in
the
direction
from
whence
his
voice
sounded
and
then
they
found
him
looking
wild
and
terrified
and
with
something
in
his
hand
which
looked
like
a
portion
of
clothing
which
way
which
way
they
both
cried
in
a
breath
he
leant
heavily
on
the
arm
of
george
as
he
pointed
along
a
vista
of
trees
and
said
in
a
low
voice--
god
help
us
all
it
is
not
human
look
there--look
there--do
you
not
see
it
they
looked
in
the
direction
he
indicated
at
the
end
of
this
vista
was
the
wall
of
the
garden
at
that
point
it
was
full
twelve
feet
in
height
and
as
they
looked
they
saw
the
hideous
monstrous
form
they
had
traced
from
the
chamber
of
their
sister
making
frantic
efforts
to
clear
the
obstacle
then
they
saw
it
bound
from
the
ground
to
the
top
of
the
wall
which
it
very
nearly
reached
and
then
each
time
it
fell
back
again
into
the
garden
with
such
a
dull
heavy
sound
that
the
earth
seemed
to
shake
again
with
the
concussion
they
trembled--well
indeed
they
might
and
for
some
minutes
they
watched
the
figure
making
its
fruitless
efforts
to
leave
the
place
what--what
is
it
whispered
henry
in
hoarse
accents
god
what
can
it
possibly
be
i
know
not
replied
mr
marchdale
i
did
seize
it
it
was
cold
and
clammy
like
a
corpse
it
cannot
be
human
not
human
look
at
it
now
it
will
surely
escape
now
no
no--we
will
not
be
terrified
thus--there
is
heaven
above
us
come
on
and
for
dear
flora's
sake
let
us
make
an
effort
yet
to
seize
this
bold
intruder
take
this
pistol
said
marchdale
it
is
the
fellow
of
the
one
i
fired
try
its
efficacy
he
will
be
gone
exclaimed
henry
as
at
this
moment
after
many
repeated
attempts
and
fearful
falls
the
figure
reached
the
top
of
the
wall
and
then
hung
by
its
long
arms
a
moment
or
two
previous
to
dragging
itself
completely
up
the
idea
of
the
appearance
be
it
what
it
might
entirely
escaping
seemed
to
nerve
again
mr
marchdale
and
he
as
well
as
the
two
young
men
ran
forward
towards
the
wall
they
got
so
close
to
the
figure
before
it
sprang
down
on
the
outer
side
of
the
wall
that
to
miss
killing
it
with
the
bullet
from
the
pistol
was
a
matter
of
utter
impossibility
unless
wilfully
henry
had
the
weapon
and
he
pointed
it
full
at
the
tall
form
with
a
steady
aim
he
pulled
the
trigger--the
explosion
followed
and
that
the
bullet
did
its
office
there
could
be
no
manner
of
doubt
for
the
figure
gave
a
howling
shriek
and
fell
headlong
from
the
wall
on
the
outside
i
have
shot
him
cried
henry
i
have
shot
him
the
disappearance
of
the
body--flora's
recovery
and
madness--the
offer
of
assistance
from
sir
francis
varney
illustration
he
is
human
cried
henry
i
have
surely
killed
him
it
would
seem
so
said
mr
marchdale
let
us
now
hurry
round
to
the
outside
of
the
wall
and
see
where
he
lies
this
was
at
once
agreed
to
and
the
whole
three
of
them
made
what
expedition
they
could
towards
a
gate
which
led
into
a
paddock
across
which
they
hurried
and
soon
found
themselves
clear
of
the
garden
wall
so
that
they
could
make
way
towards
where
they
fully
expected
to
find
the
body
of
him
who
had
worn
so
unearthly
an
aspect
but
who
it
would
be
an
excessive
relief
to
find
was
human
so
hurried
was
the
progress
they
made
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
exchange
many
words
as
they
went
a
kind
of
breathless
anxiety
was
upon
them
and
in
the
speed
they
disregarded
every
obstacle
which
would
at
any
other
time
have
probably
prevented
them
from
taking
the
direct
road
they
sought
it
was
difficult
on
the
outside
of
the
wall
to
say
exactly
which
was
the
precise
spot
which
it
might
be
supposed
the
body
had
fallen
on
but
by
following
the
wall
in
its
entire
length
surely
they
would
come
upon
it
they
did
so
but
to
their
surprise
they
got
from
its
commencement
to
its
further
extremity
without
finding
any
dead
body
or
even
any
symptoms
of
one
having
lain
there
at
some
parts
close
to
the
wall
there
grew
a
kind
of
heath
and
consequently
the
traces
of
blood
would
be
lost
among
it
if
it
so
happened
that
at
the
precise
spot
at
which
the
strange
being
had
seemed
to
topple
over
such
vegetation
had
existed
this
was
to
be
ascertained
but
now
after
traversing
the
whole
length
of
the
wall
twice
they
came
to
a
halt
and
looked
wonderingly
in
each
other's
faces
there
is
nothing
here
said
harry
nothing
added
his
brother
it
could
not
have
been
a
delusion
at
length
said
mr
marchdale
with
a
shudder
a
delusion
exclaimed
the
brother
that
is
not
possible
we
all
saw
it
then
what
terrible
explanation
can
we
give
by
heavens
i
know
not
exclaimed
henry
this
adventure
surpasses
all
belief
and
but
for
the
great
interest
we
have
in
it
i
should
regard
it
with
a
world
of
curiosity
it
is
too
dreadful
said
george
for
god's
sake
henry
let
us
return
to
ascertain
if
poor
flora
is
killed
my
senses
said
henry
were
all
so
much
absorbed
in
gazing
at
that
horrible
form
that
i
never
once
looked
towards
her
further
than
to
see
that
she
was
to
appearance
dead
god
help
her
poor--poor
beautiful
flora
this
is
indeed
a
sad
sad
fate
for
you
to
come
to
flora--flora--
do
not
weep
henry
said
george
rather
let
us
now
hasten
home
where
we
may
find
that
tears
are
premature
she
may
yet
be
living
and
restored
to
us
and
said
mr
marchdale
she
may
be
able
to
give
us
some
account
of
this
dreadful
visitation
true--true
exclaimed
henry
we
will
hasten
home
they
now
turned
their
steps
homeward
and
as
they
went
they
much
blamed
themselves
for
all
leaving
home
together
and
with
terror
pictured
what
might
occur
in
their
absence
to
those
who
were
now
totally
unprotected
it
was
a
rash
impulse
of
us
all
to
come
in
pursuit
of
this
dreadful
figure
remarked
mr
marchdale
but
do
not
torment
yourself
henry
there
may
be
no
reason
for
your
fears
at
the
pace
they
went
they
very
soon
reached
the
ancient
house
and
when
they
came
in
sight
of
it
they
saw
lights
flashing
from
the
windows
and
the
shadows
of
faces
moving
to
and
fro
indicating
that
the
whole
household
was
up
and
in
a
state
of
alarm
henry
after
some
trouble
got
the
hall
door
opened
by
a
terrified
servant
who
was
trembling
so
much
that
she
could
scarcely
hold
the
light
she
had
with
her
speak
at
once
martha
said
henry
is
flora
living
yes
but--
enough--enough
thank
god
she
lives
where
is
she
now
in
her
own
room
master
henry
oh
dear--oh
dear
what
will
become
of
us
all
henry
rushed
up
the
staircase
followed
by
george
and
mr
marchdale
nor
paused
he
once
until
he
reached
the
room
of
his
sister
mother
he
said
before
he
crossed
the
threshold
are
you
here
i
am
my
dear--i
am
come
in
pray
come
in
and
speak
to
poor
flora
come
in
mr
marchdale
said
henry--come
in
we
make
no
stranger
of
you
they
all
then
entered
the
room
several
lights
had
been
now
brought
into
that
antique
chamber
and
in
addition
to
the
mother
of
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
been
so
fearfully
visited
there
were
two
female
domestics
who
appeared
to
be
in
the
greatest
possible
fright
for
they
could
render
no
assistance
whatever
to
anybody
the
tears
were
streaming
down
the
mother's
face
and
the
moment
she
saw
mr
marchdale
she
clung
to
his
arm
evidently
unconscious
of
what
she
was
about
and
exclaimed--
oh
what
is
this
that
has
happened--what
is
this
tell
me
marchdale
robert
marchdale
you
whom
i
have
known
even
from
my
childhood
you
will
not
deceive
me
tell
me
the
meaning
of
all
this
i
cannot
he
said
in
a
tone
of
much
emotion
as
god
is
my
judge
i
am
as
much
puzzled
and
amazed
at
the
scene
that
has
taken
place
here
to-night
as
you
can
be
the
mother
wrung
her
hands
and
wept
it
was
the
storm
that
first
awakened
me
added
marchdale
and
then
i
heard
a
scream
the
brothers
tremblingly
approached
the
bed
flora
was
placed
in
a
sitting
half-reclining
posture
propped
up
by
pillows
she
was
quite
insensible
and
her
face
was
fearfully
pale
while
that
she
breathed
at
all
could
be
but
very
faintly
seen
on
some
of
her
clothing
about
the
neck
were
spots
of
blood
and
she
looked
more
like
one
who
had
suffered
some
long
and
grievous
illness
than
a
young
girl
in
the
prime
of
life
and
in
the
most
robust
health
as
she
had
been
on
the
day
previous
to
the
strange
scene
we
have
recorded
does
she
sleep
said
henry
as
a
tear
fell
from
his
eyes
upon
her
pallid
cheek
no
replied
mr
marchdale
this
is
a
swoon
from
which
we
must
recover
her
active
measures
were
now
adopted
to
restore
the
languid
circulation
and
after
persevering
in
them
for
some
time
they
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
open
her
eyes
her
first
act
upon
consciousness
returning
however
was
to
utter
a
loud
shriek
and
it
was
not
until
henry
implored
her
to
look
around
her
and
see
that
she
was
surrounded
by
none
but
friendly
faces
that
she
would
venture
again
to
open
her
eyes
and
look
timidly
from
one
to
the
other
then
she
shuddered
and
burst
into
tears
as
she
said--
oh
heaven
have
mercy
upon
me--heaven
have
mercy
upon
me
and
save
me
from
that
dreadful
form
there
is
no
one
here
flora
said
mr
marchdale
but
those
who
love
you
and
who
in
defence
of
you
if
needs
were
would
lay
down
their
lives
oh
god
oh
god
you
have
been
terrified
but
tell
us
distinctly
what
has
happened
you
are
quite
safe
now
illustration
she
trembled
so
violently
that
mr
marchdale
recommended
that
some
stimulant
should
be
given
to
her
and
she
was
persuaded
although
not
without
considerable
difficulty
to
swallow
a
small
portion
of
some
wine
from
a
cup
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
that
the
stimulating
effect
of
the
wine
was
beneficial
for
a
slight
accession
of
colour
visited
her
cheeks
and
she
spoke
in
a
firmer
tone
as
she
said--
do
not
leave
me
oh
do
not
leave
me
any
of
you
i
shall
die
if
left
alone
now
oh
save
me--save
me
that
horrible
form
that
fearful
face
tell
us
how
it
happened
dear
flora
said
henry
or
would
you
rather
endeavour
to
get
some
sleep
first
suggested
mr
marchdale
no--no--no
she
said
i
do
not
think
i
shall
ever
sleep
again
say
not
so
you
will
be
more
composed
in
a
few
hours
and
then
you
can
tell
us
what
has
occurred
i
will
tell
you
now
i
will
tell
you
now
she
placed
her
hands
over
her
face
for
a
moment
as
if
to
collect
her
scattered
thoughts
and
then
she
added--
i
was
awakened
by
the
storm
and
i
saw
that
terrible
apparition
at
the
window
i
think
i
screamed
but
i
could
not
fly
oh
god
i
could
not
fly
it
came--it
seized
me
by
the
hair
i
know
no
more
i
know
no
more
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
neck
several
times
and
mr
marchdale
said
in
an
anxious
voice--
you
seem
flora
to
have
hurt
your
neck--there
is
a
wound
a
wound
said
the
mother
and
she
brought
a
light
close
to
the
bed
where
all
saw
on
the
side
of
flora's
neck
a
small
punctured
wound
or
rather
two
for
there
was
one
a
little
distance
from
the
other
it
was
from
these
wounds
the
blood
had
come
which
was
observable
upon
her
night
clothing
how
came
these
wounds
said
henry
i
do
not
know
she
replied
i
feel
very
faint
and
weak
as
if
i
had
almost
bled
to
death
you
cannot
have
done
so
dear
flora
for
there
are
not
above
half-a-dozen
spots
of
blood
to
be
seen
at
all
mr
marchdale
leaned
against
the
carved
head
of
the
bed
for
support
and
he
uttered
a
deep
groan
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
him
and
henry
said
in
a
voice
of
the
most
anxious
inquiry--
you
have
something
to
say
mr
marchdale
which
will
throw
some
light
upon
this
affair
no
no
no
nothing
cried
mr
marchdale
rousing
himself
at
once
from
the
appearance
of
depression
that
had
come
over
him
i
have
nothing
to
say
but
that
i
think
flora
had
better
get
some
sleep
if
she
can
no
sleep-no
sleep
for
me
again
screamed
flora
dare
i
be
alone
to
sleep
but
you
shall
not
be
alone
dear
flora
said
henry
i
will
sit
by
your
bedside
and
watch
you
she
took
his
hand
in
both
hers
and
while
the
tears
chased
each
other
down
her
cheeks
she
said--
promise
me
henry
by
all
your
hopes
of
heaven
you
will
not
leave
me
i
promise
she
gently
laid
herself
down
with
a
deep
sigh
and
closed
her
eyes
she
is
weak
and
will
sleep
long
said
mr
marchdale
you
sigh
said
henry
some
fearful
thoughts
i
feel
certain
oppress
your
heart
hush-hush
said
mr
marchdale
as
he
pointed
to
flora
hush
not
here--not
here
i
understand
said
henry
let
her
sleep
there
was
a
silence
of
some
few
minutes
duration
flora
had
dropped
into
a
deep
slumber
that
silence
was
first
broken
by
george
who
said--
mr
marchdale
look
at
that
portrait
he
pointed
to
the
portrait
in
the
frame
to
which
we
have
alluded
and
the
moment
marchdale
looked
at
it
he
sunk
into
a
chair
as
he
exclaimed--
gracious
heaven
how
like
it
is--it
is
said
henry
those
eyes--
and
see
the
contour
of
the
countenance
and
the
strange
shape
of
the
mouth
exact--exact
that
picture
shall
be
moved
from
here
the
sight
of
it
is
at
once
sufficient
to
awaken
all
her
former
terrors
in
poor
flora's
brain
if
she
should
chance
to
awaken
and
cast
her
eyes
suddenly
upon
it
and
is
it
so
like
him
who
came
here
said
the
mother
it
is
the
very
man
himself
said
mr
marchdale
i
have
not
been
in
this
house
long
enough
to
ask
any
of
you
whose
portrait
that
may
be
it
is
said
henry
the
portrait
of
sir
runnagate
bannerworth
an
ancestor
of
ours
who
first
by
his
vices
gave
the
great
blow
to
the
family
prosperity
indeed
how
long
ago
about
ninety
years
ninety
years
'tis
a
long
while--ninety
years
you
muse
upon
it
no
no
i
do
wish
and
yet
i
dread--
what
to
say
something
to
you
all
but
not
here--not
here
we
will
hold
a
consultation
on
this
matter
to-morrow
not
now--not
now
the
daylight
is
coming
quickly
on
said
henry
i
shall
keep
my
sacred
promise
of
not
moving
from
this
room
until
flora
awakens
but
there
can
be
no
occasion
for
the
detention
of
any
of
you
one
is
sufficient
here
go
all
of
you
and
endeavour
to
procure
what
rest
you
can
i
will
fetch
you
my
powder-flask
and
bullets
said
mr
marchdale
and
you
can
if
you
please
reload
the
pistols
in
about
two
hours
more
it
will
be
broad
daylight
this
arrangement
was
adopted
henry
did
reload
the
pistols
and
placed
them
on
a
table
by
the
side
of
the
bed
ready
for
immediate
action
and
then
as
flora
was
sleeping
soundly
all
left
the
room
but
himself
mrs
bannerworth
was
the
last
to
do
so
she
would
have
remained
but
for
the
earnest
solicitation
of
henry
that
she
would
endeavour
to
get
some
sleep
to
make
up
for
her
broken
night's
repose
and
she
was
indeed
so
broken
down
by
her
alarm
on
flora's
account
that
she
had
not
power
to
resist
but
with
tears
flowing
from
her
eyes
she
sought
her
own
chamber
and
now
the
calmness
of
the
night
resumed
its
sway
in
that
evil-fated
mansion
and
although
no
one
really
slept
but
flora
all
were
still
busy
thought
kept
every
one
else
wakeful
it
was
a
mockery
to
lie
down
at
all
and
henry
full
of
strange
and
painful
feelings
as
he
was
preferred
his
present
position
to
the
anxiety
and
apprehension
on
flora's
account
which
he
knew
he
should
feel
if
she
were
not
within
the
sphere
of
his
own
observation
and
she
slept
as
soundly
as
some
gentle
infant
tired
of
its
playmates
and
its
sports
the
morning--the
consultation--the
fearful
suggestion
illustration
what
wonderfully
different
impressions
and
feelings
with
regard
to
the
same
circumstances
come
across
the
mind
in
the
broad
clear
and
beautiful
light
of
day
to
what
haunt
the
imagination
and
often
render
the
judgment
almost
incapable
of
action
when
the
heavy
shadow
of
night
is
upon
all
things
there
must
be
a
downright
physical
reason
for
this
effect--it
is
so
remarkable
and
so
universal
it
seems
that
the
sun's
rays
so
completely
alter
and
modify
the
constitution
of
the
atmosphere
that
it
produces
as
we
inhale
it
a
wonderfully
different
effect
upon
the
nerves
of
the
human
subject
we
can
account
for
this
phenomenon
in
no
other
way
perhaps
never
in
his
life
had
he
henry
bannerworth
felt
so
strongly
this
transition
of
feeling
as
he
now
felt
it
when
the
beautiful
daylight
gradually
dawned
upon
him
as
he
kept
his
lonely
watch
by
the
bedside
of
his
slumbering
sister
that
watch
had
been
a
perfectly
undisturbed
one
not
the
least
sight
or
sound
of
any
intrusion
had
reached
his
senses
all
had
been
as
still
as
the
very
grave
and
yet
while
the
night
lasted
and
he
was
more
indebted
to
the
rays
of
the
candle
which
he
had
placed
upon
a
shelf
for
the
power
to
distinguish
objects
than
to
the
light
of
the
morning
a
thousand
uneasy
and
strange
sensations
had
found
a
home
in
his
agitated
bosom
he
looked
so
many
times
at
the
portrait
which
was
in
the
panel
that
at
length
he
felt
an
undefined
sensation
of
terror
creep
over
him
whenever
he
took
his
eyes
off
it
he
tried
to
keep
himself
from
looking
at
it
but
he
found
it
vain
so
he
adopted
what
perhaps
was
certainly
the
wisest
best
plan
namely
to
look
at
it
continually
he
shifted
his
chair
so
that
he
could
gaze
upon
it
without
any
effort
and
he
placed
the
candle
so
that
a
faint
light
was
thrown
upon
it
and
there
he
sat
a
prey
to
many
conflicting
and
uncomfortable
feelings
until
the
daylight
began
to
make
the
candle
flame
look
dull
and
sickly
solution
for
the
events
of
the
night
he
could
find
none
he
racked
his
imagination
in
vain
to
find
some
means
however
vague
of
endeavouring
to
account
for
what
occurred
and
still
he
was
at
fault
all
was
to
him
wrapped
in
the
gloom
of
the
most
profound
mystery
and
how
strangely
too
the
eyes
of
that
portrait
appeared
to
look
upon
him--as
if
instinct
with
life
and
as
if
the
head
to
which
they
belonged
was
busy
in
endeavouring
to
find
out
the
secret
communings
of
his
soul
it
was
wonderfully
well
executed
that
portrait
so
life-like
that
the
very
features
seemed
to
move
as
you
gazed
upon
them
it
shall
be
removed
said
henry
i
would
remove
it
now
but
that
it
seems
absolutely
painted
on
the
panel
and
i
should
awake
flora
in
any
attempt
to
do
so
he
arose
and
ascertained
that
such
was
the
case
and
that
it
would
require
a
workman
with
proper
tools
adapted
to
the
job
to
remove
the
portrait
true
he
said
i
might
now
destroy
it
but
it
is
a
pity
to
obscure
a
work
of
such
rare
art
as
this
is
i
should
blame
myself
if
i
were
it
shall
be
removed
to
some
other
room
of
the
house
however
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
struck
henry
how
foolish
it
would
be
to
remove
the
portrait
from
the
wall
of
a
room
which
in
all
likelihood
after
that
night
would
be
uninhabited
for
it
was
not
probable
that
flora
would
choose
again
to
inhabit
a
chamber
in
which
she
had
gone
through
so
much
terror
it
can
be
left
where
it
is
he
said
and
we
can
fasten
up
if
we
please
even
the
very
door
of
this
room
so
that
no
one
need
trouble
themselves
any
further
about
it
the
morning
was
now
coming
fast
and
just
as
henry
thought
he
would
partially
draw
a
blind
across
the
window
in
order
to
shield
from
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
the
eyes
of
flora
she
awoke
help--help
she
cried
and
henry
was
by
her
side
in
a
moment
you
are
safe
flora--you
are
safe
he
said
where
is
it
now
she
said
what--what
dear
flora
the
dreadful
apparition
oh
what
have
i
done
to
be
made
thus
perpetually
miserable
think
no
more
of
it
flora
i
must
think
my
brain
is
on
fire
a
million
of
strange
eyes
seem
gazing
on
me
great
heaven
she
raves
said
henry
hark--hark--hark
he
comes
on
the
wings
of
the
storm
oh
it
is
most
horrible--horrible
henry
rang
the
bell
but
not
sufficiently
loudly
to
create
any
alarm
the
sound
reached
the
waking
ear
of
the
mother
who
in
a
few
moments
was
in
the
room
she
has
awakened
said
henry
and
has
spoken
but
she
seems
to
me
to
wander
in
her
discourse
for
god's
sake
soothe
her
and
try
to
bring
her
mind
round
to
its
usual
state
i
will
henry--i
will
and
i
think
mother
if
you
were
to
get
her
out
of
this
room
and
into
some
other
chamber
as
far
removed
from
this
one
as
possible
it
would
tend
to
withdraw
her
mind
from
what
has
occurred
yes
it
shall
be
done
oh
henry
what
was
it--what
do
you
think
it
was
i
am
lost
in
a
sea
of
wild
conjecture
i
can
form
no
conclusion
where
is
mr
marchdale
i
believe
in
his
chamber
then
i
will
go
and
consult
with
him
henry
proceeded
at
once
to
the
chamber
which
was
as
he
knew
occupied
by
mr
marchdale
and
as
he
crossed
the
corridor
he
could
not
but
pause
a
moment
to
glance
from
a
window
at
the
face
of
nature
as
is
often
the
case
the
terrific
storm
of
the
preceding
evening
had
cleared
the
air
and
rendered
it
deliciously
invigorating
and
life-like
the
weather
had
been
dull
and
there
had
been
for
some
days
a
certain
heaviness
in
the
atmosphere
which
was
now
entirely
removed
the
morning
sun
was
shining
with
uncommon
brilliancy
birds
were
singing
in
every
tree
and
on
every
bush
so
pleasant
so
spirit-stirring
health-giving
a
morning
seldom
had
he
seen
and
the
effect
upon
his
spirits
was
great
although
not
altogether
what
it
might
have
been
had
all
gone
on
as
it
usually
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
at
that
house
the
ordinary
little
casualties
of
evil
fortune
had
certainly
from
time
to
time
in
the
shape
of
illness
and
one
thing
or
another
attacked
the
family
of
the
bannerworths
in
common
with
every
other
family
but
here
suddenly
had
arisen
a
something
at
once
terrible
and
inexplicable
he
found
mr
marchdale
up
and
dressed
and
apparently
in
deep
and
anxious
thought
the
moment
he
saw
henry
he
said--
flora
is
awake
i
presume
yes
but
her
mind
appears
to
be
much
disturbed
from
bodily
weakness
i
dare
say
but
why
should
she
be
bodily
weak
she
was
strong
and
well
ay
as
well
as
she
could
ever
be
in
all
her
life
the
glow
of
youth
and
health
was
on
her
cheeks
is
it
possible
that
in
the
course
of
one
night
she
should
become
bodily
weak
to
such
an
extent
henry
said
mr
marchdale
sadly
sit
down
i
am
not
as
you
know
a
superstitious
man
you
certainly
are
not
and
yet
i
never
in
all
my
life
was
so
absolutely
staggered
as
i
have
been
by
the
occurrences
of
to-night
say
on
there
is
a
frightful
a
hideous
solution
of
them
one
which
every
consideration
will
tend
to
add
strength
to
one
which
i
tremble
to
name
now
although
yesterday
at
this
hour
i
should
have
laughed
it
to
scorn
indeed
yes
it
is
so
tell
no
one
that
which
i
am
about
to
say
to
you
let
the
dreadful
suggestion
remain
with
ourselves
alone
henry
bannerworth
i--i
am
lost
in
wonder
you
promise
me
what--what
that
you
will
not
repeat
my
opinion
to
any
one
i
do
on
your
honour
on
my
honour
i
promise
mr
marchdale
rose
and
proceeding
to
the
door
he
looked
out
to
see
that
there
were
no
listeners
near
having
ascertained
then
that
they
were
quite
alone
he
returned
and
drawing
a
chair
close
to
that
on
which
henry
sat
he
said--
henry
have
you
never
heard
of
a
strange
and
dreadful
superstition
which
in
some
countries
is
extremely
rife
by
which
it
is
supposed
that
there
are
beings
who
never
die
never
die
never
in
a
word
henry
have
you
never
heard
of--of--i
dread
to
pronounce
the
word
speak
it
god
of
heaven
let
me
hear
it
a
vampyre
henry
sprung
to
his
feet
his
whole
frame
quivered
with
emotion
the
drops
of
perspiration
stood
upon
his
brow
as
in
a
strange
hoarse
voice
he
repeated
the
words--
a
vampyre
even
so
one
who
has
to
renew
a
dreadful
existence
by
human
blood--one
who
lives
on
for
ever
and
must
keep
up
such
a
fearful
existence
upon
human
gore--one
who
eats
not
and
drinks
not
as
other
men--a
vampyre
henry
dropped
into
his
seat
and
uttered
a
deep
groan
of
the
most
exquisite
anguish
i
could
echo
that
groan
said
marchdale
but
that
i
am
so
thoroughly
bewildered
i
know
not
what
to
think
good
god--good
god
do
not
too
readily
yield
belief
in
so
dreadful
a
supposition
i
pray
you
yield
belief
exclaimed
henry
as
he
rose
and
lifted
up
one
of
his
hands
above
his
head
no
by
heaven
and
the
great
god
of
all
who
there
rules
i
will
not
easily
believe
aught
so
awful
and
so
monstrous
i
applaud
your
sentiment
henry
not
willingly
would
i
deliver
up
myself
to
so
frightful
a
belief--it
is
too
horrible
i
merely
have
told
you
of
that
which
you
saw
was
on
my
mind
you
have
surely
before
heard
of
such
things
i
have--i
have
i
much
marvel
then
that
the
supposition
did
not
occur
to
you
henry
it
did
not--it
did
not
marchdale
it--it
was
too
dreadful
i
suppose
to
find
a
home
in
my
heart
oh
flora
flora
if
this
horrible
idea
should
once
occur
to
you
reason
cannot
i
am
quite
sure
uphold
you
against
it
let
no
one
presume
to
insinuate
it
to
her
henry
i
would
not
have
it
mentioned
to
her
for
worlds
nor
i--nor
i
good
god
i
shudder
at
the
very
thought--the
mere
possibility
but
there
is
no
possibility
there
can
be
none
i
will
not
believe
it
nor
i
no
by
heaven's
justice
goodness
grace
and
mercy
i
will
not
believe
it
tis
well
sworn
henry
and
now
discarding
the
supposition
that
flora
has
been
visited
by
a
vampyre
let
us
seriously
set
about
endeavouring
if
we
can
to
account
for
what
has
happened
in
this
house
i--i
cannot
now
nay
let
us
examine
the
matter
if
we
can
find
any
natural
explanation
let
us
cling
to
it
henry
as
the
sheet-anchor
of
our
very
souls
do
you
think
you
are
fertile
in
expedients
do
you
think
marchdale
and
for
heaven's
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
our
own
peace
find
out
some
other
way
of
accounting
for
what
has
happened
than
the
hideous
one
you
have
suggested
and
yet
my
pistol
bullets
hurt
him
not
he
has
left
the
tokens
of
his
presence
on
the
neck
of
flora
peace
oh
peace
do
not
i
pray
you
accumulate
reasons
why
i
should
receive
such
a
dismal
awful
superstition
oh
do
not
marchdale
as
you
love
me
you
know
that
my
attachment
to
you
said
marchdale
is
sincere
and
yet
heaven
help
us
his
voice
was
broken
by
grief
as
he
spoke
and
he
turned
aside
his
head
to
hide
the
bursting
tears
that
would
despite
all
his
efforts
show
themselves
in
his
eyes
marchdale
added
henry
after
a
pause
of
some
moments'
duration
i
will
sit
up
to-night
with
my
sister
do--do
think
you
there
is
a
chance
it
may
come
again
i
cannot--i
dare
not
speculate
upon
the
coming
of
so
dreadful
a
visitor
henry
but
i
will
hold
watch
with
you
most
willingly
you
will
marchdale
my
hand
upon
it
come
what
dangers
may
i
will
share
them
with
you
henry
a
thousand
thanks
say
nothing
then
to
george
of
what
we
have
been
talking
about
he
is
of
a
highly
susceptible
nature
and
the
very
idea
of
such
a
thing
would
kill
him
i
will
be
mute
remove
your
sister
to
some
other
chamber
let
me
beg
of
you
henry
the
one
she
now
inhabits
will
always
be
suggestive
of
horrible
thoughts
i
will
and
that
dreadful-looking
portrait
with
its
perfect
likeness
to
him
who
came
last
night
perfect
indeed
do
you
intend
to
remove
it
i
do
not
i
thought
of
doing
so
but
it
is
actually
on
the
panel
in
the
wall
and
i
would
not
willingly
destroy
it
and
it
may
as
well
remain
where
it
is
in
that
chamber
which
i
can
readily
now
believe
will
become
henceforward
a
deserted
one
in
this
house
it
may
well
become
such
who
comes
here
i
hear
a
step
there
was
a
tip
at
the
door
at
this
moment
and
george
made
his
appearance
in
answer
to
the
summons
to
come
in
he
looked
pale
and
ill
his
face
betrayed
how
much
he
had
mentally
suffered
during
that
night
and
almost
directly
he
got
into
the
bed-chamber
he
said--
i
shall
i
am
sure
be
censured
by
you
both
for
what
i
am
going
to
say
but
i
cannot
help
saying
it
nevertheless
for
to
keep
it
to
myself
would
destroy
me
good
god
george
what
is
it
said
mr
marchdale
speak
it
out
said
henry
i
have
been
thinking
of
what
has
occurred
here
and
the
result
of
that
thought
has
been
one
of
the
wildest
suppositions
that
ever
i
thought
i
should
have
to
entertain
have
you
never
heard
of
a
vampyre
henry
sighed
deeply
and
marchdale
was
silent
i
say
a
vampyre
added
george
with
much
excitement
in
his
manner
it
is
a
fearful
a
horrible
supposition
but
our
poor
dear
flora
has
been
visited
by
a
vampyre
and
i
shall
go
completely
mad
he
sat
down
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
he
wept
bitterly
and
abundantly
george
said
henry
when
he
saw
that
the
frantic
grief
had
in
some
measure
abated--be
calm
george
and
endeavour
to
listen
to
me
i
hear
henry
well
then
do
not
suppose
that
you
are
the
only
one
in
this
house
to
whom
so
dreadful
a
superstition
has
occurred
not
the
only
one
no
it
has
occurred
to
mr
marchdale
also
gracious
heaven
he
mentioned
it
to
me
but
we
have
both
agreed
to
repudiate
it
with
horror
to--repudiate--it
yes
george
and
yet--and
yet--
hush
hush
i
know
what
you
would
say
you
would
tell
us
that
our
repudiation
of
it
cannot
affect
the
fact
of
that
we
are
aware
but
yet
will
we
disbelieve
that
which
a
belief
in
would
be
enough
to
drive
us
mad
what
do
you
intend
to
do
to
keep
this
supposition
to
ourselves
in
the
first
place
to
guard
it
most
zealously
from
the
ears
of
flora
do
you
think
she
has
ever
heard
of
vampyres
i
never
heard
her
mention
that
in
all
her
reading
she
had
gathered
even
a
hint
of
such
a
fearful
superstition
if
she
has
we
must
be
guided
by
circumstances
and
do
the
best
we
can
pray
heaven
she
may
not
amen
to
that
prayer
george
said
henry
mr
marchdale
and
i
intend
to
keep
watch
over
flora
to-night
may
not
i
join
you
your
health
dear
george
will
not
permit
you
to
engage
in
such
matters
do
you
seek
your
natural
repose
and
leave
it
to
us
to
do
the
best
we
can
in
this
most
fearful
and
terrible
emergency
as
you
please
brother
and
as
you
please
mr
marchdale
i
know
i
am
a
frail
reed
and
my
belief
is
that
this
affair
will
kill
me
quite
the
truth
is
i
am
horrified--utterly
and
frightfully
horrified
like
my
poor
dear
sister
i
do
not
believe
i
shall
ever
sleep
again
do
not
fancy
that
george
said
marchdale
you
very
much
add
to
the
uneasiness
which
must
be
your
poor
mother's
portion
by
allowing
this
circumstance
to
so
much
affect
you
you
well
know
her
affection
for
you
all
and
let
me
therefore
as
a
very
old
friend
of
hers
entreat
you
to
wear
as
cheerful
an
aspect
as
you
can
in
her
presence
for
once
in
my
life
said
george
sadly
i
will
to
my
dear
mother
endeavour
to
play
the
hypocrite
do
so
said
henry
the
motive
will
sanction
any
such
deceit
as
that
george
be
assured
the
day
wore
on
and
poor
flora
remained
in
a
very
precarious
situation
it
was
not
until
mid-day
that
henry
made
up
his
mind
he
would
call
in
a
medical
gentleman
to
her
and
then
he
rode
to
the
neighbouring
market-town
where
he
knew
an
extremely
intelligent
practitioner
resided
this
gentleman
henry
resolved
upon
under
a
promise
of
secrecy
makings
confidant
of
but
long
before
he
reached
him
he
found
he
might
well
dispense
with
the
promise
of
secrecy
he
had
never
thought
so
engaged
had
he
been
with
other
matters
that
the
servants
were
cognizant
of
the
whole
affair
and
that
from
them
he
had
no
expectation
of
being
able
to
keep
the
whole
story
in
all
its
details
of
course
such
an
opportunity
for
tale-bearing
and
gossiping
was
not
likely
to
be
lost
and
while
henry
was
thinking
over
how
he
had
better
act
in
the
matter
the
news
that
flora
bannerworth
had
been
visited
in
the
night
by
a
vampyre--for
the
servants
named
the
visitation
such
at
once--was
spreading
all
over
the
county
as
he
rode
along
henry
met
a
gentleman
on
horseback
who
belonged
to
the
county
and
who
reining
in
his
steed
said
to
him
good
morning
mr
bannerworth
good
morning
responded
henry
and
he
would
have
ridden
on
but
the
gentleman
added--
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
sir
but
what
is
the
strange
story
that
is
in
everybody's
mouth
about
a
vampyre
henry
nearly
fell
off
his
horse
he
was
so
much
astonished
and
wheeling
the
animal
around
he
said--
in
everybody's
mouth
yes
i
have
heard
it
from
at
least
a
dozen
persons
you
surprise
me
it
is
untrue
of
course
i
am
not
so
absurd
as
really
to
believe
about
the
vampyre
but
is
there
no
foundation
at
all
for
it
we
generally
find
that
at
the
bottom
of
these
common
reports
there
is
a
something
around
which
as
a
nucleus
the
whole
has
formed
my
sister
is
unwell
ah
and
that's
all
it
really
is
too
bad
now
we
had
a
visitor
last
night
a
thief
i
suppose
yes
yes--i
believe
a
thief
i
do
believe
it
was
a
thief
and
she
was
terrified
of
course
and
upon
such
a
thing
is
grafted
a
story
of
a
vampyre
and
the
marks
of
his
teeth
being
in
her
neck
and
all
the
circumstantial
particulars
yes
yes
good
morning
mr
bannerworth
henry
bade
the
gentleman
good
morning
and
much
vexed
at
the
publicity
which
the
affair
had
already
obtained
he
set
spurs
to
his
horse
determined
that
he
would
speak
to
no
one
else
upon
so
uncomfortable
a
theme
several
attempts
were
made
to
stop
him
but
he
only
waved
his
hand
and
trotted
on
nor
did
he
pause
in
his
speed
till
he
reached
the
door
of
mr
chillingworth
the
medical
man
whom
he
intended
to
consult
henry
knew
that
at
such
a
time
he
would
be
at
home
which
was
the
case
and
he
was
soon
closeted
with
the
man
of
drugs
henry
begged
his
patient
hearing
which
being
accorded
he
related
to
him
at
full
length
what
had
happened
not
omitting
to
the
best
of
his
remembrance
any
one
particular
when
he
had
concluded
his
narration
the
doctor
shifted
his
position
several
times
and
then
said--
that's
all
yes--and
enough
too
more
than
enough
i
should
say
my
young
friend
you
astonish
me
can
you
form
any
supposition
sir
on
the
subject
not
just
now
what
is
your
own
idea
i
cannot
be
said
to
have
one
about
it
it
is
too
absurd
to
tell
you
that
my
brother
george
is
impressed
with
a
belief
a
vampyre
has
visited
the
house
i
never
in
all
my
life
heard
a
more
circumstantial
narrative
in
favour
of
so
hideous
a
superstition
well
but
you
cannot
believe--
believe
what
that
the
dead
can
come
to
life
again
and
by
such
a
process
keep
up
vitality
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
certainly
not
then
why
do
you
ask
me
such
questions
but
the
glaring
facts
of
the
case
i
don't
care
if
they
were
ten
times
more
glaring
i
won't
believe
it
i
would
rather
believe
you
were
all
mad
the
whole
family
of
you--that
at
the
full
of
the
moon
you
all
were
a
little
cracked
and
so
would
i
you
go
home
now
and
i
will
call
and
see
your
sister
in
the
course
of
two
hours
something
may
turn
up
yet
to
throw
some
new
light
upon
this
strange
subject
with
this
understanding
henry
went
home
and
he
took
care
to
ride
as
fast
as
before
in
order
to
avoid
questions
so
that
he
got
back
to
his
old
ancestral
home
without
going
through
the
disagreeable
ordeal
of
having
to
explain
to
any
one
what
had
disturbed
the
peace
of
it
when
henry
reached
his
home
he
found
that
the
evening
was
rapidly
coming
on
and
before
he
could
permit
himself
to
think
upon
any
other
subject
he
inquired
how
his
terrified
sister
had
passed
the
hours
during
his
absence
he
found
that
but
little
improvement
had
taken
place
in
her
and
that
she
had
occasionally
slept
but
to
awaken
and
speak
incoherently
as
if
the
shock
she
had
received
had
had
some
serious
affect
upon
her
nerves
he
repaired
at
once
to
her
room
and
finding
that
she
was
awake
he
leaned
over
her
and
spoke
tenderly
to
her
flora
he
said
dear
flora
you
are
better
now
harry
is
that
you
yes
dear
oh
tell
me
what
has
happened
have
you
not
a
recollection
flora
yes
yes
henry
but
what
was
it
they
none
of
them
will
tell
me
what
it
was
henry
be
calm
dear
no
doubt
some
attempt
to
rob
the
house
think
you
so
yes
the
bay
window
was
peculiarly
adapted
for
such
a
purpose
but
now
that
you
are
removed
here
to
this
room
you
will
be
able
to
rest
in
peace
i
shall
die
of
terror
henry
even
now
those
eyes
are
glaring
on
me
so
hidiously
oh
it
is
fearful--it
is
very
fearful
henry
do
you
not
pity
me
and
no
one
will
promise
to
remain
with
me
at
night
indeed
flora
you
are
mistaken
for
i
intend
to
sit
by
your
bedside
armed
and
so
preserve
you
from
all
harm
she
clutched
his
hand
eagerly
as
she
said--
you
will
henry
you
will
and
not
think
it
too
much
trouble
dear
henry
it
can
be
no
trouble
flora
then
i
shall
rest
in
peace
for
i
know
that
the
dreadful
vampyre
cannot
come
to
me
when
you
are
by-
the
what
flora
the
vampyre
henry
it
was
a
vampyre
good
god
who
told
you
so
no
one
i
have
read
of
them
in
the
book
of
travels
in
norway
which
mr
marchdale
lent
us
all
alas
alas
groaned
henry
discard
i
pray
you
such
a
thought
from
your
mind
can
we
discard
thoughts
what
power
have
we
but
from
that
mind
which
is
ourselves
true
true
hark
what
noise
is
that
i
thought
i
heard
a
noise
henry
when
you
go
ring
for
some
one
first
was
there
not
a
noise
the
accidental
shutting
of
some
door
dear
was
it
that
it
was
then
i
am
relieved
henry
i
sometimes
fancy
i
am
in
the
tomb
and
that
some
one
is
feasting
on
my
flesh
they
do
say
too
that
those
who
in
life
have
been
bled
by
a
vampyre
become
themselves
vampyres
and
have
the
same
horrible
taste
for
blood
as
those
before
them
is
it
not
horrible
you
only
vex
yourself
by
such
thoughts
flora
mr
chillingworth
is
coming
to
see
you
can
he
minister
to
a
mind
diseased
but
yours
is
not
flora
your
mind
is
healthful
and
so
although
his
power
extends
not
so
far
we
will
thank
heaven
dear
flora
that
you
need
it
not
she
sighed
deeply
as
she
said--
heaven
help
me
i
know
not
henry
the
dreadful
being
held
on
by
my
hair
i
must
have
it
all
taken
off
i
tried
to
get
away
but
it
dragged
me
back--a
brutal
thing
it
was
oh
then
at
that
moment
henry
i
felt
as
if
something
strange
took
place
in
my
brain
and
that
i
was
going
mad
i
saw
those
glazed
eyes
close
to
mine--i
felt
a
hot
pestiferous
breath
upon
my
face--help--help
hush
my
flora
hush
look
at
me
i
am
calm
again
it
fixed
its
teeth
in
my
throat
did
i
faint
away
you
did
dear
but
let
me
pray
you
to
refer
all
this
to
imagination
or
at
least
the
greater
part
of
it
but
you
saw
it
yes--
all
saw
it
we
all
saw
some
man--a
housebreaker--it
must
have
been
some
housebreaker
what
more
easy
you
know
dear
flora
than
to
assume
some
such
disguise
was
anything
stolen
not
that
i
know
of
but
there
was
an
alarm
you
know
flora
shook
her
head
as
she
said
in
a
low
voice--
that
which
came
here
was
more
than
mortal
oh
henry
if
it
had
but
killed
me
now
i
had
been
happy
but
i
cannot
live--i
hear
it
breathing
now
talk
of
something
else
dear
flora
said
the
much
distressed
henry
you
will
make
yourself
much
worse
if
you
indulge
yourself
in
these
strange
fancies
oh
that
they
were
but
fancies
they
are
believe
me
there
is
a
strange
confusion
in
my
brain
and
sleep
comes
over
me
suddenly
when
i
least
expect
it
henry
henry
what
i
was
i
shall
never
never
be
again
say
not
so
all
this
will
pass
away
like
a
dream
and
leave
so
faint
a
trace
upon
your
memory
that
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
wonder
it
ever
made
so
deep
an
impression
on
your
mind
you
utter
these
words
henry
she
said
but
they
do
not
come
from
your
heart
ah
no
no
no
who
comes
the
door
was
opened
by
mrs
bannerworth
who
said--
it
is
only
me
my
dear
henry
here
is
dr
chillingworth
in
the
dining-room
henry
turned
to
flora
saying--
you
will
see
him
dear
flora
you
know
mr
chillingworth
well
yes
henry
yes
i
will
see
him
or
whoever
you
please
shew
mr
chillingworth
up
said
henry
to
the
servant
in
a
few
moments
the
medical
man
was
in
the
room
and
he
at
once
approached
the
bedside
to
speak
to
flora
upon
whose
pale
countenance
he
looked
with
evident
interest
while
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
mingled
with
a
painful
feeling--at
least
so
his
own
face
indicated
well
miss
bannerworth
he
said
what
is
all
this
i
hear
about
an
ugly
dream
you
have
had
a
dream
said
flora
as
she
fixed
her
beautiful
eyes
on
his
face
yes
as
i
understand
she
shuddered
and
was
silent
was
it
not
a
dream
then
added
mr
chillingworth
she
wrung
her
hands
and
in
a
voice
of
extreme
anguish
and
pathos
said--
would
it
were
a
dream--would
it
were
a
dream
oh
if
any
one
could
but
convince
me
it
was
a
dream
well
will
you
tell
me
what
it
was
yes
sir
it
was
a
vampyre
mr
chillingworth
glanced
at
henry
as
he
said
in
reply
to
flora's
words--
i
suppose
that
is
after
all
another
name
flora
for
the
nightmare
no--no--no
do
you
really
then
persist
in
believing
anything
so
absurd
miss
bannerworth
what
can
i
say
to
the
evidence
of
my
own
senses
she
replied
i
saw
it
henry
saw
it
george
saw
mr
marchdale
my
mother--all
saw
it
we
could
not
all
be
at
the
same
time
the
victims
of
the
same
delusion
how
faintly
you
speak
i
am
very
faint
and
ill
indeed
what
wound
is
that
on
your
neck
a
wild
expression
came
over
the
face
of
flora
a
spasmodic
action
of
the
muscles
accompanied
with
a
shuddering
as
if
a
sudden
chill
had
come
over
the
whole
mass
of
blood
took
place
and
she
said--
it
is
the
mark
left
by
the
teeth
of
the
vampyre
the
smile
was
a
forced
one
upon
the
face
of
mr
chillingworth
draw
up
the
blind
of
the
window
mr
henry
he
said
and
let
me
examine
this
puncture
to
which
your
sister
attaches
so
extraordinary
a
meaning
illustration
the
blind
was
drawn
up
and
a
strong
light
was
thrown
into
the
room
for
full
two
minutes
mr
chillingworth
attentively
examined
the
two
small
wounds
in
the
neck
of
flora
he
took
a
powerful
magnifying
glass
from
his
pocket
and
looked
at
them
through
it
and
after
his
examination
was
concluded
he
said--
they
are
very
trifling
wounds
indeed
but
how
inflicted
said
henry
by
some
insect
i
should
say
which
probably--it
being
the
season
for
many
insects--has
flown
in
at
the
window
i
know
the
motive
said
flora
which
prompts
all
these
suggestions
it
is
a
kind
one
and
i
ought
to
be
the
last
to
quarrel
with
it
but
what
i
have
seen
nothing
can
make
me
believe
i
saw
not
unless
i
am
as
once
or
twice
i
have
thought
myself
really
mad
how
do
you
now
feel
in
general
health
far
from
well
and
a
strange
drowsiness
at
times
creeps
over
me
even
now
i
feel
it
she
sunk
back
on
the
pillows
as
she
spoke
and
closed
her
eyes
with
a
deep
sigh
mr
chillingworth
beckoned
henry
to
come
with
him
from
the
room
but
the
latter
had
promised
that
he
would
remain
with
flora
and
as
mrs
bannerworth
had
left
the
chamber
because
she
was
unable
to
control
her
feelings
he
rang
the
bell
and
requested
that
his
mother
would
come
she
did
so
and
then
henry
went
down
stairs
along
with
the
medical
man
whose
opinion
he
was
certainly
eager
to
be
now
made
acquainted
with
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
in
an
old-fashioned
room
which
was
called
the
oak
closet
henry
turned
to
mr
chillingworth
and
said--
what
now
is
your
candid
opinion
sir
you
have
seen
my
sister
and
those
strange
indubitable
evidences
of
something
wrong
i
have
and
to
tell
you
candidly
the
truth
mr
henry
i
am
sorely
perplexed
i
thought
you
would
be
it
is
not
often
that
a
medical
man
likes
to
say
so
much
nor
is
it
indeed
often
prudent
that
he
should
do
so
but
in
this
case
i
own
i
am
much
puzzled
it
is
contrary
to
all
my
notions
upon
all
such
subjects
those
wounds
what
do
you
think
of
them
i
know
not
what
to
think
i
am
completely
puzzled
as
regards
them
but
but
do
they
not
really
bear
the
appearance
of
being
bites
they
really
do
and
so
far
then
they
are
actually
in
favour
of
the
dreadful
supposition
which
poor
flora
entertains
so
far
they
certainly
are
i
have
no
doubt
in
the
world
of
their
being
bites
but
we
not
must
jump
to
a
conclusion
that
the
teeth
which
inflicted
them
were
human
it
is
a
strange
case
and
one
which
i
feel
assured
must
give
you
all
much
uneasiness
as
indeed
it
gave
me
but
as
i
said
before
i
will
not
let
my
judgment
give
in
to
the
fearful
and
degrading
superstition
which
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
this
strange
story
would
seem
to
justify
it
is
a
degrading
superstition
to
my
mind
your
sister
seems
to
be
labouring
under
the
effect
of
some
narcotic
indeed
yes
unless
she
really
has
lost
a
quantity
of
blood
which
loss
has
decreased
the
heart's
action
sufficiently
to
produce
the
languor
under
which
she
now
evidently
labours
oh
that
i
could
believe
the
former
supposition
but
i
am
confident
she
has
taken
no
narcotic
she
could
not
even
do
so
by
mistake
for
there
is
no
drug
of
the
sort
in
the
house
besides
she
is
not
heedless
by
any
means
i
am
quite
convinced
she
has
not
done
so
then
i
am
fairly
puzzled
my
young
friend
and
i
can
only
say
that
i
would
freely
have
given
half
of
what
i
am
worth
to
see
that
figure
you
saw
last
night
what
would
you
have
done
i
would
not
have
lost
sight
of
it
for
the
world's
wealth
you
would
have
felt
your
blood
freeze
with
horror
the
face
was
terrible
and
yet
let
it
lead
me
where
it
liked
i
would
have
followed
it
i
wish
you
had
been
here
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
if
i
though
there
was
the
least
chance
of
another
visit
i
would
come
and
wait
with
patience
every
night
for
a
month
i
cannot
say
replied
henry
i
am
going
to
sit
up
to-night
with
my
sister
and
i
believe
our
friend
mr
marchdale
will
share
my
watch
with
me
mr
chillingworth
appeared
to
be
for
a
few
moments
lost
in
thought
and
then
suddenly
rousing
himself
as
if
he
found
it
either
impossible
to
come
to
any
rational
conclusion
upon
the
subject
or
had
arrived
at
one
which
he
chose
to
keep
to
himself
he
said--
well
well
we
must
leave
the
matter
at
present
as
it
stands
time
may
accomplish
something
towards
its
development
but
at
present
so
palpable
a
mystery
i
never
came
across
or
a
matter
in
which
human
calculation
was
so
completely
foiled
nor
i--nor
i
i
will
send
you
some
medicines
such
as
i
think
will
be
of
service
to
flora
and
depend
upon
seeing
me
by
ten
o'clock
to-morrow
morning
you
have
of
course
heard
something
said
henry
to
the
doctor
as
he
was
pulling
on
his
gloves
about
vampyres
i
certainly
have
and
i
understand
that
in
some
countries
particularly
norway
and
sweden
the
superstition
is
a
very
common
one
and
in
the
levant
yes
the
ghouls
of
the
mahometans
are
of
the
same
description
of
beings
all
that
i
have
heard
of
the
european
vampyre
has
made
it
a
being
which
can
be
killed
but
is
restored
to
life
again
by
the
rays
of
a
full
moon
falling
on
the
body
yes
yes
i
have
heard
as
much
and
that
the
hideous
repast
of
blood
has
to
be
taken
very
frequently
and
that
if
the
vampyre
gets
it
not
he
wastes
away
presenting
the
appearance
of
one
in
the
last
stage
of
a
consumption
and
visibly
so
to
speak
dying
that
is
what
i
have
understood
to-night
do
you
know
mr
bannerworth
is
the
full
of
the
moon
henry
started
if
now
you
had
succeeded
in
killing--
pshaw
what
am
i
saying
i
believe
i
am
getting
foolish
and
that
the
horrible
superstition
is
beginning
to
fasten
itself
upon
me
as
well
as
upon
all
of
you
how
strangely
the
fancy
will
wage
war
with
the
judgment
in
such
a
way
as
this
the
full
of
the
moon
repeated
henry
as
he
glanced
towards
the
window
and
the
night
is
near
at
hand
banish
these
thoughts
from
your
mind
said
the
doctor
or
else
my
young
friend
you
will
make
yourself
decidedly
ill
good
evening
to
you
for
it
is
evening
i
shall
see
you
to-morrow
morning
mr
chillingworth
appeared
now
to
be
anxious
to
go
and
henry
no
longer
opposed
his
departure
but
when
he
was
gone
a
sense
of
great
loneliness
came
over
him
to-night
he
repeated
is
the
full
of
the
moon
how
strange
that
this
dreadful
adventure
should
have
taken
place
just
the
night
before
'tis
very
strange
let
me
see--let
me
see
he
took
from
the
shelves
of
a
book
case
the
work
which
flora
had
mentioned
entitled
travels
in
norway
in
which
work
he
found
some
account
of
the
popular
belief
in
vampyres
he
opened
the
work
at
random
and
then
some
of
the
leaves
turned
over
of
themselves
to
a
particular
place
as
the
leaves
of
a
book
will
frequently
do
when
it
has
been
kept
open
a
length
of
time
at
that
part
and
the
binding
stretched
there
more
than
anywhere
else
there
was
a
note
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
pages
at
this
part
of
the
book
and
henry
read
as
follows--
with
regard
to
these
vampyres
it
is
believed
by
those
who
are
inclined
to
give
credence
to
so
dreadful
a
superstition
that
they
always
endeavour
to
make
their
feast
of
blood
for
the
revival
of
their
bodily
powers
on
some
evening
immediately
preceding
a
full
moon
because
if
any
accident
befal
them
such
as
being
shot
or
otherwise
killed
or
wounded
they
can
recover
by
lying
down
somewhere
where
the
full
moon's
rays
will
fall
upon
them
henry
let
the
book
drop
from
his
hands
with
a
groan
and
a
shudder
the
night
watch--the
proposal--the
moonlight--the
fearful
adventure
illustration
a
kind
of
stupefaction
came
over
henry
bannerworth
and
he
sat
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
scarcely
conscious
of
where
he
was
and
almost
incapable
of
anything
in
the
shape
of
rational
thought
it
was
his
brother
george
who
roused
him
by
saying
as
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder--
henry
are
you
asleep
henry
had
not
been
aware
of
his
presence
and
he
started
up
as
if
he
had
been
shot
oh
george
is
it
you
he
said
yes
henry
are
you
unwell
no
no
i
was
in
a
deep
reverie
alas
i
need
not
ask
upon
what
subject
said
george
sadly
i
sought
you
to
bring
you
this
letter
a
letter
to
me
yes
you
see
it
is
addressed
to
you
and
the
seal
looks
as
if
it
came
from
someone
of
consequence
indeed
yes
henry
read
it
and
see
from
whence
it
comes
there
was
just
sufficient
light
by
going
to
the
window
to
enable
henry
to
read
the
letter
which
he
did
aloud
it
ran
thus--
sir
francis
varney
presents
his
compliments
to
mr
beaumont
and
is
much
concerned
to
hear
that
some
domestic
affliction
has
fallen
upon
him
sir
francis
hopes
that
the
genuine
and
loving
sympathy
of
a
neighbour
will
not
be
regarded
as
an
intrusion
and
begs
to
proffer
any
assistance
or
counsel
that
may
be
within
the
compass
of
his
means
ratford
abbey
sir
francis
varney
said
henry
who
is
he
do
you
not
remember
henry
said
george
we
were
told
a
few
days
ago
that
a
gentleman
of
that
name
had
become
the
purchaser
of
the
estate
of
ratford
abbey
oh
yes
yes
have
you
seen
him
i
have
not
i
do
not
wish
to
make
any
new
acquaintance
george
we
are
very
poor--much
poorer
indeed
than
the
general
appearance
of
this
place
which
i
fear
we
shall
soon
have
to
part
with
would
warrant
any
one
believing
i
must
of
course
return
a
civil
answer
to
this
gentleman
but
it
must
be
such
as
one
as
shall
repress
familiarity
that
will
be
difficult
to
do
while
we
remain
here
when
we
come
to
consider
the
very
close
proximity
of
the
two
properties
henry
oh
no
not
at
all
he
will
easily
perceive
that
we
do
not
want
to
make
acquaintance
with
him
and
then
as
a
gentleman
which
doubtless
he
is
he
will
give
up
the
attempt
let
it
be
so
henry
heaven
knows
i
have
no
desire
to
form
any
new
acquaintance
with
any
one
and
more
particularly
under
our
present
circumstances
of
depression
and
now
henry
you
must
permit
me
as
i
have
had
some
repose
to
share
with
you
your
night
watch
in
flora's
room
i
would
advise
you
not
george
your
health
you
know
is
very
far
from
good
nay
allow
me
if
not
then
the
anxiety
i
shall
suffer
will
do
me
more
harm
than
the
watchfulness
i
shall
keep
up
in
her
chamber
this
was
an
argument
which
henry
felt
himself
the
force
of
too
strongly
not
to
admit
it
in
the
case
of
george
and
he
therefore
made
no
further
opposition
to
his
wish
to
make
one
in
the
night
watch
there
will
be
an
advantage
said
george
you
see
in
three
of
us
being
engaged
in
this
matter
because
should
anything
occur
two
can
act
together
and
yet
flora
may
not
be
left
alone
true
true
that
is
a
great
advantage
now
a
soft
gentle
silvery
light
began
to
spread
itself
over
the
heavens
the
moon
was
rising
and
as
the
beneficial
effects
of
the
storm
of
the
preceding
evening
were
still
felt
in
the
clearness
of
the
air
the
rays
appeared
to
be
more
lustrous
and
full
of
beauty
than
they
commonly
were
each
moment
the
night
grew
lighter
and
by
the
time
the
brothers
were
ready
to
take
their
places
in
the
chamber
of
flora
the
moon
had
risen
considerably
although
neither
henry
nor
george
had
any
objection
to
the
company
of
mr
marchdale
yet
they
gave
him
the
option
and
rather
in
fact
urged
him
not
to
destroy
his
night's
repose
by
sitting
up
with
them
but
he
said--
allow
me
to
do
so
i
am
older
and
have
calmer
judgment
than
you
can
have
should
anything
again
appear
i
am
quite
resolved
that
it
shall
not
escape
me
what
would
you
do
with
the
name
of
god
upon
my
lips
said
mr
marchdale
solemnly
i
would
grapple
with
it
you
laid
hands
upon
it
last
night
i
did
and
have
forgotten
to
show
you
what
i
tore
from
it
look
here--what
should
you
say
this
was
he
produced
a
piece
of
cloth
on
which
was
an
old-fashioned
piece
of
lace
and
two
buttons
upon
a
close
inspection
this
appeared
to
be
a
portion
of
the
lapel
of
a
coat
of
ancient
times
and
suddenly
henry
with
a
look
of
intense
anxiety
said--
this
reminds
me
of
the
fashion
of
garments
very
many
years
ago
mr
marchdale
it
came
away
in
my
grasp
as
if
rotten
and
incapable
of
standing
any
rough
usage
what
a
strange
unearthly
smell
it
has
now
you
mention
it
yourself
added
mr
marchdale
i
must
confess
it
smells
to
me
as
if
it
had
really
come
from
the
very
grave
it
does--it
does
say
nothing
of
this
relic
of
last
night's
work
to
any
one
be
assured
i
shall
not
i
am
far
from
wishing
to
keep
up
in
any
one's
mind
proofs
of
that
which
i
would
fain
very
fain
refute
mr
marchdale
replaced
the
portion
of
the
coat
which
the
figure
had
worn
in
his
pocket
and
then
the
whole
three
proceeded
to
the
chamber
of
flora





it
was
within
a
very
few
minutes
of
midnight
the
moon
had
climbed
high
in
the
heavens
and
a
night
of
such
brightness
and
beauty
had
seldom
shown
itself
for
a
long
period
of
time
flora
slept
and
in
her
chamber
sat
the
two
brothers
and
mr
marchdale
silently
for
she
had
shown
symptoms
of
restlessness
and
they
much
feared
to
break
the
light
slumber
into
which
she
had
fallen
occasionally
they
had
conversed
in
whispers
which
could
not
have
the
effect
of
rousing
her
for
the
room
although
smaller
than
the
one
she
had
before
occupied
was
still
sufficiently
spacious
to
enable
them
to
get
some
distance
from
the
bed
until
the
hour
of
midnight
now
actually
struck
they
were
silent
and
when
the
last
echo
of
the
sounds
had
died
away
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
came
over
them
which
prompted
some
conversation
to
get
rid
of
it
how
bright
the
moon
is
now
said
henry
in
a
low
tone
i
never
saw
it
brighter
replied
marchdale
i
feel
as
if
i
were
assured
that
we
shall
not
to-night
be
interrupted
it
was
later
than
this
said
henry
it
was--it
was
do
not
then
yet
congratulate
us
upon
no
visit
how
still
the
house
is
remarked
george
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
had
never
found
it
so
intensely
quiet
before
it
is
very
still
hush
she
moves
flora
moaned
in
her
sleep
and
made
a
slight
movement
the
curtains
were
all
drawn
closely
round
the
bed
to
shield
her
eyes
from
the
bright
moonlight
which
streamed
into
the
room
so
brilliantly
they
might
have
closed
the
shutters
of
the
window
but
this
they
did
not
like
to
do
as
it
would
render
their
watch
there
of
no
avail
at
all
inasmuch
as
they
would
not
be
able
to
see
if
any
attempt
was
made
by
any
one
to
obtain
admittance
a
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
might
have
thus
passed
when
mr
marchdale
said
in
a
whisper--
a
thought
has
just
struck
me
that
the
piece
of
coat
i
have
which
i
dragged
from
the
figure
last
night
wonderfully
resembles
in
colour
and
appearance
the
style
of
dress
of
the
portrait
in
the
room
which
flora
lately
slept
in
i
thought
of
that
said
henry
when
first
i
saw
it
but
to
tell
the
honest
truth
i
dreaded
to
suggest
any
new
proof
connected
with
last
night's
visitation
then
i
ought
not
to
have
drawn
your
attention
to
it
said
mr
marchdale
and
regret
i
have
done
so
nay
do
not
blame
yourself
on
such
an
account
said
henry
you
are
quite
right
and
it
is
i
who
am
too
foolishly
sensitive
now
however
since
you
have
mentioned
it
i
must
own
i
have
a
great
desire
to
test
the
accuracy
of
the
observation
by
a
comparison
with
the
portrait
that
may
easily
be
done
i
will
remain
here
said
george
in
case
flora
awakens
while
you
two
go
if
you
like
it
is
but
across
the
corridor
henry
immediately
rose
saying--
come
mr
marchdale
come
let
us
satisfy
ourselves
at
all
events
upon
this
point
at
once
as
george
says
it
is
only
across
the
corridor
and
we
can
return
directly
i
am
willing
said
mr
marchdale
with
a
tone
of
sadness
there
was
no
light
needed
for
the
moon
stood
suspended
in
a
cloudless
sky
so
that
from
the
house
being
a
detached
one
and
containing
numerous
windows
it
was
as
light
as
day
although
the
distance
from
one
chamber
to
the
other
was
only
across
the
corridor
it
was
a
greater
space
than
these
words
might
occupy
for
the
corridor
was
wide
neither
was
it
directly
across
but
considerably
slanting
however
it
was
certainly
sufficiently
close
at
hand
for
any
sound
of
alarm
from
one
chamber
to
reach
another
without
any
difficulty
a
few
moments
sufficed
to
place
henry
and
mr
marchdale
in
that
antique
room
where
from
the
effect
of
the
moonlight
which
was
streaming
over
it
the
portrait
on
the
panel
looked
exceedingly
life
like
and
this
effect
was
probably
the
greater
because
the
rest
of
the
room
was
not
illuminated
by
the
moon's
rays
which
came
through
a
window
in
the
corridor
and
then
at
the
open
door
of
that
chamber
upon
the
portrait
mr
marchdale
held
the
piece
of
cloth
he
had
close
to
the
dress
of
the
portrait
and
one
glance
was
sufficient
to
show
the
wonderful
likeness
between
the
two
good
god
said
henry
it
is
the
same
mr
marchdale
dropped
the
piece
of
cloth
and
trembled
this
fact
shakes
even
your
scepticism
said
henry
i
know
not
what
to
make
of
it
i
can
tell
you
something
which
bears
upon
it
i
do
not
know
if
you
are
sufficiently
aware
of
my
family
history
to
know
that
this
one
of
my
ancestors
i
wish
i
could
say
worthy
ancestors
committed
suicide
and
was
buried
in
his
clothes
you--you
are
sure
of
that
quite
sure
i
am
more
and
more
bewildered
as
each
moment
some
strange
corroborative
fact
of
that
dreadful
supposition
we
so
much
shrink
from
seems
to
come
to
light
and
to
force
itself
upon
our
attention
there
was
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
duration
and
henry
had
turned
towards
mr
marchdale
to
say
something
when
the
cautious
tread
of
a
footstep
was
heard
in
the
garden
immediately
beneath
that
balcony
a
sickening
sensation
came
over
henry
and
he
was
compelled
to
lean
against
the
wall
for
support
as
in
scarcely
articulate
accents
he
said--
the
vampyre--the
vampyre
god
of
heaven
it
has
come
once
again
now
heaven
inspire
us
with
more
than
mortal
courage
cried
mr
marchdale
and
he
dashed
open
the
window
at
once
and
sprang
into
the
balcony
henry
in
a
moment
recovered
himself
sufficiently
to
follow
him
and
when
he
reached
his
side
in
the
balcony
marchdale
said
as
he
pointed
below--
there
is
some
one
concealed
there
where--where
among
the
laurels
i
will
fire
a
random
shot
and
we
may
do
some
execution
hold
said
a
voice
from
below
don't
do
any
such
thing
i
beg
of
you
why
that
is
mr
chillingworth's
voice
cried
henry
yes
and
it's
mr
chillingworth's
person
too
said
the
doctor
as
he
emerged
from
among
some
laurel
bushes
how
is
this
said
marchdale
simply
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
keep
watch
and
ward
to-night
outside
here
in
the
hope
of
catching
the
vampyre
i
got
into
here
by
climbing
the
gate
but
why
did
you
not
let
me
know
said
henry
because
i
did
not
know
myself
my
young
friend
till
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
have
you
seen
anything
nothing
but
i
fancied
i
heard
something
in
the
park
outside
the
wall
indeed
what
say
you
henry
said
mr
marchdale
to
descending
and
taking
a
hasty
examination
of
the
garden
and
grounds
i
am
willing
but
first
allow
me
to
speak
to
george
who
otherwise
might
be
surprised
at
our
long
absence
henry
walked
rapidly
to
the
bed
chamber
of
flora
and
he
said
to
george--
have
you
any
objection
to
being
left
alone
here
for
about
half
an
hour
george
while
we
make
an
examination
of
the
garden
let
me
have
some
weapon
and
i
care
not
remain
here
while
i
fetch
a
sword
from
my
own
room
henry
did
so
and
when
george
returned
with
a
sword
which
he
always
kept
in
his
bed-room
he
said--
now
go
henry
i
prefer
a
weapon
of
this
description
to
pistols
much
do
not
be
longer
gone
than
necessary
i
will
not
george
be
assured
george
was
then
left
alone
and
henry
returned
to
the
balcony
where
mr
marchdale
was
waiting
for
him
it
was
a
quicker
mode
of
descending
to
the
garden
to
do
so
by
clambering
over
the
balcony
than
any
other
and
the
height
was
not
considerable
enough
to
make
it
very
objectionable
so
henry
and
mr
marchdale
chose
that
way
of
joining
mr
chillingworth
you
are
no
doubt
much
surprised
at
finding
me
here
said
the
doctor
but
the
fact
is
i
half
made
up
my
mind
to
come
while
i
was
here
but
i
had
not
thoroughly
done
so
therefore
i
said
nothing
to
you
about
it
we
are
much
indebted
to
you
said
henry
for
making
the
attempt
i
am
prompted
to
it
by
a
feeling
of
the
strongest
curiosity
are
you
armed
sir
said
marchdale
in
this
stick
said
the
doctor
is
a
sword
the
exquisite
temper
of
which
i
know
i
can
depend
upon
and
i
fully
intended
to
run
through
any
one
whom
i
saw
that
looked
in
the
least
of
the
vampyre
order
you
would
have
done
quite
right
replied
mr
marchdale
i
have
a
brace
of
pistols
here
loaded
with
ball
will
you
take
one
henry
if
you
please
and
then
we
shall
be
all
armed
thus
then
prepared
for
any
exigency
they
made
the
whole
round
of
the
house
but
found
all
the
fastenings
secure
and
everything
as
quiet
as
possible
suppose
now
we
take
a
survey
of
the
park
outside
the
garden
wall
said
mr
marchdale
this
was
agreed
to
but
before
they
had
proceeded
far
mr
marchdale
said--
there
is
a
ladder
lying
on
the
wall
would
it
not
be
a
good
plan
to
place
it
against
the
very
spot
the
supposed
vampyre
jumped
over
last
night
and
so
from
a
more
elevated
position
take
a
view
of
the
open
meadows
we
could
easily
drop
down
on
the
outer
side
if
we
saw
anything
suspicious
not
a
bad
plan
said
the
doctor
shall
we
do
it
certainly
said
henry
and
they
accordingly
carried
the
ladder
which
had
been
used
for
pruning
the
trees
towards
the
spot
at
the
end
of
the
long
walk
at
which
the
vampyre
had
made
good
after
so
many
fruitless
efforts
his
escape
from
the
premises
they
made
haste
down
the
long
vista
of
trees
until
they
reached
the
exact
spot
and
then
they
placed
the
ladder
as
near
as
possible
exactly
where
henry
in
his
bewilderment
on
the
evening
before
had
seen
the
apparition
from
the
grave
spring
to
we
can
ascend
singly
said
marchdale
but
there
is
ample
space
for
us
all
there
to
sit
on
the
top
of
the
wall
and
make
our
observations
this
was
seen
to
be
the
case
and
in
about
a
couple
of
minutes
they
had
taken
up
their
positions
on
the
wall
and
although
the
height
was
but
trifling
they
found
that
they
had
a
much
more
extensive
view
than
they
could
have
obtained
by
any
other
means
to
contemplate
the
beauty
of
such
a
night
as
this
said
mr
chillingworth
is
amply
sufficient
compensation
for
coming
the
distance
i
have
and
who
knows
remarked
marchdale
we
may
yet
see
something
which
may
throw
a
light
upon
our
present
perplexities
god
knows
that
i
would
give
all
i
can
call
mine
in
the
world
to
relieve
you
and
your
sister
henry
bannerworth
from
the
fearful
effect
which
last
night's
proceedings
cannot
fail
to
have
upon
you
of
that
i
am
well
assured
mr
marchdale
said
henry
if
the
happiness
of
myself
and
family
depended
upon
you
we
should
be
happy
indeed
you
are
silent
mr
chillingworth
remarked
marchdale
after
a
slight
pause
hush
said
mr
chillingworth--hush--hush
good
god
what
do
you
hear
cried
henry
the
doctor
laid
his
hand
upon
henry's
arm
as
he
said--
there
is
a
young
lime
tree
yonder
to
the
right
yes--yes
carry
your
eye
from
it
in
a
horizontal
line
as
near
as
you
can
towards
the
wood
henry
did
so
and
then
he
uttered
a
sudden
exclamation
of
surprise
and
pointed
to
a
rising
spot
of
ground
which
was
yet
in
consequence
of
the
number
of
tall
trees
in
its
vicinity
partially
enveloped
in
shadow
what
is
that
he
said
i
see
something
said
marchdale
by
heaven
it
is
a
human
form
lying
stretched
there
it
is--as
if
in
death
what
can
it
be
said
chillingworth
i
dread
to
say
replied
marchdale
but
to
my
eyes
even
at
this
distance
it
seems
like
the
form
of
him
we
chased
last
night
the
vampyre
yes--yes
look
the
moonbeams
touch
him
now
the
shadows
of
the
trees
gradually
recede
god
of
heaven
the
figure
moves
henry's
eyes
were
riveted
to
that
fearful
object
and
now
a
scene
presented
itself
which
filled
them
all
with
wonder
and
astonishment
mingled
with
sensations
of
the
greatest
awe
and
alarm
as
the
moonbeams
in
consequence
of
the
luminary
rising
higher
and
higher
in
the
heavens
came
to
touch
this
figure
that
lay
extended
on
the
rising
ground
a
perceptible
movement
took
place
in
it
the
limbs
appeared
to
tremble
and
although
it
did
not
rise
up
the
whole
body
gave
signs
of
vitality
the
vampyre--the
vampyre
said
mr
marchdale
i
cannot
doubt
it
now
we
must
have
hit
him
last
night
with
the
pistol
bullets
and
the
moonbeams
are
now
restoring
him
to
a
new
life
henry
shuddered
and
even
mr
chillingworth
turned
pale
but
he
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
sufficiently
to
propose
some
course
of
action
and
he
said--
let
us
descend
and
go
up
to
this
figure
it
is
a
duty
we
owe
to
ourselves
as
much
as
to
society
hold
a
moment
said
mr
marchdale
as
he
produced
a
pistol
i
am
an
unerring
shot
as
you
well
know
henry
before
we
move
from
this
position
we
now
occupy
allow
me
to
try
what
virtue
may
be
in
a
bullet
to
lay
that
figure
low
again
he
is
rising
exclaimed
henry
mr
marchdale
levelled
the
pistol--he
took
a
sure
and
deliberate
aim
and
then
just
as
the
figure
seemed
to
be
struggling
to
its
feet
he
fired
and
with
a
sudden
bound
it
fell
again
you
have
hit
it
said
henry
you
have
indeed
exclaimed
the
doctor
i
think
we
can
go
now
hush
said
marchdale--hush
does
it
not
seem
to
you
that
hit
it
as
often
as
you
will
the
moonbeams
will
recover
it
yes--yes
said
henry
they
will--they
will
i
can
endure
this
no
longer
said
mr
chillingworth
as
he
sprung
from
the
wall
follow
me
or
not
as
you
please
i
will
seek
the
spot
where
this
being
lies
oh
be
not
rash
cried
marchdale
see
it
rises
again
and
its
form
looks
gigantic
i
trust
in
heaven
and
a
righteous
cause
said
the
doctor
as
he
drew
the
sword
he
had
spoken
of
from
the
stick
and
threw
away
the
scabbard
come
with
me
if
you
like
or
i
go
alone
henry
at
once
jumped
down
from
the
wall
and
then
marchdale
followed
him
saying--
come
on
i
will
not
shrink
they
ran
towards
the
piece
of
rising
ground
but
before
they
got
to
it
the
form
rose
and
made
rapidly
towards
a
little
wood
which
was
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
hillock
it
is
conscious
of
being
pursued
cried
the
doctor
see
how
it
glances
back
and
then
increases
its
speed
fire
upon
it
henry
said
marchdale
he
did
so
but
either
his
shot
did
not
take
effect
or
it
was
quite
unheeded
if
it
did
by
the
vampyre
which
gained
the
wood
before
they
could
have
a
hope
of
getting
sufficiently
near
it
to
effect
or
endeavour
to
effect
a
capture
i
cannot
follow
it
there
said
marchdale
in
open
country
i
would
have
pursued
it
closely
but
i
cannot
follow
it
into
the
intricacies
of
a
wood
pursuit
is
useless
there
said
henry
it
is
enveloped
in
the
deepest
gloom
i
am
not
so
unreasonable
remarked
mr
chillingworth
as
to
wish
you
to
follow
into
such
a
place
as
that
i
am
confounded
utterly
by
this
affair
and
i
said
marchdale
what
on
earth
is
to
be
done
nothing--nothing
exclaimed
henry
vehemently
and
yet
i
have
beneath
the
canopy
of
heaven
declared
that
i
will
so
help
me
god
spare
neither
time
nor
trouble
in
the
unravelling
of
this
most
fearful
piece
of
business
did
either
of
you
remark
the
clothing
which
this
spectral
appearance
wore
they
were
antique
clothes
said
mr
chillingworth
such
as
might
have
been
fashionable
a
hundred
years
ago
but
not
now
such
was
my
impression
added
marchdale
and
such
my
own
said
henry
excitedly
is
it
at
all
within
the
compass
of
the
wildest
belief
that
what
we
have
seen
is
a
vampyre
and
no
other
than
my
ancestor
who
a
hundred
years
ago
committed
suicide
there
was
so
much
intense
excitement
and
evidence
of
mental
suffering
that
mr
chillingworth
took
him
by
the
arm
saying--
come
home--come
home
no
more
of
this
at
present
you
will
but
make
yourself
seriously
unwell
no--no--no
come
home
now
i
pray
you
you
are
by
far
too
much
excited
about
this
matter
to
pursue
it
with
the
calmness
which
should
be
brought
to
bear
upon
it
take
advice
henry
said
marchdale
take
advice
and
come
home
at
once
i
will
yield
to
you
i
feel
that
i
cannot
control
my
own
feelings--i
will
yield
to
you
who
as
you
say
are
cooler
on
this
subject
than
i
can
be
oh
flora
flora
i
have
no
comfort
to
bring
to
you
now
poor
henry
bannerworth
appeared
to
be
in
a
complete
state
of
mental
prostration
on
account
of
the
distressing
circumstances
that
had
occurred
so
rapidly
and
so
suddenly
in
his
family
which
had
had
quite
enough
to
contend
with
without
having
superadded
to
every
other
evil
the
horror
of
believing
that
some
preternatural
agency
was
at
work
to
destroy
every
hope
of
future
happiness
in
this
world
under
any
circumstances
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
home
by
mr
chillingworth
and
marchdale
he
no
longer
attempted
to
dispute
the
dreadful
fact
concerning
the
supposed
vampyre
he
could
not
contend
now
against
all
the
corroborating
circumstances
that
seemed
to
collect
together
for
the
purpose
of
proving
that
which
even
when
proved
was
contrary
to
all
his
notions
of
heaven
and
at
variance
with
all
that
was
recorded
and
established
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
system
of
nature
i
cannot
deny
he
said
when
they
had
reached
home
that
such
things
are
possible
but
the
probability
will
not
bear
a
moment's
investigation
there
are
more
things
said
marchdale
solemnly
in
heaven
and
on
earth
than
are
dreamed
of
in
our
philosophy
there
are
indeed
it
appears
said
mr
chillingworth
and
are
you
a
convert
said
henry
turning
to
him
a
convert
to
what
to
a
belief
in--in--these
vampyres
i
no
indeed
if
you
were
to
shut
me
up
in
a
room
full
of
vampyres
i
would
tell
them
all
to
their
teeth
that
i
defied
them
but
after
what
we
have
seen
to-night
what
have
we
seen
you
are
yourself
a
witness
true
i
saw
a
man
lying
down
and
then
i
saw
a
man
get
up
he
seemed
then
to
be
shot
but
whether
he
was
or
not
he
only
knows
and
then
i
saw
him
walk
off
in
a
desperate
hurry
beyond
that
i
saw
nothing
yes
but
taking
such
circumstances
into
combination
with
others
have
you
not
a
terrible
fear
of
the
truth
of
the
dreadful
appearance
no--no
on
my
soul
no
i
will
die
in
my
disbelief
of
such
an
outrage
upon
heaven
as
one
of
these
creatures
would
most
assuredly
be
oh
that
i
could
think
like
you
but
the
circumstance
strikes
too
nearly
to
my
heart
be
of
better
cheer
henry--be
of
better
cheer
said
marchdale
there
is
one
circumstance
which
we
ought
to
consider
it
is
that
from
all
we
have
seen
there
seems
to
be
some
things
which
would
favour
an
opinion
henry
that
your
ancestor
whose
portrait
hangs
in
the
chamber
which
was
occupied
by
flora
is
the
vampyre
the
dress
was
the
same
said
henry
i
noted
it
was
and
i
do
you
not
then
think
it
possible
that
something
might
be
done
to
set
that
part
of
the
question
at
rest
what--what
where
is
your
ancestor
buried
ah
i
understand
you
now
and
i
said
mr
chillingworth
you
would
propose
a
visit
to
his
mansion
i
would
added
marchdale
anything
that
may
in
any
way
tend
to
assist
in
making
this
affair
clearer
and
divesting
it
of
its
mysterious
circumstances
will
be
most
desirable
henry
appeared
to
rouse
for
some
moments
and
then
he
said--
he
in
common
with
many
other
members
of
the
family
no
doubt
occupies
place
in
the
vault
under
the
old
church
in
the
village
would
it
be
possible
asked
marchdale
to
get
into
that
vault
without
exciting
general
attention
it
would
said
henry
the
entrance
to
the
vault
is
in
the
flooring
of
the
pew
which
belongs
to
the
family
in
the
old
church
then
it
could
be
done
asked
mr
chillingworth
most
undoubtedly
will
you
under
take
such
an
adventure
said
mr
chillingworth
it
may
ease
your
mind
he
was
buried
in
the
vault
and
in
his
clothes
said
henry
musingly
i
will
think
of
it
about
such
a
proposition
i
would
not
decide
hastily
give
me
leave
to
think
of
it
until
to-morrow
most
certainly
illustration
they
now
made
their
way
to
the
chamber
of
flora
and
they
heard
from
george
that
nothing
of
an
alarming
character
had
occurred
to
disturb
him
on
his
lonely
watch
the
morning
was
now
again
dawning
and
henry
earnestly
entreated
mr
marchdale
to
go
to
bed
which
he
did
leaving
the
two
brothers
to
continue
as
sentinels
by
flora's
bed
side
until
the
morning
light
should
banish
all
uneasy
thoughts
henry
related
to
george
what
had
taken
place
outside
the
house
and
the
two
brothers
held
a
long
and
interesting
conversation
for
some
hours
upon
that
subject
as
well
as
upon
others
of
great
importance
to
their
welfare
it
was
not
until
the
sun's
early
rays
came
glaring
in
at
the
casement
that
they
both
rose
and
thought
of
awakening
flora
who
had
now
slept
soundly
for
so
many
hours
a
glance
at
the
bannerworth
family--the
probable
consequences
of
the
mysterious
apparition's
appearance
illustration
having
thus
far
we
hope
interested
our
readers
in
the
fortunes
of
a
family
which
had
become
subject
to
so
dreadful
a
visitation
we
trust
that
a
few
words
concerning
them
and
the
peculiar
circumstances
in
which
they
are
now
placed
will
not
prove
altogether
out
of
place
or
unacceptable
the
bannerworth
family
then
were
well
known
in
the
part
of
the
country
where
they
resided
perhaps
if
we
were
to
say
they
were
better
known
by
name
than
they
were
liked
on
account
of
that
name
we
should
be
near
the
truth
for
it
had
unfortunately
happened
that
for
a
very
considerable
time
past
the
head
of
the
family
had
been
the
very
worst
specimen
of
it
that
could
be
procured
while
the
junior
branches
were
frequently
amiable
and
most
intelligent
and
such
in
mind
and
manner
as
were
calculated
to
inspire
goodwill
in
all
who
knew
them
he
who
held
the
family
property
and
who
resided
in
the
house
now
occupied
by
flora
and
her
brothers
was
a
very
so--so
sort
of
character
this
state
of
things
by
some
strange
fatality
had
gone
on
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
and
the
consequence
was
what
might
have
been
fairly
expected
namely--that
what
with
their
vices
and
what
with
their
extravagances
the
successive
heads
of
the
bannerworth
family
had
succeeded
in
so
far
diminishing
the
family
property
that
when
it
came
into
the
hands
of
henry
bannerworth
it
was
of
little
value
on
account
of
the
numerous
encumbrances
with
which
it
was
saddled
the
father
of
henry
had
not
been
a
very
brilliant
exception
to
the
general
rule
as
regarded
the
head
of
the
family
if
he
were
not
quite
so
bad
as
many
of
his
ancestors
that
gratifying
circumstance
was
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
supposition
that
he
was
not
quite
so
bold
and
that
the
change
in
habits
manners
and
laws
which
had
taken
place
in
a
hundred
years
made
it
not
so
easy
for
even
a
landed
proprietor
to
play
the
petty
tyrant
he
had
to
get
rid
of
those
animal
spirits
which
had
prompted
many
of
his
predecessors
to
downright
crimes
had
recourse
to
the
gaming-table
and
after
raising
whatever
sums
he
could
upon
the
property
which
remained
he
naturally
and
as
might
have
been
fully
expected
lost
them
all
he
was
found
lying
dead
in
the
garden
of
the
house
one
day
and
by
his
side
was
his
pocket-book
on
one
leaf
of
which
it
was
the
impression
of
the
family
he
had
endeavoured
to
write
something
previous
to
his
decease
for
he
held
a
pencil
firmly
in
his
grasp
the
probability
was
that
he
had
felt
himself
getting
ill
and
being
desirous
of
making
some
communication
to
his
family
which
pressed
heavily
upon
his
mind
he
had
attempted
to
do
so
but
was
stopped
by
the
too
rapid
approach
of
the
hand
of
death
for
some
days
previous
to
his
decease
his
conduct
had
been
extremely
mysterious
he
had
announced
an
intention
of
leaving
england
for
ever--of
selling
the
house
and
grounds
for
whatever
they
would
fetch
over
and
above
the
sums
for
which
they
were
mortgaged
and
so
clearing
himself
of
all
encumbrances
he
had
but
a
few
hours
before
he
was
found
lying
dead
made
the
following
singular
speech
to
henry--
do
not
regret
henry
that
the
old
house
which
has
been
in
our
family
so
long
is
about
to
be
parted
with
be
assured
that
if
it
is
but
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
have
good
and
substantial
reasons
now
for
what
i
am
about
to
do
we
shall
be
able
to
go
some
other
country
and
there
live
like
princes
of
the
land
where
the
means
were
to
come
from
to
live
like
a
prince
unless
mr
bannerworth
had
some
of
the
german
princes
in
his
eye
no
one
knew
but
himself
and
his
sudden
death
buried
with
him
that
most
important
secret
there
were
some
words
written
on
the
leaf
of
his
pocket-book
but
they
were
of
by
far
too
indistinct
and
ambiguous
a
nature
to
lead
to
anything
they
were
these--
the
money
is
----------
and
then
there
was
a
long
scrawl
of
the
pencil
which
seemed
to
have
been
occasioned
by
his
sudden
decease
of
course
nothing
could
be
made
of
these
words
except
in
the
way
of
a
contradiction
as
the
family
lawyer
said
rather
more
facetiously
than
a
man
of
law
usually
speaks
for
if
he
had
written
the
money
is
not
he
would
have
been
somewhere
remarkably
near
the
truth
however
with
all
his
vices
he
was
regretted
by
his
children
who
chose
rather
to
remember
him
in
his
best
aspect
than
to
dwell
upon
his
faults
for
the
first
time
then
within
the
memory
of
man
the
head
of
the
family
of
the
bannerworths
was
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
brave
generous
highly
educated
and
full
of
many
excellent
and
noble
qualities--for
such
was
henry
whom
we
have
introduced
to
our
readers
under
such
distressing
circumstances
and
now
people
said
that
the
family
property
having
been
all
dissipated
and
lost
there
would
take
place
a
change
and
that
the
bannerworths
would
have
to
take
to
some
course
of
honourable
industry
for
a
livelihood
and
that
then
they
would
be
as
much
respected
as
they
had
before
been
detested
and
disliked
indeed
the
position
which
henry
held
was
now
a
most
precarious
one--for
one
of
the
amazingly
clever
acts
of
his
father
had
been
to
encumber
the
property
with
overwhelming
claims
so
that
when
henry
administered
to
the
estate
it
was
doubted
almost
by
his
attorney
if
it
were
at
all
desirable
to
do
so
an
attachment
however
to
the
old
house
of
his
family
had
induced
the
young
man
to
hold
possession
of
it
as
long
as
he
could
despite
any
adverse
circumstance
which
might
eventually
be
connected
with
it
some
weeks
however
only
after
the
decease
of
his
father
and
when
he
fairly
held
possession
a
sudden
and
a
most
unexpected
offer
came
to
him
from
a
solicitor
in
london
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
to
purchase
the
house
and
grounds
for
a
client
of
his
who
had
instructed
him
so
to
do
but
whom
he
did
not
mention
the
offer
made
was
a
liberal
one
and
beyond
the
value
of
the
place
the
lawyer
who
had
conducted
henry's
affairs
for
him
since
his
father's
decease
advised
him
by
all
means
to
take
it
but
after
a
consultation
with
his
mother
and
sister
and
george
they
all
resolved
to
hold
by
their
own
house
as
long
as
they
could
and
consequently
he
refused
the
offer
he
was
then
asked
to
let
the
place
and
to
name
his
own
price
for
the
occupation
of
it
but
that
he
would
not
do
so
the
negotiation
went
off
altogether
leaving
only
in
the
minds
of
the
family
much
surprise
at
the
exceeding
eagerness
of
some
one
whom
they
knew
not
to
get
possession
of
the
place
on
any
terms
there
was
another
circumstance
perhaps
which
materially
aided
in
producing
a
strong
feeling
on
the
minds
of
the
bannerworths
with
regard
to
remaining
where
they
were
that
circumstance
occurred
thus
a
relation
of
the
family
who
was
now
dead
and
with
whom
had
died
all
his
means
had
been
in
the
habit
for
the
last
half
dozen
years
of
his
life
of
sending
a
hundred
pounds
to
henry
for
the
express
purpose
of
enabling
him
and
his
brother
george
and
his
sifter
flora
to
take
a
little
continental
or
home
tour
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
a
more
acceptable
present
or
for
a
more
delightful
purpose
to
young
people
could
not
be
found
and
with
the
quiet
prudent
habits
of
all
three
of
them
they
contrived
to
go
far
and
to
see
much
for
the
sum
which
was
thus
handsomely
placed
at
their
disposal
in
one
of
those
excursions
when
among
the
mountains
of
italy
an
adventure
occurred
which
placed
the
life
of
flora
in
imminent
hazard
they
were
riding
along
a
narrow
mountain
path
and
her
horse
slipping
she
fell
over
the
ledge
of
a
precipice
in
an
instant
a
young
man
a
stranger
to
the
whole
party
who
was
travelling
in
the
vicinity
rushed
to
the
spot
and
by
his
knowledge
and
exertions
they
felt
convinced
her
preservation
was
effected
he
told
her
to
lie
quiet
he
encouraged
her
to
hope
for
immediate
succour
and
then
with
much
personal
exertion
and
at
immense
risk
to
himself
he
reached
the
ledge
of
rock
on
which
she
lay
and
then
he
supported
her
until
the
brothers
had
gone
to
a
neighbouring
house
which
bye-the-bye
was
two
good
english
miles
off
and
got
assistance
there
came
on
while
they
were
gone
a
terrific
storm
and
flora
felt
that
but
for
him
who
was
with
her
she
must
have
been
hurled
from
the
rock
and
perished
in
an
abyss
below
which
was
almost
too
deep
for
observation
suffice
it
to
say
that
she
was
rescued
and
he
who
had
by
his
intrepidity
done
so
much
towards
saving
her
was
loaded
with
the
most
sincere
and
heartfelt
acknowledgments
by
the
brothers
as
well
as
by
herself
he
frankly
told
them
that
his
name
was
holland
that
he
was
travelling
for
amusement
and
instruction
and
was
by
profession
an
artist
he
travelled
with
them
for
some
time
and
it
was
not
at
all
to
be
wondered
at
under
the
circumstances
that
an
attachment
of
the
tenderest
nature
should
spring
up
between
him
and
the
beautiful
girl
who
felt
that
she
owed
to
him
her
life
mutual
glances
of
affection
were
exchanged
between
them
and
it
was
arranged
that
when
he
returned
to
england
he
should
come
at
once
as
an
honoured
guest
to
the
house
of
the
family
of
the
bannerworths
all
this
was
settled
satisfactorily
with
the
full
knowledge
and
acquiescence
of
the
two
brothers
who
had
taken
a
strange
attachment
to
the
young
charles
holland
who
was
indeed
in
every
way
likely
to
propitiate
the
good
opinion
of
all
who
knew
him
henry
explained
to
him
exactly
how
they
were
situated
and
told
him
that
when
he
came
he
would
find
a
welcome
from
all
except
possibly
his
father
whose
wayward
temper
he
could
not
answer
for
young
holland
stated
that
he
was
compelled
to
be
away
for
a
term
of
two
years
from
certain
family
arrangements
he
had
entered
into
and
that
then
he
would
return
and
hope
to
meet
flora
unchanged
as
he
should
be
it
happened
that
this
was
the
last
of
the
continental
excursions
of
the
bannerworths
for
before
another
year
rolled
round
the
generous
relative
who
had
supplied
them
with
the
means
of
making
such
delightful
trips
was
no
more
and
likewise
the
death
of
the
father
had
occurred
in
the
manner
we
have
related
so
that
there
was
no
chance
as
had
been
anticipated
and
hoped
for
by
flora
of
meeting
charles
holland
on
the
continent
again
before
his
two
years
of
absence
from
england
should
be
expired
such
however
being
the
state
of
things
flora
felt
reluctant
to
give
up
the
house
where
he
would
be
sure
to
come
to
look
for
her
and
her
happiness
was
too
dear
to
henry
to
induce
him
to
make
any
sacrifice
of
it
to
expediency
therefore
was
it
that
bannerworth
hall
as
it
was
sometimes
called
was
retained
and
fully
intended
to
be
retained
at
all
events
until
after
charles
holland
had
made
his
appearance
and
his
advice
for
he
was
by
the
young
people
considered
as
one
of
the
family
taken
with
regard
to
what
was
advisable
to
be
done
with
one
exception
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
at
the
hall
and
that
exception
relates
to
mr
marchdale
he
was
a
distant
relation
of
mrs
bannerworth
and
in
early
life
had
been
sincerely
and
tenderly
attached
to
her
she
however
with
the
want
of
steady
reflection
of
a
young
girl
as
she
then
was
had
as
is
generally
the
case
among
several
admirers
chosen
the
very
worst
that
is
the
man
who
treated
her
with
the
most
indifference
and
who
paid
her
the
least
attention
was
of
course
thought
the
most
of
and
she
gave
her
hand
to
him
that
man
was
mr
bannerworth
but
future
experience
had
made
her
thoroughly
awake
to
her
former
error
and
but
for
the
love
she
bore
her
children
who
were
certainly
all
that
a
mother's
heart
could
wish
she
would
often
have
deeply
regretted
the
infatuation
which
had
induced
her
to
bestow
her
hand
in
the
quarter
she
had
done
so
about
a
month
after
the
decease
of
mr
bannerworth
there
came
one
to
the
hall
who
desired
to
see
the
widow
that
one
was
mr
marchdale
it
might
have
been
some
slight
tenderness
towards
him
which
had
never
left
her
or
it
might
be
the
pleasure
merely
of
seeing
one
whom
she
had
known
intimately
in
early
life
but
be
that
as
it
may
she
certainly
gave
him
a
kindly
welcome
and
he
after
consenting
to
remain
for
some
time
as
a
visitor
at
the
hall
won
the
esteem
of
the
whole
family
by
his
frank
demeanour
and
cultivated
intellect
he
had
travelled
much
and
seen
much
and
he
had
turned
to
good
account
all
he
had
seen
so
that
not
only
was
mr
marchdale
a
man
of
sterling
sound
sense
but
he
was
a
most
entertaining
companion
his
intimate
knowledge
of
many
things
concerning
which
they
knew
little
or
nothing
his
accurate
modes
of
thought
and
a
quiet
gentlemanly
demeanour
such
as
is
rarely
to
be
met
with
combined
to
make
him
esteemed
by
the
bannerworths
he
had
a
small
independence
of
his
own
and
being
completely
alone
in
the
world
for
he
had
neither
wife
nor
child
marchdale
owned
that
he
felt
a
pleasure
in
residing
with
the
bannerworths
of
course
he
could
not
in
decent
terms
so
far
offend
them
as
to
offer
to
pay
for
his
subsistence
but
he
took
good
care
that
they
should
really
be
no
losers
by
having
him
as
an
inmate
a
matter
which
he
could
easily
arrange
by
little
presents
of
one
kind
and
another
all
of
which
he
managed
should
be
such
as
were
not
only
ornamental
but
actually
spared
his
kind
entertainers
some
positive
expense
which
otherwise
they
must
have
gone
to
whether
or
not
this
amiable
piece
of
manoeuvring
was
seen
through
by
the
bannerworths
it
is
not
our
purpose
to
inquire
if
it
was
seen
through
it
could
not
lower
him
in
their
esteem
for
it
was
probably
just
what
they
themselves
would
have
felt
a
pleasure
in
doing
under
similar
circumstances
and
if
they
did
not
observe
it
mr
marchdale
would
probably
be
all
the
better
pleased
such
then
may
be
considered
by
our
readers
as
a
brief
outline
of
the
state
of
affairs
among
the
bannerworths--a
state
which
was
pregnant
with
changes
and
which
changes
were
now
likely
to
be
rapid
and
conclusive
how
far
the
feelings
of
the
family
towards
the
ancient
house
of
their
race
would
be
altered
by
the
appearance
at
it
of
so
fearful
a
visitor
as
a
vampyre
we
will
not
stop
to
inquire
inasmuch
as
such
feelings
will
develop
themselves
as
we
proceed
that
the
visitation
had
produced
a
serious
effect
upon
all
the
household
was
sufficiently
evident
as
well
among
the
educated
as
among
the
ignorant
on
the
second
morning
henry
received
notice
to
quit
his
service
from
the
three
servants
he
with
difficulty
had
contrived
to
keep
at
the
hall
the
reason
why
he
received
such
notice
he
knew
well
enough
and
therefore
he
did
not
trouble
himself
to
argue
about
a
superstition
to
which
he
felt
now
himself
almost
compelled
to
give
way
for
how
could
he
say
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
vampyre
when
he
had
with
his
own
eyes
had
the
most
abundant
evidence
of
the
terrible
fact
he
calmly
paid
the
servants
and
allowed
them
to
leave
him
at
once
without
at
all
entering
into
the
matter
and
for
the
time
being
some
men
were
procured
who
however
came
evidently
with
fear
and
trembling
and
probably
only
took
the
place
on
account
of
not
being
able
to
procure
any
other
the
comfort
of
the
household
was
likely
to
be
completely
put
an
end
to
and
reasons
now
for
leaving
the
hall
appeared
to
be
most
rapidly
accumulating
the
visit
to
the
vault
of
the
bannerworths
and
its
unpleasant
result--the
mystery
illustration
henry
and
his
brother
roused
flora
and
after
agreeing
together
that
it
would
be
highly
imprudent
to
say
anything
to
her
of
the
proceedings
of
the
night
they
commenced
a
conversation
with
her
in
encouraging
and
kindly
accents
well
flora
said
henry
you
see
you
have
been
quite
undisturbed
to-night
i
have
slept
long
dear
henry
you
have
and
pleasantly
too
i
hope
i
have
not
had
any
dreams
and
i
feel
much
refreshed
now
and
quite
well
again
thank
heaven
said
george
if
you
will
tell
dear
mother
that
i
am
awake
i
will
get
up
with
her
assistance
the
brothers
left
the
room
and
they
spoke
to
each
other
of
it
as
a
favourable
sign
that
flora
did
not
object
to
being
left
alone
now
as
she
had
done
on
the
preceding
morning
she
is
fast
recovering
now
george
said
henry
if
we
could
now
but
persuade
ourselves
that
all
this
alarm
would
pass
away
and
that
we
should
hear
no
more
of
it
we
might
return
to
our
old
and
comparatively
happy
condition
let
us
believe
henry
that
we
shall
and
yet
george
i
shall
not
be
satisfied
in
my
mind
until
i
have
paid
a
visit
a
visit
where
to
the
family
vault
indeed
henry
i
thought
you
had
abandoned
that
idea
i
had
i
have
several
times
abandoned
it
but
it
comes
across
my
mind
again
and
again
i
much
regret
it
look
you
george
as
yet
everything
that
has
happened
has
tended
to
confirm
a
belief
in
this
most
horrible
of
all
superstitions
concerning
vampyres
it
has
now
my
great
object
george
is
to
endeavour
to
disturb
such
a
state
of
things
by
getting
something
however
slight
or
of
a
negative
character
for
the
mind
to
rest
upon
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
i
comprehend
you
henry
you
know
that
at
present
we
are
not
only
led
to
believe
almost
irresistibly
that
we
have
been
visited
here
by
a
vampyre
but
that
that
vampyre
is
our
ancestor
whose
portrait
is
on
the
panel
of
the
wall
of
the
chamber
into
which
he
contrived
to
make
his
way
true
most
true
then
let
us
by
an
examination
of
the
family
vault
george
put
an
end
to
one
of
the
evidences
if
we
find
as
most
surely
we
shall
the
coffin
of
the
ancestor
of
ours
who
seems
in
dress
and
appearance
so
horribly
mixed
up
in
this
affair
we
shall
be
at
rest
on
that
head
but
consider
how
many
years
have
elapsed
yes
a
great
number
what
then
do
you
suppose
could
remain
of
any
corpse
placed
in
a
vault
so
long
ago
decomposition
must
of
course
have
done
its
work
but
still
there
must
be
a
something
to
show
that
a
corpse
has
so
undergone
the
process
common
to
all
nature
double
the
lapse
of
time
surely
could
not
obliterate
all
traces
of
that
which
had
been
there
is
reason
in
that
henry
besides
the
coffins
are
all
of
lead
and
some
of
stone
so
that
they
cannot
have
all
gone
true
most
true
if
in
the
one
which
from
the
inscription
and
the
date
we
discover
to
be
that
of
our
ancestor
whom
we
seek
we
find
the
evident
remains
of
a
corpse
we
shall
be
satisfied
that
he
has
rested
in
his
tomb
in
peace
brother
you
seem
bent
on
this
adventure
said
george
if
you
go
i
will
accompany
you
i
will
not
engage
rashly
in
it
george
before
i
finally
decide
i
will
again
consult
with
mr
marchdale
his
opinion
will
weigh
much
with
me
and
in
good
time
here
he
comes
across
the
garden
said
george
as
he
looked
from
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
they
sat
it
was
mr
marchdale
and
the
brothers
warmly
welcomed
him
as
he
entered
the
apartment
you
have
been
early
afoot
said
henry
i
have
he
said
the
fact
is
that
although
at
your
solicitation
i
went
to
bed
i
could
not
sleep
and
i
went
out
once
more
to
search
about
the
spot
where
we
had
seen
the--the
i
don't
know
what
to
call
it
for
i
have
a
great
dislike
to
naming
it
a
vampyre
there
is
not
much
in
a
name
said
george
in
this
instance
there
is
said
marchdale
it
is
a
name
suggestive
of
horror
made
you
any
discovery
said
henry
none
whatever
you
saw
no
trace
of
any
one
not
the
least
well
mr
marchdale
george
and
i
were
talking
over
this
projected
visit
to
the
family
vault
yes
and
we
agreed
to
suspend
our
judgments
until
we
saw
you
and
learned
your
opinion
which
i
will
tell
you
frankly
said
mr
marchdale
because
i
know
you
desire
it
freely
do
so
it
is
that
you
make
the
visit
indeed
yes
and
for
this
reason
you
have
now
as
you
cannot
help
having
a
disagreeable
feeling
that
you
may
find
that
one
coffin
is
untenanted
now
if
you
do
find
it
so
you
scarcely
make
matters
worse
by
an
additional
confirmation
of
what
already
amounts
to
a
strong
supposition
and
one
which
is
likely
to
grow
stronger
by
time
true
most
true
on
the
contrary
if
you
find
indubitable
proofs
that
your
ancestor
has
slept
soundly
in
the
tomb
and
gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
you
will
find
yourselves
much
calmer
and
that
an
attack
is
made
upon
the
train
of
events
which
at
present
all
run
one
way
that
is
precisely
the
argument
i
was
using
to
george
said
henry
a
few
moments
since
then
let
us
go
said
george
by
all
means
it
is
so
decided
then
said
henry
let
it
be
done
with
caution
replied
mr
marchdale
if
any
one
can
manage
it
of
course
we
can
why
should
it
not
be
done
secretly
and
at
night
of
course
we
lose
nothing
by
making
a
night
visit
to
a
vault
into
which
daylight
i
presume
cannot
penetrate
certainly
not
then
let
it
be
at
night
but
we
shall
surely
require
the
concurrence
of
some
of
the
church
authorities
nay
i
do
not
see
that
interposed
mr
marchdale
it
is
the
vault
actually
vested
in
and
belonging
to
yourself
you
wish
to
visit
and
therefore
you
have
right
to
visit
it
in
any
manner
or
at
any
time
that
may
be
most
suitable
to
yourself
but
detection
in
a
clandestine
visit
might
produce
unpleasant
consequences
the
church
is
old
said
george
and
we
could
easily
find
means
of
getting
into
it
there
is
only
one
objection
that
i
see
just
now
and
that
is
that
we
leave
flora
unprotected
we
do
indeed
said
henry
i
did
not
think
of
that
it
must
be
put
to
herself
as
a
matter
for
her
own
consideration
said
mr
marchdale
if
she
will
consider
herself
sufficiently
safe
with
the
company
and
protection
of
your
mother
only
it
would
be
a
pity
were
we
not
all
three
present
at
the
examination
of
the
coffin
remarked
henry
it
would
indeed
there
is
ample
evidence
said
mr
marchdale
but
we
must
not
give
flora
a
night
of
sleeplessness
and
uneasiness
on
that
account
and
the
more
particularly
as
we
cannot
well
explain
to
her
where
we
are
going
or
upon
what
errand
certainly
not
let
us
talk
to
her
then
about
it
said
henry
i
confess
i
am
much
bent
upon
the
plan
and
fain
would
not
forego
it
neither
should
i
like
other
than
that
we
three
should
go
together
if
you
determine
then
upon
it
said
marchdale
we
will
go
to-night
and
from
your
acquaintance
with
the
place
doubtless
you
will
be
able
to
decide
what
tools
are
necessary
there
is
a
trap-door
at
the
bottom
of
the
pew
said
henry
it
is
not
only
secured
down
but
it
is
locked
likewise
and
i
have
the
key
in
my
possession
indeed
yes
immediately
beneath
is
a
short
flight
of
stone
steps
which
conduct
at
once
into
the
vault
is
it
large
no
about
the
size
of
a
moderate
chamber
and
with
no
intricacies
about
it
there
can
be
no
difficulties
then
none
whatever
unless
we
meet
with
actual
personal
interruption
which
i
am
inclined
to
think
is
very
far
from
likely
all
we
shall
require
will
be
a
screwdriver
with
which
to
remove
the
screws
and
then
something
with
which
to
wrench
open
the
coffin
those
we
can
easily
provide
along
with
lights
remarked
mr
marchdale
i
hope
to
heaven
that
this
visit
to
the
tomb
will
have
the
effect
of
easing
your
minds
and
enabling
you
to
make
a
successful
stand
against
the
streaming
torrent
of
evidence
that
has
poured
in
upon
us
regarding
this
most
fearful
of
apparitions
i
do
indeed
hope
so
added
henry
and
now
i
will
go
at
once
to
flora
and
endeavour
to
convince
her
she
is
safe
without
us
to-night
by-the-bye
i
think
said
marchdale
that
if
we
can
induce
mr
chillingworth
to
come
with
us
it
will
be
a
great
point
gained
in
the
investigation
he
would
said
henry
be
able
to
come
to
an
accurate
decision
with
respect
to
the
remains--if
any--in
the
coffin
which
we
could
not
then
have
him
by
all
means
said
george
he
did
not
seem
averse
last
night
to
go
on
such
an
adventure
i
will
ask
him
when
he
makes
his
visit
this
morning
upon
flora
and
should
he
not
feel
disposed
to
join
us
i
am
quite
sure
he
will
keep
the
secret
of
our
visit
all
this
being
arranged
henry
proceeded
to
flora
and
told
her
that
he
and
george
and
mr
marchdale
wished
to
go
out
for
about
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
evening
after
dark
if
she
felt
sufficiently
well
to
feel
a
sense
of
security
without
them
flora
changed
colour
and
slightly
trembled
and
then
as
if
ashamed
of
her
fears
she
said--
go
go
i
will
not
detain
you
surely
no
harm
can
come
to
me
in
presence
of
my
mother
we
shall
not
be
gone
longer
than
the
time
i
mention
to
you
said
henry
oh
i
shall
be
quite
content
besides
am
i
to
be
kept
thus
in
fear
all
my
life
surely
surely
not
i
ought
too
to
learn
to
defend
myself
henry
caught
at
the
idea
as
he
said--
if
fire-arms
were
left
you
do
you
think
you
would
have
courage
to
use
them
i
do
henry
then
you
shall
have
them
and
let
me
beg
of
you
to
shoot
any
one
without
the
least
hesitation
who
shall
come
into
your
chamber
i
will
henry
if
ever
human
being
was
justified
in
the
use
of
deadly
weapons
i
am
now
heaven
protect
me
from
a
repetition
of
the
visit
to
which
i
have
now
been
once
subjected
rather
oh
much
rather
would
i
die
a
hundred
deaths
than
suffer
what
i
have
suffered
do
not
allow
it
dear
flora
to
press
too
heavily
upon
your
mind
in
dwelling
upon
it
in
conversation
i
still
entertain
a
sanguine
expectation
that
something
may
arise
to
afford
a
far
less
dreadful
explanation
of
what
has
occurred
than
what
you
have
put
upon
it
be
of
good
cheer
flora
we
shall
go
one
hour
after
sunset
and
return
in
about
two
hours
from
the
time
at
which
we
leave
here
you
may
be
assured
notwithstanding
this
ready
and
courageous
acquiescence
of
flora
in
the
arrangement
henry
was
not
without
his
apprehension
that
when
the
night
should
come
again
her
fears
would
return
with
it
but
he
spoke
to
mr
chillingworth
upon
the
subject
and
got
that
gentleman's
ready
consent
to
accompany
them
he
promised
to
meet
them
at
the
church
porch
exactly
at
nine
o'clock
and
matters
were
all
arranged
and
henry
waited
with
much
eagerness
and
anxiety
now
for
the
coming
night
which
he
hoped
would
dissipate
one
of
the
fearful
deductions
which
his
imagination
had
drawn
from
recent
circumstances
he
gave
to
flora
a
pair
of
pistols
of
his
own
upon
which
he
knew
he
could
depend
and
he
took
good
care
to
load
them
well
so
that
there
could
be
no
likelihood
whatever
of
their
missing
fire
at
a
critical
moment
now
flora
he
said
i
have
seen
you
use
fire-arms
when
you
were
much
younger
than
you
are
now
and
therefore
i
need
give
you
no
instructions
if
any
intruder
does
come
and
you
do
fire
be
sure
you
take
a
good
aim
and
shoot
low
i
will
henry
i
will
and
you
will
be
back
in
two
hours
most
assuredly
i
will
the
day
wore
on
evening
came
and
then
deepened
into
night
it
turned
out
to
be
a
cloudy
night
and
therefore
the
moon's
brilliance
was
nothing
near
equal
to
what
it
had
been
on
the
preceding
night
still
however
it
had
sufficient
power
over
the
vapours
that
frequently
covered
it
for
many
minutes
together
to
produce
a
considerable
light
effect
upon
the
face
of
nature
and
the
night
was
consequently
very
far
indeed
from
what
might
be
called
a
dark
one
george
henry
and
marchdale
met
in
one
of
the
lower
rooms
of
the
house
previous
to
starting
upon
their
expedition
and
after
satisfying
themselves
that
they
had
with
them
all
the
tools
that
were
necessary
inclusive
of
the
same
small
but
well-tempered
iron
crow-bar
with
which
marchdale
had
on
the
night
of
the
visit
of
the
vampyre
forced
open
the
door
of
flora's
chamber
they
left
the
hall
and
proceeded
at
a
rapid
pace
towards
the
church
and
flora
does
not
seem
much
alarmed
said
marchdale
at
being
left
alone
no
replied
henry
she
has
made
up
her
mind
with
a
strong
natural
courage
which
i
knew
was
in
her
disposition
to
resist
as
much
as
possible
the
depressing
effects
of
the
awful
visitation
she
has
endured
it
would
have
driven
some
really
mad
it
would
indeed
and
her
own
reason
tottered
on
its
throne
but
thank
heaven
she
has
recovered
and
i
fervently
hope
that
through
her
life
added
marchdale
she
may
never
have
such
another
trial
we
will
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
such
a
thing
can
occur
twice
she
is
one
among
a
thousand
most
young
girls
would
never
at
all
have
recovered
the
fearful
shock
to
the
nerves
not
only
has
she
recovered
said
henry
but
a
spirit
which
i
am
rejoiced
to
see
because
it
is
one
which
will
uphold
her
of
resistance
now
possesses
her
yes
she
actually--i
forgot
to
tell
you
before--but
she
actually
asked
me
for
arms
to
resist
any
second
visitation
you
much
surprise
me
yes
i
was
surprised
as
well
as
pleased
myself
i
would
have
left
her
one
of
my
pistols
had
i
been
aware
of
her
having
made
such
a
request
do
you
know
if
she
can
use
fire-arms
oh
yes
well
what
a
pity
i
have
them
both
with
me
oh
she
is
provided
provided
yes
i
found
some
pistols
which
i
used
to
take
with
me
on
the
continent
and
she
has
them
both
well
loaded
so
that
if
the
vampyre
makes
his
appearance
he
is
likely
to
meet
with
rather
a
warm
reception
good
god
was
it
not
dangerous
not
at
all
i
think
well
you
know
best
certainly
of
course
i
hope
the
vampyre
may
come
and
that
we
may
have
the
pleasure
when
we
return
of
finding
him
dead
by-the-bye
i--i--
bless
me
i
have
forgot
to
get
the
materials
for
lights
which
i
pledged
myself
to
do
how
unfortunate
walk
on
slowly
while
i
run
back
and
get
them
oh
we
are
too
far--
hilloa
cried
a
man
at
this
moment
some
distance
in
front
of
them
it
is
mr
chillingworth
said
henry
hilloa
cried
the
worthy
doctor
again
is
that
you
my
friend
henry
bannerworth
it
is
cried
henry
mr
chillingworth
now
came
up
to
them
and
said--
i
was
before
my
time
so
rather
than
wait
at
the
church
porch
which
would
have
exposed
me
to
observation
perhaps
i
thought
it
better
to
walk
on
and
chance
meeting
with
you
you
guessed
we
should
come
this
way'
yes
and
so
it
turns
out
really
it
is
unquestionably
your
most
direct
route
to
the
church
i
think
i
will
go
back
said
mr
marchdale
back
exclaimed
the
doctor
what
for
i
forgot
the
means
of
getting
lights
we
have
candles
but
no
means
of
lighting
them
make
yourselves
easy
on
that
score
said
mr
chillingworth
i
am
never
without
some
chemical
matches
of
my
own
manufacture
so
that
as
you
have
the
candles
that
can
be
no
bar
to
our
going
on
a
once
that
is
fortunate
said
henry
very
added
marchdale
for
it
seems
a
mile's
hard
walking
for
me
or
at
least
half
a
mile
from
the
hall
let
us
now
push
on
they
did
push
on
all
four
walking
at
a
brisk
pace
the
church
although
it
belonged
to
the
village
was
not
in
it
on
the
contrary
it
was
situated
at
the
end
of
a
long
lane
which
was
a
mile
nearly
from
the
village
in
the
direction
of
the
hall
therefore
in
going
to
it
from
the
hall
that
amount
of
distance
was
saved
although
it
was
always
called
and
considered
the
village
church
it
stood
alone
with
the
exception
of
a
glebe
house
and
two
cottages
that
were
occupied
by
persons
who
held
situations
about
the
sacred
edifice
and
who
were
supposed
being
on
the
spot
to
keep
watch
and
ward
over
it
it
was
an
ancient
building
of
the
early
english
style
of
architecture
or
rather
norman
with
one
of
those
antique
square
short
towers
built
of
flint
stones
firmly
embedded
in
cement
which
from
time
had
acquired
almost
the
consistency
of
stone
itself
there
were
numerous
arched
windows
partaking
something
of
the
more
florid
gothic
style
although
scarcely
ornamental
enough
to
be
called
such
the
edifice
stood
in
the
centre
of
a
grave-yard
which
extended
over
a
space
of
about
half
an
acre
and
altogether
it
was
one
of
the
prettiest
and
most
rural
old
churches
within
many
miles
of
the
spot
many
a
lover
of
the
antique
and
of
the
picturesque
for
it
was
both
went
out
of
his
way
while
travelling
in
the
neighbourhood
to
look
at
it
and
it
had
an
extensive
and
well-deserved
reputation
as
a
fine
specimen
of
its
class
and
style
of
building
in
kent
to
the
present
day
are
some
fine
specimens
of
the
old
roman
style
of
church
building
and
although
they
are
as
rapidly
pulled
down
as
the
abuse
of
modern
architects
and
the
cupidity
of
speculators
and
the
vanity
of
clergymen
can
possibly
encourage
in
older
to
erect
flimsy
italianised
structures
in
their
stead
yet
sufficient
of
them
remain
dotted
over
england
to
interest
the
traveller
at
walesden
there
is
a
church
of
this
description
which
will
well
repay
a
visit
this
then
was
the
kind
of
building
into
which
it
was
the
intention
of
our
four
friends
to
penetrate
not
on
an
unholy
or
an
unjustifiable
errand
but
on
one
which
proceeding
from
good
and
proper
motives
it
was
highly
desirable
to
conduct
in
as
secret
a
manner
as
possible
the
moon
was
more
densely
covered
by
clouds
than
it
had
yet
been
that
evening
when
they
reached
the
little
wicket-gate
which
led
into
the
churchyard
through
which
was
a
regularly
used
thoroughfare
we
have
a
favourable
night
remarked
henry
for
we
are
not
so
likely
to
be
disturbed
and
now
the
question
is
how
are
we
to
get
in
said
mr
chillingworth
as
he
paused
and
glanced
up
at
the
ancient
building
the
doors
said
george
would
effectually
resist
us
how
can
it
be
done
then
the
only
way
i
can
think
of
said
henry
is
to
get
out
one
of
the
small
diamond-shaped
panes
of
glass
from
one
of
the
low
windows
and
then
we
can
one
of
us
put
in
our
hands
and
undo
the
fastening
which
is
very
simple
when
the
window
opens
like
a
door
and
it
is
but
a
step
into
the
church
a
good
way
said
marchdale
we
will
lose
no
time
they
walked
round
the
church
till
they
came
to
a
very
low
window
indeed
near
to
an
angle
of
the
wall
where
a
huge
abutment
struck
far
out
into
the
burial-ground
will
you
do
it
henry
said
george
yes
i
have
often
noticed
the
fastenings
just
give
me
a
slight
hoist
up
and
all
will
be
right
george
did
so
and
henry
with
his
knife
easily
bent
back
some
of
the
leadwork
which
held
in
one
of
the
panes
of
glass
and
then
got
it
out
whole
he
handed
it
down
to
george
saying--
take
this
george
we
can
easily
replace
it
when
we
leave
so
that
there
can
be
no
signs
left
of
any
one
having
been
here
at
all
george
took
the
piece
of
thick
dim-coloured
glass
and
in
another
moment
henry
had
succeeded
in
opening
the
window
and
the
mode
of
ingress
to
the
old
church
was
fair
and
easy
before
them
all
had
there
been
ever
so
many
i
wonder
said
marchdale
that
a
place
so
inefficiently
protected
has
never
been
robbed
no
wonder
at
all
remarked
mr
chillingworth
there
is
nothing
to
take
that
i
am
aware
of
that
would
repay
anybody
the
trouble
of
taking
indeed
not
an
article
the
pulpit
to
be
sure
is
covered
with
faded
velvet
but
beyond
that
and
an
old
box
in
which
i
believe
nothing
is
left
but
some
books
i
think
there
is
no
temptation
and
that
heaven
knows
is
little
enough
then
come
on
said
henry
be
careful
there
is
nothing
beneath
the
window
and
the
depth
is
about
two
feet
thus
guided
they
all
got
fairly
into
the
sacred
edifice
and
then
henry
closed
the
window
and
fastened
it
on
the
inside
as
he
said--
we
have
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
set
to
work
opening
a
way
into
the
vault
and
i
trust
that
heaven
will
pardon
me
for
thus
desecrating
the
tomb
of
my
ancestors
from
a
consideration
of
the
object
i
have
in
view
by
so
doing
it
does
seem
wrong
thus
to
tamper
with
the
secrets
of
the
tomb
remarked
mr
marchdale
the
secrets
of
a
fiddlestick
said
the
doctor
what
secrets
has
the
tomb
i
wonder
well
but
my
dear
sir--
nay
my
dear
sir
it
is
high
time
that
death
which
is
then
the
inevitable
fate
of
us
all
should
be
regarded
with
more
philosophic
eyes
than
it
is
there
are
no
secrets
in
the
tomb
but
such
as
may
well
be
endeavoured
to
be
kept
secret
what
do
you
mean
there
is
one
which
very
probably
we
shall
find
unpleasantly
revealed
which
is
that
the
not
over
pleasant
odour
of
decomposed
animal
remains--beyond
that
i
know
of
nothing
of
a
secret
nature
that
the
tomb
can
show
us
ah
your
profession
hardens
you
to
such
matters
and
a
very
good
thing
that
it
does
or
else
if
all
men
were
to
look
upon
a
dead
body
as
something
almost
too
dreadful
to
look
upon
and
by
far
too
horrible
to
touch
surgery
would
lose
its
value
and
crime
in
many
instances
of
the
most
obnoxious
character
would
go
unpunished
if
we
have
a
light
here
said
henry
we
shall
run
the
greatest
chance
in
the
world
of
being
seen
for
the
church
has
many
windows
do
not
have
one
then
by
any
means
said
mr
chillingworth
a
match
held
low
down
in
the
pew
may
enable
us
to
open
the
vault
that
will
be
the
only
plan
henry
led
them
to
the
pew
which
belonged
to
his
family
and
in
the
floor
of
which
was
the
trap
door
when
was
it
last
opened
inquired
marchdale
when
my
father
died
said
henry
some
ten
months
ago
now
i
should
think
the
screws
then
have
had
ample
time
to
fix
themselves
with
fresh
rust
here
is
one
of
my
chemical
matches
said
mr
chillingworth
as
he
suddenly
irradiated
the
pew
with
a
clear
and
beautiful
flame
that
lasted
about
a
minute
the
heads
of
the
screws
were
easily
discernible
and
the
short
time
that
the
light
lasted
had
enabled
henry
to
turn
the
key
he
had
brought
with
him
in
the
lock
i
think
that
without
a
light
now
he
said
i
can
turn
the
screws
well
can
you
yes
there
are
but
four
try
it
then
henry
did
so
and
from
the
screws
having
very
large
heads
and
being
made
purposely
for
the
convenience
of
removal
when
required
with
deep
indentations
to
receive
the
screw-driver
he
found
no
difficulty
in
feeling
for
the
proper
places
and
extracting
the
screws
without
any
more
light
than
was
afforded
to
him
from
the
general
whitish
aspect
of
the
heavens
now
mr
chillingworth
he
said
another
of
your
matches
if
you
please
i
have
all
the
screws
so
loose
that
i
can
pick
them
up
with
my
fingers
here
said
the
doctor
in
another
moment
the
pew
was
as
light
as
day
and
henry
succeeded
in
taking
out
the
few
screws
which
he
placed
in
his
pocket
for
their
greater
security
since
of
course
the
intention
was
to
replace
everything
exactly
as
it
was
found
in
order
that
not
the
least
surmise
should
arise
in
the
mind
of
any
person
that
the
vault
had
been
opened
and
visited
for
any
purpose
whatever
secretly
or
otherwise
let
us
descend
said
henry
there
is
no
further
obstacle
my
friends
let
us
descend
if
any
one
remarked
george
in
a
whisper
as
they
slowly
descended
the
stairs
which
conducted
into
the
vault--if
any
one
had
told
me
that
i
should
be
descending
into
a
vault
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
if
a
dead
body
which
had
been
nearly
a
century
there
was
removed
or
not
and
had
become
a
vampyre
i
should
have
denounced
the
idea
as
one
of
the
most
absurd
that
ever
entered
the
brain
of
a
human
being
we
are
the
very
slaves
of
circumstances
said
marchdale
and
we
never
know
what
we
may
do
or
what
we
may
not
what
appears
to
us
so
improbable
as
to
border
even
upon
the
impossible
at
one
time
is
at
another
the
only
course
of
action
which
appears
feasibly
open
to
us
to
attempt
to
pursue
they
had
now
reached
the
vault
the
floor
of
which
was
composed
of
flat
red
tiles
laid
in
tolerable
order
the
one
beside
the
other
as
henry
had
stated
the
vault
was
by
no
means
of
large
extent
indeed
several
of
the
apartments
for
the
living
at
the
hall
were
much
larger
than
was
that
one
destined
for
the
dead
the
atmosphere
was
dump
and
noisome
but
not
by
any
means
so
bad
as
might
have
been
expected
considering
the
number
of
months
which
had
elapsed
since
last
the
vault
was
opened
to
receive
one
of
its
ghastly
and
still
visitants
now
for
one
of
your
lights
mr
chillingworth
you
say
you
have
the
candles
i
think
marchdale
although
you
forgot
the
matches
i
have
they
are
here
marchdale
took
from
his
pocket
a
parcel
which
contained
several
wax
candles
and
when
it
was
opened
a
smaller
packet
fell
to
the
ground
why
these
are
instantaneous
matches
said
mr
chillingworth
as
he
lifted
the
small
packet
up
they
are
and
what
a
fruitless
journey
i
should
have
had
back
to
the
hall
said
mr
marchdale
if
you
had
not
been
so
well
provided
as
you
are
with
the
means
of
getting
a
light
these
matches
which
i
thought
i
had
not
with
me
have
been
in
the
hurry
of
departure
enclosed
you
see
with
the
candles
truly
i
should
have
hunted
for
them
at
home
in
vain
mr
chillingworth
lit
the
wax
candle
which
was
now
handed
to
him
by
marchdale
and
in
another
moment
the
vault
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
was
quite
clearly
discernible
the
coffin--the
absence
of
the
dead--the
mysterious
circumstance
and
the
consternation
of
george
illustration
they
were
all
silent
for
a
few
moments
as
they
looked
around
them
with
natural
feelings
of
curiosity
two
of
that
party
had
of
course
never
been
in
that
vault
at
all
and
the
brothers
although
they
had
descended
into
it
upon
the
occasion
nearly
a
year
before
of
their
father
being
placed
in
it
still
looked
upon
it
with
almost
as
curious
eyes
as
they
who
now
had
their
first
sight
of
it
if
a
man
be
at
all
of
a
thoughtful
or
imaginative
cast
of
mind
some
curious
sensations
are
sure
to
come
over
him
upon
standing
in
such
a
place
where
he
knows
around
him
lie
in
the
calmness
of
death
those
in
whose
veins
have
flowed
kindred
blood
to
him--who
bore
the
same
name
and
who
preceded
him
in
the
brief
drama
of
his
existence
influencing
his
destiny
and
his
position
in
life
probably
largely
by
their
actions
compounded
of
their
virtues
and
their
vices
henry
bannerworth
and
his
brother
george
were
just
the
kind
of
persons
to
feel
strongly
such
sensations
both
were
reflective
imaginative
educated
young
men
and
as
the
light
from
the
wax
candle
flashed
upon
their
faces
it
was
evident
how
deeply
they
felt
the
situation
in
which
they
were
placed
mr
chillingworth
and
marchdale
were
silent
they
both
knew
what
was
passing
in
the
minds
of
the
brothers
and
they
had
too
much
delicacy
to
interrupt
a
train
of
thought
which
although
from
having
no
affinity
with
the
dead
who
lay
around
they
could
not
share
in
yet
they
respected
henry
at
length
with
a
sudden
start
seemed
to
recover
himself
from
his
reverie
this
is
a
time
for
action
george
he
said
and
not
for
romantic
thought
let
us
proceed
yes
yes
said
george
and
he
advanced
a
step
towards
the
centre
of
the
vault
can
you
find
out
among
all
these
coffins
for
there
seem
to
be
nearly
twenty
said
mr
chillingworth
which
is
the
one
we
seek
i
think
we
may
replied
henry
some
of
the
earlier
coffins
of
our
race
i
know
were
made
of
marble
and
others
of
metal
both
of
which
materials
i
expect
would
withstand
the
encroaches
of
time
for
a
hundred
years
at
least
let
us
examine
said
george
there
were
shelves
or
niches
built
into
the
walls
all
round
on
which
the
coffins
were
placed
so
that
there
could
not
be
much
difficulty
in
a
minute
examination
of
them
all
the
one
after
the
other
when
however
they
came
to
look
they
found
that
decay's
offensive
fingers
had
been
more
busy
than
they
could
have
imagined
and
that
whatever
they
touched
of
the
earlier
coffins
crumbled
into
dust
before
their
very
fingers
in
some
cases
the
inscriptions
were
quite
illegible
and
in
others
the
plates
that
had
borne
them
had
fallen
on
to
the
floor
of
the
vault
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
to
which
coffin
they
belonged
of
course
the
more
recent
and
fresh-looking
coffins
they
did
not
examine
because
they
could
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
object
of
that
melancholy
visit
we
shall
arrive
at
no
conclusion
said
george
all
seems
to
have
rotted
away
among
those
coffins
where
we
might
expect
to
find
the
one
belonging
to
marmaduke
bannerworth
our
ancestor
here
is
a
coffin
plate
said
marchdale
taking
one
from
the
floor
he
handed
it
to
mr
chillingworth
who
upon
an
inspection
of
it
close
to
the
light
exclaimed--
it
must
have
belonged
to
the
coffin
you
seek
what
says
it
ye
mortale
remains
of
marmaduke
bannerworth
yeoman
god
reste
his
soule
ad
1540
it
is
the
plate
belonging
to
his
coffin
said
henry
and
now
our
search
is
fruitless
it
is
so
indeed
exclaimed
george
for
how
can
we
tell
to
which
of
the
coffins
that
have
lost
the
plates
this
one
really
belongs
i
should
not
be
so
hopeless
said
marchdale
i
have
from
time
to
time
in
the
pursuit
of
antiquarian
lore
which
i
was
once
fond
of
entered
many
vaults
and
i
have
always
observed
that
an
inner
coffin
of
metal
was
sound
and
good
while
the
outer
one
of
wood
had
rotted
away
and
yielded
at
once
to
the
touch
of
the
first
hand
that
was
laid
upon
it
but
admitting
that
to
be
the
case
said
henry
how
does
that
assist
us
in
the
identification
of
a
coffin
i
have
always
in
my
experience
found
the
name
and
rank
of
the
deceased
engraved
upon
the
lid
of
the
inner
coffin
as
well
as
being
set
forth
in
a
much
more
perishable
manner
on
the
plate
which
was
secured
to
the
outer
one
he
is
right
said
mr
chillingworth
i
wonder
we
never
thought
of
that
if
your
ancestor
was
buried
in
a
leaden
coffin
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
finding
which
it
is
henry
seized
the
light
and
proceeding
to
one
of
the
coffins
which
seemed
to
be
a
mass
of
decay
he
pulled
away
some
of
the
rotted
wood
work
and
then
suddenly
exclaimed--
you
are
quite
right
here
is
a
firm
strong
leaden
coffin
within
which
although
quite
black
does
not
otherwise
appear
to
have
suffered
what
is
the
inscription
on
that
said
george
with
difficulty
the
name
on
the
lid
was
deciphered
but
it
was
found
not
to
be
the
coffin
of
him
whom
they
sought
we
can
make
short
work
of
this
said
marchdale
by
only
examining
those
leaden
coffins
which
have
lost
the
plates
from
off
their
outer
cases
there
do
not
appear
to
be
many
in
such
a
state
he
then
with
another
light
which
he
lighted
from
the
one
that
henry
now
carried
commenced
actively
assisting
in
the
search
which
was
carried
on
silently
for
more
than
ten
minutes
suddenly
mr
marchdale
cried
in
a
tone
of
excitement--
i
have
found
it
it
is
here
they
all
immediately
surrounded
the
spot
where
he
was
and
then
he
pointed
to
the
lid
of
a
coffin
which
he
had
been
rubbing
with
his
handkerchief
in
order
to
make
the
inscription
more
legible
and
said--
see
it
is
here
by
the
combined
light
of
the
candles
they
saw
the
words--
marmaduke
bannerworth
yeoman
1640
yes
there
can
be
no
mistake
here
said
henry
this
is
the
coffin
and
it
shall
be
opened
i
have
the
iron
crowbar
here
said
marchdale
it
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
i
am
accustomed
to
the
use
of
it
shall
i
open
the
coffin
do
so--do
so
said
henry
they
stood
around
in
silence
while
mr
marchdale
with
much
care
proceeded
to
open
the
coffin
which
seemed
of
great
thickness
and
was
of
solid
lead
it
was
probably
the
partial
rotting
of
the
metal
in
consequence
of
the
damps
of
that
place
that
made
it
easier
to
open
the
coffin
than
it
otherwise
would
have
been
but
certain
it
was
that
the
top
came
away
remarkably
easily
indeed
so
easily
did
it
come
off
that
another
supposition
might
have
been
hazarded
namely
that
it
had
never
at
all
been
effectually
fastened
illustration
the
few
moments
that
elapsed
were
ones
of
very
great
suspense
to
every
one
there
present
and
it
would
indeed
be
quite
sure
to
assert
that
all
the
world
was
for
the
time
forgotten
in
the
absorbing
interest
which
appertained
to
the
affair
which
was
in
progress
the
candles
were
now
both
held
by
mr
chillingworth
and
they
were
so
held
as
to
cast
a
full
and
clear
light
upon
the
coffin
now
the
lid
slid
off
and
henry
eagerly
gazed
into
the
interior
there
lay
something
certainly
there
and
an
audible
thank
god
escaped
his
lips
the
body
is
there
exclaimed
george
all
right
said
marchdale
here
it
is
there
is
something
and
what
else
can
it
be
hold
the
lights
said
mr
chillingworth
hold
the
lights
some
of
you
let
us
be
quite
certain
george
took
the
lights
and
mr
chillingworth
without
any
hesitation
dipped
his
hands
at
once
into
the
coffin
and
took
up
some
fragments
of
rags
which
were
there
they
were
so
rotten
that
they
fell
to
pieces
in
his
grasp
like
so
many
pieces
of
tinder
there
was
a
death-like
pause
for
some
few
moments
and
then
mr
chillingworth
said
in
a
low
voice--
there
is
not
the
least
vestige
of
a
dead
body
here
henry
gave
a
deep
groan
as
he
said--
mr
chillingworth
can
you
take
upon
yourself
to
say
that
no
corpse
has
undergone
the
process
of
decomposition
in
this
coffin
to
answer
your
question
exactly
as
probably
in
your
hurry
you
have
worded
it
said
mr
chillingworth
i
cannot
take
upon
myself
to
say
any
such
thing
but
this
i
can
say
namely
that
in
this
coffin
there
are
no
animal
remains
and
that
it
is
quite
impossible
that
any
corpse
enclosed
here
could
in
any
lapse
of
time
have
so
utterly
and
entirely
disappeared
i
am
answered
said
henry
good
god
exclaimed
george
and
has
this
but
added
another
damning
proof
to
those
we
have
already
on
our
minds
of
one
of
the
must
dreadful
superstitions
that
ever
the
mind
of
man
conceived
it
would
seem
so
said
marchdale
sadly
oh
that
i
were
dead
this
is
terrible
god
of
heaven
why
are
these
things
oh
if
i
were
but
dead
and
so
spared
the
torture
of
supposing
such
things
possible
think
again
mr
chillingworth
i
pray
you
think
again
cried
marchdale
if
i
were
to
think
for
the
remainder
of
my
existence
he
replied
i
could
come
to
no
other
conclusion
it
is
not
a
matter
of
opinion
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
you
are
positive
then
said
henry
that
the
dead
body
of
marmaduke
bannerworth
is
not
rested
here
i
am
positive
look
for
yourselves
the
lead
is
but
slightly
discoloured
it
looks
tolerably
clean
and
fresh
there
is
not
a
vestige
of
putrefaction--no
bones
no
dust
even
they
did
all
look
for
themselves
and
the
most
casual
glance
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
most
sceptical
all
is
over
said
henry
let
us
now
leave
this
place
and
all
i
can
now
ask
of
you
my
friends
is
to
lock
this
dreadful
secret
deep
in
your
own
hearts
it
shall
never
pass
my
lips
said
marchdale
nor
mine
you
may
depend
said
the
doctor
i
was
much
in
hopes
that
this
night's
work
would
have
had
the
effect
of
dissipating
instead
of
adding
to
the
gloomy
fancies
that
now
possess
you
good
heavens
cried
george
can
you
call
them
fancies
mr
chillingworth
i
do
indeed
have
you
yet
a
doubt
my
young
friend
i
told
you
from
the
first
that
i
would
not
believe
in
your
vampyre
and
i
tell
you
now
that
if
one
was
to
come
and
lay
hold
of
me
by
the
throat
as
long
as
i
could
at
all
gasp
for
breath
i
would
tell
him
he
was
a
d----d
impostor
this
is
carrying
incredulity
to
the
verge
of
obstinacy
far
beyond
it
if
you
please
you
will
not
be
convinced
said
marchdale
i
most
decidedly
on
this
point
will
not
then
you
are
one
who
would
doubt
a
miracle
if
you
saw
it
with
your
own
eyes
i
would
because
i
do
not
believe
in
miracles
i
should
endeavour
to
find
some
rational
and
some
scientific
means
of
accounting
for
the
phenomenon
and
that's
the
very
reason
why
we
have
no
miracles
now-a-days
between
you
and
i
and
no
prophets
and
saints
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
would
rather
avoid
such
observations
in
such
a
place
as
this
said
marchdale
nay
do
not
be
the
moral
coward
cried
mr
chillingworth
to
make
your
opinions
or
the
expression
of
them
dependent
upon
any
certain
locality
i
know
not
what
to
think
said
henry
i
am
bewildered
quite
let
us
now
come
away
mr
marchdale
replaced
the
lid
of
the
coffin
and
then
the
little
party
moved
towards
the
staircase
henry
turned
before
he
ascended
and
glanced
back
into
the
vault
oh
he
said
if
i
could
but
think
there
had
been
some
mistake
some
error
of
judgment
on
which
the
mind
could
rest
for
hope
i
deeply
regret
said
marchdale
that
i
so
strenuously
advised
this
expedition
i
did
hope
that
from
it
would
have
resulted
much
good
and
you
had
every
reason
so
to
hope
said
chillingworth
i
advised
it
likewise
and
i
tell
you
that
its
result
perfectly
astonishes
me
although
i
will
not
allow
myself
to
embrace
at
once
all
the
conclusions
to
which
it
would
seem
to
lead
me
i
am
satisfied
said
henry
i
know
you
both
advised
me
for
the
best
the
curse
of
heaven
seems
now
to
have
fallen
upon
me
and
my
house
oh
nonsense
said
chillingworth
what
for
alas
i
know
not
then
you
may
depend
that
heaven
would
never
act
so
oddly
in
the
first
place
heaven
don't
curse
anybody
and
in
the
second
it
is
too
just
to
inflict
pain
where
pain
is
not
amply
deserved
they
ascended
the
gloomy
staircase
of
the
vault
the
countenances
of
both
george
and
henry
were
very
much
saddened
and
it
was
quite
evident
that
their
thoughts
were
by
far
too
busy
to
enable
them
to
enter
into
any
conversation
they
did
not
and
particularly
george
seem
to
hear
all
that
was
said
to
them
their
intellects
seemed
almost
stunned
by
the
unexpected
circumstance
of
the
disappearance
of
the
body
of
their
ancestor
all
along
they
had
although
almost
unknown
to
themselves
felt
a
sort
of
conviction
that
they
must
find
some
remains
of
marmaduke
bannerworth
which
would
render
the
supposition
even
in
the
most
superstitious
minds
that
he
was
the
vampyre
a
thing
totally
and
physically
impossible
but
now
the
whole
question
assumed
a
far
more
bewildering
shape
the
body
was
not
in
its
coffin--it
had
not
there
quietly
slept
the
long
sleep
of
death
common
to
humanity
where
was
it
then
what
had
become
of
it
where
how
and
under
what
circumstances
had
it
been
removed
had
it
itself
burst
the
bands
that
held
it
and
hideously
stalked
forth
into
the
world
again
to
make
one
of
its
seeming
inhabitants
and
kept
up
for
a
hundred
years
a
dreadful
existence
by
such
adventures
as
it
had
consummated
at
the
hall
where
in
the
course
of
ordinary
human
life
it
had
once
lived
all
these
were
questions
which
irresistibly
pressed
themselves
upon
the
consideration
of
henry
and
his
brother
they
were
awful
questions
and
yet
take
any
sober
sane
thinking
educated
man
and
show
him
all
that
they
had
seen
subject
him
to
all
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
and
say
if
human
reason
and
all
the
arguments
that
the
subtlest
brain
could
back
it
with
would
be
able
to
hold
out
against
such
a
vast
accumulation
of
horrible
evidences
and
say--i
don't
believe
it
mr
chillingworth's
was
the
only
plan
he
would
not
argue
the
question
he
said
at
once--
i
will
not
believe
this
thing--upon
this
point
i
will
yield
to
no
evidence
whatever
that
was
the
only
way
of
disposing
of
such
a
question
but
there
are
not
many
who
could
so
dispose
of
it
and
not
one
so
much
interested
in
it
as
were
the
brothers
bannerworth
who
could
at
all
hope
to
get
into
such
a
state
of
mind
the
boards
were
laid
carefully
down
again
and
the
screws
replaced
henry
found
himself
unequal
to
the
task
so
it
was
done
by
marchdale
who
took
pains
to
replace
everything
in
the
same
state
in
which
they
had
found
it
even
to
the
laying
even
the
matting
at
the
bottom
of
the
pew
then
they
extinguished
the
light
and
with
heavy
hearts
they
all
walked
towards
the
window
to
leave
the
sacred
edifice
by
the
same
means
they
had
entered
it
shall
we
replace
the
pane
of
glass
said
marchdale
oh
it
matters
not--it
matters
not
said
henry
listlessly
nothing
matters
now
i
care
not
what
becomes
of
me--i
am
getting
weary
of
a
life
which
now
must
be
one
of
misery
and
dread
you
must
not
allow
yourself
to
fall
into
such
a
state
of
mind
as
this
said
the
doctor
or
you
will
become
a
patient
of
mine
very
quickly
i
cannot
help
it
well
but
be
a
man
if
there
are
serious
evils
affecting
you
fight
out
against
them
the
best
way
you
can
i
cannot
come
now
listen
to
me
we
need
not
i
think
trouble
ourselves
about
the
pane
of
glass
so
come
along
he
took
the
arm
of
henry
and
walked
on
with
him
a
little
in
advance
of
the
others
henry
he
said
the
best
way
you
may
depend
of
meeting
evils
be
they
great
or
small
is
to
get
up
an
obstinate
feeling
of
defiance
against
them
now
when
anything
occurs
which
is
uncomfortable
to
me
i
endeavour
to
convince
myself
and
i
have
no
great
difficulty
in
doing
so
that
i
am
a
decidedly
injured
man
indeed
yes
i
get
very
angry
and
that
gets
up
a
kind
of
obstinacy
which
makes
me
not
feel
half
so
much
mental
misery
as
would
be
my
portion
if
i
were
to
succumb
to
the
evil
and
commence
whining
over
it
as
many
people
do
under
the
pretence
of
being
resigned
but
this
family
affliction
of
mine
transcends
anything
that
anybody
else
ever
endured
i
don't
know
that
but
it
is
a
view
of
the
subject
which
if
i
were
you
would
only
make
me
more
obstinate
what
can
i
do
in
the
first
place
i
would
say
to
myself
'there
may
or
there
may
not
be
supernatural
beings
who
from
some
physical
derangement
of
the
ordinary
nature
of
things
make
themselves
obnoxious
to
living
people
if
there
are
d--n
them
there
may
be
vampyres
and
if
there
are
i
defy
them'
let
the
imagination
paint
its
very
worst
terrors
let
fear
do
what
it
will
and
what
it
can
in
peopling
the
mind
with
horrors
shrink
from
nothing
and
even
then
i
would
defy
them
all
is
not
that
like
defying
heaven
most
certainly
not
for
in
all
we
say
and
in
all
we
do
we
act
from
the
impulses
of
that
mind
which
is
given
to
us
by
heaven
itself
if
heaven
creates
an
intellect
and
a
mind
of
a
certain
order
heaven
will
not
quarrel
that
it
does
the
work
which
it
was
adapted
to
do
i
know
these
are
your
opinions
i
have
heard
you
mention
them
before
they
are
the
opinions
of
every
rational
person
henry
bannerworth
because
they
will
stand
the
test
of
reason
and
what
i
urge
upon
you
is
not
to
allow
yourself
to
be
mentally
prostrated
even
if
a
vampyre
has
paid
a
visit
to
your
house
defy
him
say
i--fight
him
self-preservation
is
a
great
law
of
nature
implanted
in
all
our
hearts
do
you
summon
it
to
your
aid
i
will
endeavour
to
think
as
you
would
have
me
i
thought
more
than
once
of
summoning
religion
to
my
aid
well
that
is
religion
indeed
i
consider
so
and
the
most
rational
religion
of
all
all
that
we
read
about
religion
that
does
not
seem
expressly
to
agree
with
it
you
may
consider
as
an
allegory
but
mr
chillingworth
i
cannot
and
will
not
renounce
the
sublime
truths
of
scripture
they
may
be
incomprehensible
they
may
be
inconsistent
and
some
of
them
may
look
ridiculous
but
still
they
are
sacred
and
sublime
and
i
will
not
renounce
them
although
my
reason
may
not
accord
with
them
because
they
are
the
laws
of
heaven
no
wonder
this
powerful
argument
silenced
mr
chillingworth
who
was
one
of
those
characters
in
society
who
hold
most
dreadful
opinions
and
who
would
destroy
religious
beliefs
and
all
the
different
sects
in
the
world
if
they
could
and
endeavour
to
introduce
instead
some
horrible
system
of
human
reason
and
profound
philosophy
but
how
soon
the
religious
man
silences
his
opponent
and
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
because
his
opponent
says
no
more
upon
the
subject
he
does
so
because
he
is
disgusted
with
the
stupidity
of
the
other
no
it
is
because
he
is
completely
beaten
and
has
nothing
more
to
say
the
distance
now
between
the
church
and
the
hall
was
nearly
traversed
and
mr
chillingworth
who
was
a
very
good
man
notwithstanding
his
disbelief
in
certain
things
of
course
paved
the
way
for
him
to
hell
took
a
kind
leave
of
mr
marchdale
and
the
brothers
promising
to
call
on
the
following
morning
and
see
flora
henry
and
george
then
in
earnest
conversation
with
marchdale
proceeded
homewards
it
was
evident
that
the
scene
in
the
vault
had
made
a
deep
and
saddening
impression
upon
them
and
one
which
was
not
likely
easily
to
be
eradicated
the
occurrences
of
the
night
at
the
hall--the
second
appearance
of
the
vampyre
and
the
pistol-shot
illustration
despite
the
full
and
free
consent
which
flora
had
given
to
her
brothers
to
entrust
her
solely
to
the
care
of
her
mother
and
her
own
courage
at
the
hall
she
felt
greater
fear
creep
over
her
after
they
were
gone
than
she
chose
to
acknowledge
a
sort
of
presentiment
appeared
to
come
over
her
that
some
evil
was
about
to
occur
and
more
than
once
she
caught
herself
almost
in
the
act
of
saying--
i
wish
they
had
not
gone
mrs
bannerworth
too
could
not
be
supposed
to
be
entirely
destitute
of
uncomfortable
feelings
when
she
came
to
consider
how
poor
a
guard
she
was
over
her
beautiful
child
and
how
much
terror
might
even
deprive
of
the
little
power
she
had
should
the
dreadful
visitor
again
make
his
appearance
but
it
is
but
for
two
hours
thought
flora
and
two
hours
will
soon
pass
away
there
was
too
another
feeling
which
gave
her
some
degree
of
confidence
although
it
arose
from
a
bad
source
inasmuch
as
it
was
one
which
showed
powerfully
how
much
her
mind
was
dwelling
on
the
particulars
of
the
horrible
belief
in
the
class
of
supernatural
beings
one
of
whom
she
believed
had
visited
her
that
consideration
was
this
the
two
hours
of
absence
from
the
hall
of
its
male
inhabitants
would
be
from
nine
o'clock
until
eleven
and
those
were
not
the
two
hours
during
which
she
felt
that
she
would
be
most
timid
on
account
of
the
vampyre
it
was
after
midnight
before
she
thought
when
it
came
and
perhaps
it
may
not
be
able
to
come
earlier
it
may
not
have
the
power
until
that
time
to
make
its
hideous
visits
and
therefore
i
will
believe
myself
safe
she
had
made
up
her
mind
not
to
go
to
bed
until
the
return
of
her
brothers
and
she
and
her
mother
sat
in
a
small
room
that
was
used
as
a
breakfast-room
and
which
had
a
latticed
window
that
opened
on
to
the
lawn
this
window
had
in
the
inside
strong
oaken
shutters
which
had
been
fastened
as
securely
as
their
construction
would
admit
of
some
time
before
the
departure
of
the
brothers
and
mr
marchdale
on
that
melancholy
expedition
the
object
of
which
if
it
had
been
known
to
her
would
have
added
so
much
to
the
terrors
of
poor
flora
it
was
not
even
guessed
at
however
remotely
so
that
she
had
not
the
additional
affliction
of
thinking
that
while
she
was
sitting
there
a
prey
to
all
sorts
of
imaginative
terrors
they
were
perhaps
gathering
fresh
evidence
as
indeed
they
were
of
the
dreadful
reality
of
the
appearance
which
but
for
the
collateral
circumstances
attendant
upon
its
coming
and
its
going
she
would
fain
have
persuaded
herself
was
but
the
vision
of
a
dream
it
was
before
nine
that
the
brothers
started
but
in
her
own
mind
flora
gave
them
to
eleven
and
when
she
heard
ten
o'clock
sound
from
a
clock
which
stood
in
the
hall
she
felt
pleased
to
think
that
in
another
hour
they
would
surely
be
at
home
my
dear
said
her
mother
you
look
more
like
yourself
now
do
i
mother
yes
you
are
well
again
ah
if
i
could
forget--
time
my
dear
flora
will
enable
you
to
do
so
and
all
the
fear
of
what
made
you
so
unwell
will
pass
away
you
will
soon
forget
it
all
i
will
hope
to
do
so
be
assured
that
some
day
or
another
something
will
occur
as
henry
says
to
explain
all
that
has
happened
in
some
way
consistent
with
reason
and
the
ordinary
nature
of
things
my
dear
flora
oh
i
will
cling
to
such
a
belief
i
will
get
henry
upon
whose
judgment
i
know
i
can
rely
to
tell
me
so
and
each
time
that
i
hear
such
words
from
his
lips
i
will
contrive
to
dismiss
some
portion
of
the
terror
which
now
i
cannot
but
confess
clings
to
my
heart
flora
laid
her
hand
upon
her
mother's
arm
and
in
a
low
anxious
tone
of
voice
said--listen
mother
mrs
bannerworth
turned
pale
as
she
said--listen
to
what
dear
within
these
last
ten
minutes
said
flora
i
have
thought
three
or
four
times
that
i
heard
a
slight
noise
without
nay
mother
do
not
tremble--it
may
be
only
fancy
illustration
flora
herself
trembled
and
was
of
a
death-like
paleness
once
or
twice
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
brow
and
altogether
she
presented
a
picture
of
much
mental
suffering
they
now
conversed
in
anxious
whispers
and
almost
all
they
said
consisted
in
anxious
wishes
for
the
return
of
the
brothers
and
mr
marchdale
you
will
be
happier
and
more
assured
my
dear
with
some
company
said
mrs
bannerworth
shall
i
ring
for
the
servants
and
let
them
remain
in
the
room
with
us
until
they
who
are
our
best
safeguards
next
to
heaven
return
hush--hush--hush
mother
what
do
you
hear
i
thought--i
heard
a
faint
sound
i
heard
nothing
dear
listen
again
mother
surely
i
could
not
be
deceived
so
often
i
have
now
at
least
six
times
heard
a
sound
as
if
some
one
was
outside
by
the
windows
no
no
my
darling
do
not
think
your
imagination
is
active
and
in
a
state
of
excitement
it
is
and
yet--
believe
me
it
deceives
you
i
hope
to
heaven
it
does
there
was
a
pause
of
some
minutes'
duration
and
then
mrs
bannerworth
again
urged
slightly
the
calling
of
some
of
the
servants
for
she
thought
that
their
presence
might
have
the
effect
of
giving
a
different
direction
to
her
child's
thoughts
but
flora
saw
her
place
her
hand
upon
the
bell
and
she
said--
no
mother
no--not
yet
not
yet
perhaps
i
am
deceived
mrs
bannerworth
upon
this
sat
down
but
no
sooner
had
she
done
so
than
she
heartily
regretted
she
had
not
rung
the
bell
for
before
another
word
could
be
spoken
there
came
too
perceptibly
upon
their
ears
for
there
to
be
any
mistake
at
all
about
it
a
strange
scratching
noise
upon
the
window
outside
a
faint
cry
came
from
flora's
lips
as
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
great
agony--
oh
god--oh
god
it
has
come
again
mrs
bannerworth
became
faint
and
unable
to
move
or
speak
at
all
she
could
only
sit
like
one
paralysed
and
unable
to
do
more
than
listen
to
and
see
what
was
going
on
the
scratching
noise
continued
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
altogether
ceased
perhaps
under
ordinary
circumstances
such
a
sound
outside
the
window
would
have
scarcely
afforded
food
for
comment
at
all
or
if
it
had
it
would
have
been
attributed
to
some
natural
effect
or
to
the
exertions
of
some
bird
or
animal
to
obtain
admittance
to
the
house
but
there
had
occurred
now
enough
in
that
family
to
make
any
little
sound
of
wonderful
importance
and
these
things
which
before
would
have
passed
completely
unheeded
at
all
events
without
creating
much
alarm
were
now
invested
with
a
fearful
interest
when
the
scratching
noise
ceased
flora
spoke
in
a
low
anxious
whisper
as
she
said--
mother
you
heard
it
then
mrs
bannerworth
tried
to
speak
but
she
could
not
and
then
suddenly
with
a
loud
clash
the
bar
which
on
the
inside
appeared
to
fasten
the
shutters
strongly
fell
as
if
by
some
invisible
agency
and
the
shutters
now
but
for
the
intervention
of
the
window
could
be
easily
pushed
open
from
without
mrs
bannerworth
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
after
rocking
to
and
fro
for
a
moment
she
fell
off
her
chair
having
fainted
with
the
excess
of
terror
that
came
over
her
for
about
the
space
of
time
in
which
a
fast
speaker
could
count
twelve
flora
thought
her
reason
was
leaving
her
but
it
did
not
she
found
herself
recovering
and
there
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
window
looking
more
like
some
exquisitely-chiselled
statue
of
despair
than
a
being
of
flesh
and
blood
expecting
each
moment
to
have
its
eyes
blasted
by
some
horrible
appearance
such
as
might
be
supposed
to
drive
her
to
madness
and
now
again
came
the
strange
knocking
or
scratching
against
the
glass
of
the
window
this
continued
for
some
minutes
during
which
it
appeared
likewise
to
flora
that
some
confusion
was
going
on
at
another
part
of
the
house
for
she
fancied
she
heard
voices
and
the
banging
of
doors
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
must
have
sat
looking
at
the
shutters
of
that
window
a
long
time
before
she
saw
them
shake
and
then
one
wide
hinged
portion
of
them
slowly
opened
once
again
horror
appeared
to
be
on
the
point
of
producing
madness
in
her
brain
and
then
as
before
a
feeling
of
calmness
rapidly
ensued
she
was
able
to
see
plainly
that
something
was
by
the
window
but
what
it
was
she
could
not
plainly
discern
in
consequence
of
the
lights
she
had
in
the
room
a
few
moments
however
sufficed
to
settle
that
mystery
for
the
window
was
opened
and
a
figure
stood
before
her
one
glance
one
terrified
glance
in
which
her
whole
soul
was
concentrated
sufficed
to
shew
her
who
and
what
the
figure
was
there
was
the
tall
gaunt
form--there
was
the
faded
ancient
apparel--the
lustrous
metallic-looking
eyes--its
half-opened
month
exhibiting
the
tusk-like
teeth
it
was--yes
it
was--the
vampyre
it
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
at
her
and
then
in
the
hideous
way
it
had
attempted
before
to
speak
it
apparently
endeavoured
to
utter
some
words
which
it
could
not
make
articulate
to
human
ears
the
pistols
lay
before
flora
mechanically
she
raised
one
and
pointed
it
at
the
figure
it
advanced
a
step
and
then
she
pulled
the
trigger
a
stunning
report
followed
there
was
a
loud
cry
of
pain
and
the
vampyre
fled
the
smoke
and
the
confusion
that
was
incidental
to
the
spot
prevented
her
from
seeing
if
the
figure
walked
or
ran
away
she
thought
she
heard
a
crashing
sound
among
the
plants
outside
the
window
as
if
it
had
fallen
but
she
did
not
feel
quite
sure
it
was
no
effort
of
any
reflection
but
a
purely
mechanical
movement
that
made
her
raise
the
other
pistol
and
discharge
that
likewise
in
the
direction
the
vampyre
had
taken
then
casting
the
weapon
away
she
rose
and
made
a
frantic
rush
from
the
room
she
opened
the
door
and
was
dashing
out
when
she
found
herself
caught
in
the
circling
arms
of
some
one
who
either
had
been
there
waiting
or
who
had
just
at
that
moment
got
there
the
thought
that
it
was
the
vampyre
who
by
some
mysterious
means
had
got
there
and
was
about
to
make
her
his
prey
now
overcame
her
completely
and
she
sunk
into
a
state
of
utter
insensibility
on
the
moment
the
return
from
the
vault--the
alarm
and
the
search
around
the
hall
illustration
it
so
happened
that
george
and
henry
bannerworth
along
with
mr
marchdale
had
just
reached
the
gate
which
conducted
into
the
garden
of
the
mansion
when
they
all
were
alarmed
by
the
report
of
a
pistol
amid
the
stillness
of
the
night
it
came
upon
them
with
so
sudden
a
shock
that
they
involuntarily
paused
and
there
came
from
the
lips
of
each
an
expression
of
alarm
good
heavens
cried
george
can
that
be
flora
firing
at
any
intruder
it
must
be
cried
henry
she
has
in
her
possession
the
only
weapons
in
the
house
mr
marchdale
turned
very
pale
and
trembled
slightly
but
he
did
not
speak
on
on
cried
henry
for
god's
sake
let
us
hasten
on
as
he
spoke
he
cleared
the
gate
at
a
bound
and
at
a
terrific
pace
he
made
towards
the
house
passing
over
beds
and
plantations
and
flowers
heedlessly
so
that
he
went
the
most
direct
way
to
it
before
however
it
was
possible
for
any
human
speed
to
accomplish
even
half
of
the
distance
the
report
of
the
other
shot
came
upon
his
ears
and
he
even
fancied
he
heard
the
bullet
whistle
past
his
head
in
tolerably
close
proximity
this
supposition
gave
him
a
clue
to
the
direction
at
all
events
from
whence
the
shots
proceeded
otherwise
he
knew
not
from
which
window
they
were
fired
because
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
previous
to
leaving
home
to
inquire
in
which
room
flora
and
his
mother
were
likely
to
be
seated
waiting
his
return
he
was
right
as
regarded
the
bullet
it
was
that
winged
messenger
of
death
which
had
passed
his
head
in
such
very
dangerous
proximity
and
consequently
he
made
with
tolerable
accuracy
towards
the
open
window
from
whence
the
shots
had
been
fired
the
night
was
not
near
so
dark
as
it
had
been
although
even
yet
it
was
very
far
from
being
a
light
one
and
he
was
soon
enabled
to
see
that
there
was
a
room
the
window
of
which
was
wide
open
and
lights
burning
on
the
table
within
he
made
towards
it
in
a
moment
and
entered
it
to
his
astonishment
the
first
objects
he
beheld
were
flora
and
a
stranger
who
was
now
supporting
her
in
his
arms
to
grapple
him
by
the
throat
was
the
work
of
a
moment
but
the
stranger
cried
aloud
in
a
voice
which
sounded
familiar
to
harry--
good
god
are
you
all
mad
henry
relaxed
his
hold
and
looked
in
his
face
gracious
heavens
it
is
mr
holland
he
said
yes
did
you
not
know
me
henry
was
bewildered
he
staggered
to
a
seat
and
in
doing
so
he
saw
his
mother
stretched
apparently
lifeless
upon
the
floor
to
raise
her
was
the
work
of
a
moment
and
then
marchdale
and
george
who
had
followed
him
as
fast
as
they
could
appeared
at
the
open
window
such
a
strange
scene
as
that
small
room
now
exhibited
had
never
been
equalled
in
bannerworth
hall
there
was
young
mr
holland
of
whom
mention
has
already
been
made
as
the
affianced
lover
of
flora
supporting
her
fainting
form
there
was
henry
doing
equal
service
to
his
mother
and
on
the
floor
lay
the
two
pistols
and
one
of
the
candles
which
had
been
upset
in
the
confusion
while
the
terrified
attitudes
of
george
and
mr
marchdale
at
the
window
completed
the
strange-looking
picture
what
is
this--oh
what
has
happened
cried
george
i
know
not--i
know
not
said
henry
some
one
summon
the
servants
i
am
nearly
mad
mr
marchdale
at
once
rung
the
bell
for
george
looked
so
faint
and
ill
as
to
be
incapable
of
doing
so
and
he
rung
it
so
loudly
and
so
effectually
that
the
two
servants
who
had
been
employed
suddenly
upon
the
others
leaving
came
with
much
speed
to
know
what
was
the
matter
see
to
your
mistress
said
henry
she
is
dead
or
has
fainted
for
god's
sake
let
who
can
give
me
some
account
of
what
has
caused
all
this
confusion
here
are
you
aware
henry
said
marchdale
that
a
stranger
is
present
in
the
room
he
pointed
to
mr
holland
as
he
spoke
who
before
henry
could
reply
said--
sir
i
may
be
a
stranger
to
you
as
you
are
to
me
and
yet
no
stranger
to
those
whose
home
this
is
no
no
said
henry
you
are
no
stranger
to
us
mr
holland
but
are
thrice
welcome--none
can
be
more
welcome
mr
marchdale
this
is
mr
holland
of
whom
you
have
heard
me
speak
i
am
proud
to
know
you
sir
said
marchdale
sir
i
thank
you
replied
holland
coldly
it
will
so
happen
but
at
first
sight
it
appeared
as
if
those
two
persons
had
some
sort
of
antagonistic
feeling
towards
each
other
which
threatened
to
prevent
effectually
their
ever
becoming
intimate
friends
the
appeal
of
henry
to
the
servants
to
know
if
they
could
tell
him
what
had
occurred
was
answered
in
the
negative
all
they
knew
was
that
they
had
heard
two
shots
fired
and
that
since
then
they
had
remained
where
they
were
in
a
great
fright
until
the
bell
was
rung
violently
this
was
no
news
at
all
and
therefore
the
only
chance
was
to
wait
patiently
for
the
recovery
of
the
mother
or
of
flora
from
one
or
the
other
of
whom
surely
some
information
could
be
at
once
then
procured
mrs
bannerworth
was
removed
to
her
own
room
and
so
would
flora
have
been
but
mr
holland
who
was
supporting
her
in
his
arms
said--
i
think
the
air
from
the
open
window
is
recovering
her
and
it
is
likely
to
do
so
oh
do
not
now
take
her
from
me
after
so
long
an
absence
flora
flora
look
up
do
you
not
know
me
you
have
not
yet
given
me
one
look
of
acknowledgment
flora
dear
flora
the
sound
of
his
voice
seemed
to
act
as
the
most
potent
of
charms
in
restoring
her
to
consciousness
it
broke
through
the
death-like
trance
in
which
she
lay
and
opening
her
beautiful
eyes
she
fixed
them
upon
his
face
saying--
yes
yes
it
is
charles--it
is
charles
she
burst
into
a
hysterical
flood
of
tears
and
clung
to
him
like
some
terrified
child
to
its
only
friend
in
the
whole
wide
world
oh
my
dear
friends
cried
charles
holland
do
not
deceive
me
has
flora
been
ill
we
have
all
been
ill
said
george
all
ill
ay
and
nearly
mad
exclaimed
harry
holland
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
surprise
as
well
he
might
nor
was
that
surprise
at
all
lessened
when
flora
made
an
effort
to
extricate
herself
from
his
embrace
as
she
exclaimed--
you
must
leave
me--you
must
leave
me
charles
for
ever
oh
never
never
look
upon
my
face
again
i--i
am
bewildered
said
charles
leave
me
now
continued
flora
think
me
unworthy
think
what
you
will
charles
but
i
cannot
i
dare
not
now
be
yours
is
this
a
dream
oh
would
it
were
charles
if
we
had
never
met
you
would
be
happier--i
could
not
be
more
wretched
flora
flora
do
you
say
these
words
of
so
great
cruelty
to
try
my
love
no
as
heaven
is
my
judge
i
do
not
gracious
heaven
then
what
do
they
mean
flora
shuddered
and
henry
coming
up
to
her
took
her
hand
in
his
tenderly
as
he
said--
has
it
been
again
it
has
you
shot
it
i
fired
full
upon
it
henry
but
it
fled
it
did--fly
it
did
henry
but
it
will
come
again--it
will
be
sure
to
come
again
you--you
hit
it
with
the
bullet
interposed
mr
marchdale
perhaps
you
killed
it
i
think
i
must
have
hit
it
unless
i
am
mad
charles
holland
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
such
a
look
of
intense
surprise
that
george
remarked
it
and
said
at
once
to
him--
mr
holland
a
full
explanation
is
due
to
you
and
you
shall
have
it
you
seem
the
only
rational
person
here
said
charles
pray
what
is
it
that
everybody
calls
'it'
hush--hush
said
henry
you
shall
hear
soon
but
not
at
present
hear
me
charles
said
flora
from
this
moment
mind
i
do
release
you
from
every
vow
from
every
promise
made
to
me
of
constancy
and
love
and
if
you
are
wise
charles
and
will
be
advised
you
will
now
this
moment
leave
this
house
never
to
return
to
it
no
said
charles--no
by
heaven
i
love
you
flora
i
have
come
to
say
again
all
that
in
another
clime
i
said
with
joy
to
you
when
i
forget
you
let
what
trouble
may
oppress
you
may
god
forget
me
and
my
own
right
hand
forget
to
do
me
honest
service
illustration
oh
no
more--no
more
sobbed
flora
yes
much
more
if
you
will
tell
me
of
words
which
shall
be
stronger
than
others
in
which
to
paint
my
love
my
faith
and
my
constancy
be
prudent
said
henry
say
no
more
nay
upon
such
a
theme
i
could
speak
for
ever
you
may
cast
me
off
flora
but
until
you
tell
me
you
love
another
i
am
yours
till
the
death
and
then
with
a
sanguine
hope
at
my
heart
that
we
shall
meet
again
never
dearest
to
part
flora
sobbed
bitterly
oh
she
said
this
is
the
unkindest
blow
of
all--this
is
worse
than
all
unkind
echoed
holland
heed
her
not
said
henry
she
means
not
you
oh
no--no
she
cried
farewell
charles--dear
charles
oh
say
that
word
again
he
exclaimed
with
animation
it
is
the
first
time
such
music
has
met
my
ears
it
must
be
the
last
no
no--oh
no
for
your
own
sake
i
shall
be
able
now
charles
to
show
you
that
i
really
loved
you
not
by
casting
me
from
you
yes
even
so
that
will
be
the
way
to
show
you
that
i
love
you
she
held
up
her
hands
wildly
as
she
added
in
an
excited
voice--
the
curse
of
destiny
is
upon
me
i
am
singled
out
as
one
lost
and
accursed
oh
horror--horror
would
that
i
were
dead
charles
staggered
back
a
pace
or
two
until
he
came
to
the
table
at
which
he
clutched
for
support
he
turned
very
pale
as
he
said
in
a
faint
voice--
is--is
she
mad
or
am
i
tell
him
i
am
mad
henry
cried
flora
do
not
oh
do
not
make
his
lonely
thoughts
terrible
with
more
than
that
tell
him
i
am
mad
come
with
me
whispered
henry
to
holland
i
pray
you
come
with
me
at
once
and
you
shall
know
all
i--will
george
stay
with
flora
for
a
time
come
come
mr
holland
you
ought
and
you
shall
know
all
then
you
can
come
to
a
judgment
for
yourself
this
way
sir
you
cannot
in
the
wildest
freak
of
your
imagination
guess
that
which
i
have
now
to
tell
you
never
was
mortal
man
so
utterly
bewildered
by
the
events
of
the
last
hour
of
his
existence
as
was
now
charles
holland
and
truly
he
might
well
be
so
he
had
arrived
in
england
and
made
what
speed
he
could
to
the
house
of
a
family
whom
he
admired
for
their
intelligence
their
high
culture
and
in
one
member
of
which
his
whole
thoughts
of
domestic
happiness
in
this
world
were
centered
and
he
found
nothing
but
confusion
incoherence
mystery
and
the
wildest
dismay
well
might
he
doubt
if
he
were
sleeping
or
waking--well
might
he
ask
if
he
or
they
were
mad
and
now
as
after
a
long
lingering
look
of
affection
upon
the
pale
suffering
face
of
flora
he
followed
henry
from
the
room
his
thoughts
were
busy
in
fancying
a
thousand
vague
and
wild
imaginations
with
respect
to
the
communication
which
was
promised
to
be
made
to
him
but
as
henry
had
truly
said
to
him
not
in
the
wildest
freak
of
his
imagination
could
he
conceive
of
any
thing
near
the
terrible
strangeness
and
horror
of
that
which
he
had
to
tell
him
and
consequently
he
found
himself
closeted
with
henry
in
a
small
private
room
removed
from
the
domestic
part
of
the
hall
to
the
full
in
as
bewildered
a
state
as
he
had
been
from
the
first
the
communications
to
the
lover--the
heart's
despair
illustration
consternation
is
sympathetic
and
any
one
who
had
looked
upon
the
features
of
charles
holland
now
that
he
was
seated
with
henry
bannerworth
in
expectation
of
a
communication
which
his
fears
told
him
was
to
blast
all
his
dearest
and
most
fondly
cherished
hopes
for
ever
would
scarce
have
recognised
in
him
the
same
young
man
who
one
short
hour
before
had
knocked
so
loudly
and
so
full
of
joyful
hope
and
expectation
at
the
door
of
the
hall
but
so
it
was
he
knew
henry
bannerworth
too
well
to
suppose
that
any
unreal
cause
could
blanch
his
cheek
he
knew
flora
too
well
to
imagine
for
one
moment
that
caprice
had
dictated
the
to
him
fearful
words
of
dismissal
she
had
uttered
to
him
happier
would
it
at
that
time
have
been
for
charles
holland
had
she
acted
capriciously
towards
him
and
convinced
him
that
his
true
heart's
devotion
had
been
cast
at
the
feet
of
one
unworthy
of
so
really
noble
a
gift
pride
would
then
have
enabled
him
no
doubt
successfully
to
resist
the
blow
a
feeling
of
honest
and
proper
indignation
at
having
his
feelings
trifled
with
would
no
doubt
have
sustained
him
but
alas
the
case
seemed
widely
different
true
she
implored
him
to
think
of
her
no
more--no
longer
to
cherish
in
his
breast
the
fond
dream
of
affection
which
had
been
its
guest
so
long
but
the
manner
in
which
she
did
so
brought
along
with
it
an
irresistible
conviction
that
she
was
making
a
noble
sacrifice
of
her
own
feelings
for
him
from
some
cause
which
was
involved
in
the
profoundest
mystery
but
now
he
was
to
hear
all
henry
had
promised
to
tell
him
and
as
he
looked
into
his
pale
but
handsomely
intellectual
face
he
half
dreaded
the
disclosure
he
yet
panted
to
hear
tell
me
all
henry--tell
me
all
he
said
upon
the
words
that
come
from
your
lips
i
know
i
can
rely
i
will
have
no
reservations
with
you
said
henry
sadly
you
ought
to
know
all
and
you
shall
prepare
yourself
for
the
strangest
revelation
you
ever
heard
indeed
ay
one
which
in
hearing
you
may
well
doubt
and
one
which
i
hope
you
will
never
find
an
opportunity
of
verifying
you
speak
in
riddles
and
yet
speak
truly
charles
you
heard
with
what
a
frantic
vehemence
flora
desired
you
to
think
no
more
of
her
i
did--i
did
she
was
right
she
is
a
noble-hearted
girl
for
uttering
those
words
a
dreadful
incident
in
our
family
has
occurred
which
might
well
induce
you
to
pause
before
uniting
your
fate
with
that
of
any
member
of
it
impossible
nothing
can
possibly
subdue
the
feelings
of
affection
i
entertain
for
flora
she
is
worthy
of
any
one
and
as
such
amid
all
changes--all
mutations
of
fortune
she
shall
be
mine
do
not
suppose
that
any
change
of
fortune
has
produced
the
scene
you
were
witness
to
then
what
else
i
will
tell
you
holland
in
all
your
travels
and
in
all
your
reading
did
you
ever
come
across
anything
about
vampyres
about
what
cried
charles
drawing
his
chair
forward
a
little
about
what
you
may
well
doubt
the
evidence
of
your
own
ears
charles
holland
and
wish
me
to
repeat
what
i
said
i
say
do
you
know
anything
about
vampyres
charles
holland
looked
curiously
in
henry's
face
and
the
latter
immediately
added--
i
can
guess
what
is
passing
in
your
mind
at
present
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
you
think
i
must
be
mad
well
really
henry
your
extraordinary
question--
i
knew
it
were
i
you
i
should
hesitate
to
believe
the
tale
but
the
fact
is
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
one
member
of
our
own
family
is
one
of
those
horrible
preternatural
beings
called
vampyres
good
god
henry
can
you
allow
your
judgment
for
a
moment
to
stoop
to
such
a
supposition
that
is
what
i
have
asked
myself
a
hundred
times
but
charles
holland
the
judgment
the
feelings
and
all
the
prejudices
natural
and
acquired
must
succumb
to
actual
ocular
demonstration
listen
to
me
and
do
not
interrupt
me
you
shall
know
all
and
you
shall
know
it
circumstantially
henry
then
related
to
the
astonished
charles
holland
all
that
had
occurred
from
the
first
alarm
of
flora
up
to
that
period
when
he
holland
caught
her
in
his
arms
as
she
was
about
to
leave
the
room
and
now
he
said
in
conclusion
i
cannot
tell
what
opinion
you
may
come
to
as
regards
these
most
singular
events
you
will
recollect
that
here
is
the
unbiassed
evidence
of
four
or
five
people
to
the
facts
and
beyond
that
the
servants
who
have
seen
something
of
the
horrible
visitor
you
bewilder
me
utterly
said
charles
holland
as
we
are
all
bewildered
but--but
gracious
heaven
it
cannot
be
it
is
no--no
there
is--there
must
be
yet
some
dreadful
mistake
can
you
start
any
supposition
by
which
we
can
otherwise
explain
any
of
the
phenomena
i
have
described
to
you
if
you
can
for
heaven's
sake
do
so
and
you
will
find
no
one
who
will
cling
to
it
with
more
tenacity
than
i
any
other
species
or
kind
of
supernatural
appearance
might
admit
of
argument
but
this
to
my
perception
is
too
wildly
improbable--too
much
at
variance
with
all
we
see
and
know
of
the
operations
of
nature
it
is
so
all
that
we
have
told
ourselves
repeatedly
and
yet
is
all
human
reason
at
once
struck
down
by
the
few
brief
words
of--'we
have
seen
it'
i
would
doubt
my
eyesight
one
might
but
many
cannot
be
labouring
under
the
same
delusion
my
friend
i
pray
you
do
not
make
me
shudder
at
the
supposition
that
such
a
dreadful
thing
as
this
is
at
all
possible
i
am
believe
me
charles
most
unwilling
to
oppress
anyone
with
the
knowledge
of
these
evils
but
you
are
so
situated
with
us
that
you
ought
to
know
and
you
will
clearly
understand
that
you
may
with
perfect
honour
now
consider
yourself
free
from
all
engagements
you
have
entered
into
with
flora
no
no
by
heaven
no
yes
charles
reflect
upon
the
consequences
now
of
a
union
with
such
a
family
oh
henry
bannerworth
can
you
suppose
me
so
dead
to
all
good
feeling
so
utterly
lost
to
honourable
impulses
as
to
eject
from
my
heart
her
who
has
possession
of
it
entirely
on
such
a
ground
as
this
you
would
be
justified
coldly
justified
in
prudence
i
might
be
there
are
a
thousand
circumstances
in
which
a
man
may
be
justified
in
a
particular
course
of
action
and
that
course
yet
may
be
neither
honourable
nor
just
i
love
flora
and
were
she
tormented
by
the
whole
of
the
supernatural
world
i
should
still
love
her
nay
it
becomes
then
a
higher
and
a
nobler
duty
on
my
part
to
stand
between
her
and
those
evils
if
possible
charles--charles
said
henry
i
cannot
of
course
refuse
to
you
my
meed
of
praise
and
admiration
for
your
generosity
of
feeling
but
remember
if
we
are
compelled
despite
all
our
feelings
and
all
our
predilections
to
the
contrary
to
give
in
to
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
vampyres
why
may
we
not
at
once
receive
as
the
truth
all
that
is
recorded
of
them
to
what
do
you
allude
to
this
that
one
who
has
been
visited
by
a
vampyre
and
whose
blood
has
formed
a
horrible
repast
for
such
a
being
becomes
after
death
one
of
the
dreadful
race
and
visits
others
in
the
same
way
now
this
must
be
insanity
cried
charles
it
bears
the
aspect
of
it
indeed
said
henry
oh
that
you
could
by
some
means
satisfy
yourself
that
i
am
mad
there
may
be
insanity
in
this
family
thought
charles
with
such
an
exquisite
pang
of
misery
that
he
groaned
aloud
already
added
henry
mournfully
already
the
blighting
influence
of
the
dreadful
tale
is
upon
you
charles
oh
let
me
add
my
advice
to
flora's
entreaties
she
loves
you
and
we
all
esteem
you
fly
then
from
us
and
leave
us
to
encounter
our
miseries
alone
fly
from
us
charles
holland
and
take
with
you
our
best
wishes
for
happiness
which
you
cannot
know
here
never
cried
charles
i
devote
my
existence
to
flora
i
will
not
play
the
coward
and
fly
from
one
whom
i
love
on
such
grounds
i
devote
my
life
to
her
henry
could
not
speak
for
emotion
for
several
minutes
and
when
at
length
in
a
faltering
voice
he
could
utter
some
words
he
said--
god
of
heaven
what
happiness
is
marred
by
these
horrible
events
what
have
we
all
done
to
be
the
victims
of
such
a
dreadful
act
of
vengeance
henry
do
not
talk
in
that
way
cried
charles
rather
let
us
bend
all
our
energies
to
overcoming
the
evil
than
spend
any
time
in
useless
lamentations
i
cannot
even
yet
give
in
to
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
such
a
being
as
you
say
visited
flora
but
the
evidences
look
you
here
henry
until
i
am
convinced
that
some
things
have
happened
which
it
is
totally
impossible
could
happen
by
any
human
means
whatever
i
will
not
ascribe
them
to
supernatural
influence
but
what
human
means
charles
could
produce
what
i
have
now
narrated
to
you
i
do
not
know
just
at
present
but
i
will
give
the
subject
the
most
attentive
consideration
will
you
accommodate
me
here
for
a
time
you
know
you
are
as
welcome
here
as
if
the
house
were
your
own
and
all
that
it
contains
i
believe
so
most
truly
you
have
no
objection
i
presume
to
my
conversing
with
flora
upon
this
strange
subject
certainly
not
of
course
you
will
be
careful
to
say
nothing
which
can
add
to
her
fears
i
shall
be
most
guarded
believe
me
you
say
that
your
brother
george
mr
chillingworth
yourself
and
this
mr
marchdale
have
all
been
cognisant
of
the
circumstances
yes--yes
then
with
the
whole
of
them
you
permit
me
to
hold
free
communication
upon
the
subject
most
certainly
i
will
do
so
then
keep
up
good
heart
henry
and
this
affair
which
looks
so
full
of
terror
at
first
sight
may
yet
be
divested
of
some
of
its
hideous
aspect
i
am
rejoiced
if
anything
can
rejoice
me
now
said
henry
to
see
you
view
the
subject
with
so
much
philosophy
why
said
charles
you
made
a
remark
of
your
own
which
enabled
me
viewing
the
matter
in
its
very
worst
and
most
hideous
aspect
to
gather
hope
what
was
that
you
said
properly
and
naturally
enough
that
if
ever
we
felt
that
there
was
such
a
weight
of
evidence
in
favour
of
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
vampyres
that
we
are
compelled
to
succumb
to
it
we
might
as
well
receive
all
the
popular
feelings
and
superstitions
concerning
them
likewise
i
did
where
is
the
mind
to
pause
when
once
we
open
it
to
the
reception
of
such
things
well
then
if
that
be
the
case
we
will
watch
this
vampyre
and
catch
it
catch
it
yes
surely
it
can
be
caught
as
i
understand
this
species
of
being
is
not
like
an
apparition
that
may
be
composed
of
thin
air
and
utterly
impalpable
to
the
human
touch
but
it
consists
of
a
revivified
corpse
yes
yes
then
it
is
tangible
and
destructible
by
heaven
if
ever
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
any
such
thing
it
shall
drag
me
to
its
home
be
that
where
it
may
or
i
will
make
it
prisoner
oh
charles
you
know
not
the
feeling
of
horror
that
will
come
across
you
when
you
do
you
have
no
idea
of
how
the
warm
blood
will
seem
to
curdle
in
your
veins
and
how
you
will
be
paralysed
in
every
limb
did
you
feel
so
i
did
i
will
endeavour
to
make
head
against
such
feelings
the
love
of
flora
shall
enable
me
to
vanquish
them
think
you
it
will
come
again
to-morrow
illustration
i
can
have
no
thought
the
one
way
or
the
other
it
may
we
must
arrange
among
us
all
henry
some
plan
of
watching
which
without
completely
prostrating
our
health
and
strength
will
always
provide
that
one
shall
be
up
all
night
and
on
the
alert
it
must
be
done
flora
ought
to
sleep
with
the
consciousness
now
that
she
has
ever
at
hand
some
intrepid
and
well-armed
protector
who
is
not
only
himself
prepared
to
defend
her
but
who
can
in
a
moment
give
an
alarm
to
us
all
in
case
of
necessity
requiring
it
it
would
be
a
dreadful
capture
to
make
to
seize
a
vampyre
said
henry
not
at
all
it
would
be
a
very
desirable
one
being
a
corpse
revivified
it
is
capable
of
complete
destruction
so
as
to
render
it
no
longer
a
scourge
to
any
one
charles
charles
are
you
jesting
with
me
or
do
you
really
give
any
credence
to
the
story
my
dear
friend
i
always
make
it
a
rule
to
take
things
at
their
worst
and
then
i
cannot
be
disappointed
i
am
content
to
reason
upon
this
matter
as
if
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
a
vampyre
were
thoroughly
established
and
then
to
think
upon
what
is
best
to
be
done
about
it
you
are
right
if
it
should
turn
out
then
that
there
is
an
error
in
the
fact
well
and
good--we
are
all
the
better
off
but
if
otherwise
we
are
prepared
and
armed
at
all
points
let
it
be
so
then
it
strikes
me
charles
that
you
will
be
the
coolest
and
the
calmest
among
us
all
on
this
emergency
but
the
hour
now
waxes
late
i
will
get
them
to
prepare
a
chamber
for
you
and
at
least
to-night
after
what
has
occurred
already
i
should
think
we
can
be
under
no
apprehension
probably
not
but
henry
if
you
would
allow
me
to
sleep
in
that
room
where
the
portrait
hangs
of
him
whom
you
suppose
to
be
the
vampyre
i
should
prefer
it
prefer
it
yes
i
am
not
one
who
courts
danger
for
danger's
sake
but
i
would
rather
occupy
that
room
to
see
if
the
vampyre
who
perhaps
has
a
partiality
for
it
will
pay
me
a
visit
as
you
please
charles
you
can
have
the
apartment
it
is
in
the
same
state
as
when
occupied
by
flora
nothing
has
been
i
believe
removed
from
it
you
will
let
me
then
while
i
remain
here
call
it
my
room
assuredly
this
arrangement
was
accordingly
made
to
the
surprise
of
all
the
household
not
one
of
whom
would
indeed
have
slept
or
attempted
to
sleep
there
for
any
amount
of
reward
but
charles
holland
had
his
own
reasons
for
preferring
that
chamber
and
he
was
conducted
to
it
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
by
henry
who
looked
around
it
with
a
shudder
as
he
bade
his
young
friend
good
night
charles
holland's
sad
feelings--the
portrait--the
occurrence
of
the
night
at
the
hall
illustration
charles
holland
wished
to
be
alone
if
ever
any
human
being
had
wished
fervently
to
be
so
his
thoughts
were
most
fearfully
oppressive
the
communication
that
had
been
made
to
him
by
henry
bannerworth
had
about
it
too
many
strange
confirmatory
circumstances
to
enable
him
to
treat
it
in
his
own
mind
with
the
disrespect
that
some
mere
freak
of
a
distracted
and
weak
imagination
would
most
probably
have
received
from
him
he
had
found
flora
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
could
arise
only
from
some
such
terrible
cause
as
had
been
mentioned
by
her
brother
and
then
he
was
from
an
occurrence
which
certainly
never
could
have
entered
into
his
calculations
asked
to
forego
the
bright
dream
of
happiness
which
he
had
held
so
long
and
so
rapturously
to
his
heart
how
truly
he
found
that
the
course
of
true
love
ran
not
smooth
and
yet
how
little
would
any
one
have
suspected
that
from
such
a
cause
as
that
which
now
oppressed
his
mind
any
obstruction
would
arise
flora
might
have
been
fickle
and
false
he
might
have
seen
some
other
fairer
face
which
might
have
enchained
his
fancy
and
woven
for
him
a
new
heart's
chain
death
might
have
stepped
between
him
and
the
realization
of
his
fondest
hopes
loss
of
fortune
might
have
made
the
love
cruel
which
would
have
yoked
to
its
distresses
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
reared
in
the
lap
of
luxury
and
who
was
not
even
by
those
who
loved
her
suffered
to
feel
even
in
later
years
any
of
the
pinching
necessities
of
the
family
all
these
things
were
possible--some
of
them
were
probable
and
yet
none
of
them
had
occurred
she
loved
him
still
and
he
although
he
had
looked
on
many
a
fair
face
and
basked
in
the
sunny
smiles
of
beauty
had
never
for
a
moment
forgotten
her
faith
or
lost
his
devotion
to
his
own
dear
english
girl
fortune
he
had
enough
for
both
death
had
not
even
threatened
to
rob
him
of
the
prize
of
such
a
noble
and
faithful
heart
which
he
had
won
but
a
horrible
superstition
had
arisen
which
seemed
to
place
at
once
an
impassable
abyss
between
them
and
to
say
to
him
in
a
voice
of
thundering
denunciation--
charles
holland
will
you
have
a
vampyre
for
your
bride
the
thought
was
terrific
he
paced
the
gloomy
chamber
to
and
fro
with
rapid
strides
until
the
idea
came
across
his
mind
that
by
so
doing
he
might
not
only
be
proclaiming
to
his
kind
entertainers
how
much
he
was
mentally
distracted
but
he
likewise
might
be
seriously
distracting
them
the
moment
this
occurred
to
him
he
sat
down
and
was
profoundly
still
for
some
time
he
then
glanced
at
the
light
which
had
been
given
to
him
and
he
found
himself
almost
unconsciously
engaged
in
a
mental
calculation
as
to
how
long
it
would
last
him
in
the
night
half
ashamed
then
of
such
terrors
as
such
a
consideration
would
seem
to
indicate
he
was
on
the
point
of
hastily
extinguishing
it
when
he
happened
to
cast
his
eyes
on
the
now
mysterious
and
highly
interesting
portrait
in
the
panel
the
picture
as
a
picture
was
well
done
whether
it
was
a
correct
likeness
or
not
of
the
party
whom
it
represented
it
was
one
of
those
kind
of
portraits
that
seem
so
life-like
that
as
you
look
at
them
they
seem
to
return
your
gaze
fully
and
even
to
follow
you
with
their
eyes
from
place
to
place
by
candle-light
such
an
effect
is
more
likely
to
become
striking
and
remarkable
than
by
daylight
and
now
as
charles
holland
shaded
his
own
eyes
from
the
light
so
as
to
cast
its
full
radiance
upon
the
portrait
he
felt
wonderfully
interested
in
its
life-like
appearance
here
is
true
skill
he
said
such
as
i
have
not
before
seen
how
strangely
this
likeness
of
a
man
whom
i
never
saw
seems
to
gaze
upon
me
unconsciously
too
he
aided
the
effect
which
he
justly
enough
called
life-like
by
a
slight
movement
of
the
candle
such
as
any
one
not
blessed
with
nerves
of
iron
would
be
sure
to
make
and
such
a
movement
made
the
face
look
as
if
it
was
inspired
with
vitality
charles
remained
looking
at
the
portrait
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
he
found
a
kind
of
fascination
in
it
which
prevented
him
from
drawing
his
eyes
away
from
it
it
was
not
fear
which
induced
him
to
continue
gazing
on
it
but
the
circumstance
that
it
was
a
likeness
of
the
man
who
after
death
was
supposed
to
have
borrowed
so
new
and
so
hideous
an
existence
combined
with
its
artistic
merits
chained
him
to
the
spot
i
shall
now
he
said
know
that
face
again
let
me
see
it
where
i
may
or
under
what
circumstances
i
may
each
feature
is
now
indelibly
fixed
upon
my
memory--i
never
can
mistake
it
he
turned
aside
as
he
uttered
these
words
and
as
he
did
so
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
part
of
the
ornamental
frame
which
composed
the
edge
of
the
panel
and
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
of
a
different
colour
from
the
surrounding
portion
curiosity
and
increased
interest
prompted
him
at
once
to
make
a
closer
inquiry
into
the
matter
and
by
a
careful
and
diligent
scrutiny
he
was
almost
induced
to
come
to
the
positive
opinion
that
it
no
very
distant
period
in
time
past
the
portrait
had
been
removed
from
the
place
it
occupied
when
once
this
idea
even
vague
and
indistinct
as
it
was
in
consequence
of
the
slight
grounds
he
formed
it
on
had
got
possession
of
his
mind
he
felt
most
anxious
to
prove
its
verification
or
its
fallacy
he
held
the
candle
in
a
variety
of
situations
so
that
its
light
fell
in
different
ways
on
the
picture
and
the
more
he
examined
it
the
more
he
felt
convinced
that
it
must
have
been
moved
lately
it
would
appear
as
if
in
its
removal
a
piece
of
the
old
oaken
carved
framework
of
the
panel
had
been
accidentally
broken
off
which
caused
the
new
look
of
the
fracture
and
that
this
accident
from
the
nature
of
the
broken
bit
of
framing
could
have
occurred
in
any
other
way
than
from
an
actual
or
attempted
removal
of
the
picture
he
felt
was
extremely
unlikely
he
set
down
the
candle
on
a
chair
near
at
hand
and
tried
if
the
panel
was
fast
in
its
place
upon
the
very
first
touch
he
felt
convinced
it
was
not
so
and
that
it
easily
moved
how
to
get
it
out
though
presented
a
difficulty
and
to
get
it
out
was
tempting
who
knows
he
said
to
himself
what
may
be
behind
it
this
is
an
old
baronial
sort
of
hall
and
the
greater
portion
of
it
was
no
doubt
built
at
a
time
when
the
construction
of
such
places
as
hidden
chambers
and
intricate
staircases
were
in
all
buildings
of
importance
considered
a
disiderata
that
he
should
make
some
discovery
behind
the
portrait
now
became
an
idea
that
possessed
him
strongly
although
he
certainly
had
no
definite
grounds
for
really
supposing
that
he
should
do
so
perhaps
the
wish
was
more
father
to
the
thought
than
he
in
the
partial
state
of
excitement
he
was
in
really
imagined
but
so
it
was
he
felt
convinced
that
he
should
not
be
satisfied
until
he
had
removed
that
panel
from
the
wall
and
seen
what
was
immediately
behind
it
after
the
panel
containing
the
picture
had
been
placed
where
it
was
it
appeared
that
pieces
of
moulding
had
been
inserted
all
around
which
had
had
the
effect
of
keeping
it
in
its
place
and
it
was
a
fracture
of
one
of
these
pieces
which
had
first
called
charles
holland's
attention
to
the
probability
of
the
picture
having
been
removed
that
he
should
have
to
get
two
at
least
of
the
pieces
of
moulding
away
before
he
could
hope
to
remove
the
picture
was
to
him
quite
apparent
and
he
was
considering
how
he
should
accomplish
such
a
result
when
he
was
suddenly
startled
by
a
knock
at
his
chamber
door
until
that
sudden
demand
for
admission
at
his
door
came
he
scarcely
knew
to
what
a
nervous
state
he
had
worked
himself
up
it
was
an
odd
sort
of
tap--one
only--a
single
tap
as
if
some
one
demanded
admittance
and
wished
to
awaken
his
attention
with
the
least
possible
chance
of
disturbing
any
one
else
come
in
said
charles
for
he
knew
he
had
not
fastened
his
door
come
in
there
was
no
reply
but
after
a
moment's
pause
the
same
sort
of
low
tap
came
again
again
he
cried
come
in
but
whoever
it
was
seemed
determined
that
the
door
should
be
opened
for
him
and
no
movement
was
made
from
the
outside
a
third
time
the
tap
came
and
charles
was
very
close
to
the
door
when
he
heard
it
for
with
a
noiseless
step
he
had
approached
it
intending
to
open
it
the
instant
this
third
mysterious
demand
for
admission
came
he
did
open
it
wide
there
was
no
one
there
in
an
instant
he
crossed
the
threshold
into
the
corridor
which
ran
right
and
left
a
window
at
one
end
of
it
now
sent
in
the
moon's
rays
so
that
it
was
tolerably
light
but
he
could
see
no
one
indeed
to
look
for
any
one
he
felt
sure
was
needless
for
he
had
opened
his
chamber-door
almost
simultaneously
with
the
last
knock
for
admission
it
is
strange
he
said
as
he
lingered
on
the
threshold
of
his
room
door
for
some
moments
my
imagination
could
not
so
completely
deceive
me
there
was
most
certainly
a
demand
for
admission
slowly
then
he
returned
to
his
room
again
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
one
thing
is
evident
he
said
that
if
i
am
in
this
apartment
to
be
subjected
to
these
annoyances
i
shall
get
no
rest
which
will
soon
exhaust
me
this
thought
was
a
very
provoking
one
and
the
more
he
thought
that
he
should
ultimately
find
a
necessity
for
giving
up
that
chamber
he
had
himself
asked
as
a
special
favour
to
be
allowed
to
occupy
the
more
vexed
he
became
to
think
what
construction
might
be
put
upon
his
conduct
for
so
doing
they
will
all
fancy
me
a
coward
he
thought
and
that
i
dare
not
sleep
here
they
may
not
of
course
say
so
but
they
will
think
that
my
appearing
so
bold
was
one
of
those
acts
of
bravado
which
i
have
not
courage
to
carry
fairly
out
taking
this
view
of
the
matter
was
just
the
way
to
enlist
a
young
man's
pride
in
staying
under
all
circumstances
where
he
was
and
with
a
slight
accession
of
colour
which
even
although
he
was
alone
would
visit
his
cheeks
charles
holland
said
aloud--
i
will
remain
the
occupant
of
this
room
come
what
may
happen
what
may
no
terrors
real
or
unsubstantial
shall
drive
me
from
it
i
will
brave
them
all
and
remain
here
to
brave
them
tap
came
the
knock
at
the
door
again
and
now
with
more
an
air
of
vexation
than
fear
charles
turned
again
towards
it
and
listened
tap
in
another
minute
again
succeeded
and
much
annoyed
he
walked
close
to
the
door
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
lock
ready
to
open
it
at
the
precise
moment
of
another
demand
for
admission
being
made
he
had
not
to
wait
long
in
about
half
a
minute
it
came
again
and
simultaneously
with
the
sound
the
door
flew
open
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
but
as
he
opened
the
door
he
heard
a
strange
sound
in
the
corridor--a
sound
which
scarcely
could
be
called
a
groan
and
scarcely
a
sigh
but
seemed
a
compound
of
both
having
the
agony
of
the
one
combined
with
the
sadness
of
the
other
from
what
direction
it
came
he
could
not
at
the
moment
decide
but
he
called
out--
who's
there
who's
there
the
echo
of
his
own
voice
alone
answered
him
for
a
few
moments
and
then
he
heard
a
door
open
and
a
voice
which
he
knew
to
be
henry's
cried--
what
is
it
who
speaks
henry
said
charles
yes--yes--yes
i
fear
i
have
disturbed
you
you
have
been
disturbed
yourself
or
you
would
not
have
done
so
i
shall
be
with
you
in
a
moment
henry
closed
his
door
before
charles
holland
could
tell
him
not
to
come
to
him
as
he
intended
to
do
for
he
felt
ashamed
to
have
in
a
manner
of
speaking
summoned
assistance
for
so
trifling
a
cause
of
alarm
as
that
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
however
he
could
not
go
to
henry's
chamber
to
forbid
him
from
coming
to
his
and
more
vexed
than
before
he
retired
to
his
room
again
to
await
his
coming
he
left
the
door
open
now
so
that
henry
bannerworth
when
he
had
got
on
some
articles
of
dress
walked
in
at
once
saying--
what
has
happened
charles
a
mere
trifle
henry
concerning
which
i
am
ashamed
you
should
have
been
at
all
disturbed
never
mind
that
i
was
wakeful
i
heard
a
door
open
which
kept
me
listening
but
i
could
not
decide
which
door
it
was
till
i
heard
your
voice
in
the
corridor
well
it
was
this
door
and
i
opened
it
twice
in
consequence
of
the
repeated
taps
for
admission
that
came
to
it
some
one
has
been
knocking
at
it
and
when
i
go
to
it
lo
i
can
see
nobody
indeed
illustration
such
is
the
case
you
surprise
me
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
disturbed
you
because
upon
such
a
ground
i
do
not
feel
that
i
ought
to
have
done
so
and
when
i
called
out
in
the
corridor
i
assure
you
it
was
with
no
such
intention
do
not
regret
it
for
a
moment
said
henry
you
were
quite
justified
in
making
an
alarm
on
such
an
occasion
it's
strange
enough
but
still
it
may
arise
from
some
accidental
cause
admitting
if
we
did
but
know
it
of
some
ready
enough
explanation
it
may
certainly
but
after
what
has
happened
already
we
may
well
suppose
a
mysterious
connexion
between
any
unusual
sight
or
sound
and
the
fearful
ones
we
have
already
seen
certainly
we
may
how
earnestly
that
strange
portrait
seems
to
look
upon
us
charles
it
does
and
i
have
been
examining
it
carefully
it
seems
to
have
been
removed
lately
removed
yes
i
think
as
far
as
i
can
judge
that
it
has
been
taken
from
its
frame
i
mean
that
the
panel
on
which
it
is
painted
has
been
taken
out
indeed
if
you
touch
it
you
will
find
it
loose
and
upon
a
close
examination
you
will
perceive
that
a
piece
of
the
moulding
which
holds
it
in
its
place
has
been
chipped
off
which
is
done
in
such
a
place
that
i
think
it
could
only
have
arisen
during
the
removal
of
the
picture
you
must
be
mistaken
i
cannot
of
course
take
upon
myself
henry
to
say
precisely
such
is
the
case
said
charles
but
there
is
no
one
here
to
do
so
that
i
cannot
say
will
you
permit
me
and
assist
me
to
remove
it
i
have
a
great
curiosity
to
know
what
is
behind
it
if
you
have
i
certainly
will
do
so
we
thought
of
taking
it
away
altogether
but
when
flora
left
this
room
the
idea
was
given
up
as
useless
remain
here
a
few
moments
and
i
will
endeavour
to
find
something
which
shall
assist
us
in
its
removal
henry
left
the
mysterious
chamber
in
order
to
search
in
his
own
for
some
means
of
removing
the
frame-work
of
the
picture
so
that
the
panel
would
slip
easily
out
and
while
he
was
gone
charles
holland
continued
gazing
upon
it
with
greater
interest
if
possible
than
before
in
a
few
minutes
henry
returned
and
although
what
he
had
succeeded
in
finding
were
very
inefficient
implements
for
the
purpose
yet
with
this
aid
the
two
young
men
set
about
the
task
it
is
said
and
said
truly
enough
that
where
there
is
a
will
there
is
a
way
and
although
the
young
men
had
no
tools
at
all
adapted
for
the
purpose
they
did
succeed
in
removing
the
moulding
from
the
sides
of
the
panel
and
then
by
a
little
tapping
at
one
end
of
it
and
using
a
knife
at
a
lever
at
the
other
end
of
the
panel
they
got
it
fairly
out
disappointment
was
all
they
got
for
their
pains
on
the
other
side
there
was
nothing
but
a
rough
wooden
wall
against
which
the
finer
and
more
nicely
finished
oak
panelling
of
the
chamber
rested
there
is
no
mystery
here
said
henry
none
whatever
said
charles
as
he
tapped
the
wall
with
his
knuckles
and
found
it
all
hard
and
sound
we
are
foiled
we
are
indeed
i
had
a
strange
presentiment
now
added
charles
that
we
should
make
some
discovery
that
would
repay
us
for
our
trouble
it
appears
however
that
such
is
not
to
be
the
case
for
you
see
nothing
presents
itself
to
us
but
the
most
ordinary
appearances
i
perceive
as
much
and
the
panel
itself
although
of
more
than
ordinary
thickness
is
after
all
but
a
bit
of
planed
oak
and
apparently
fashioned
for
no
other
object
than
to
paint
the
portrait
on
true
shall
we
replace
it
charles
reluctantly
assented
and
the
picture
was
replaced
in
its
original
position
we
say
charles
reluctantly
assented
because
although
he
had
now
had
ocular
demonstration
that
there
was
really
nothing
behind
the
panel
but
the
ordinary
woodwork
which
might
have
been
expected
from
the
construction
of
the
old
house
yet
he
could
not
even
with
such
a
fact
staring
him
in
the
face
get
rid
entirely
of
the
feeling
that
had
come
across
him
to
the
effect
that
the
picture
had
some
mystery
or
another
you
are
not
yet
satisfied
said
henry
as
he
observed
the
doubtful
look
of
charles
holland's
face
my
dear
friend
said
charles
i
will
not
deceive
you
i
am
much
disappointed
that
we
have
made
no
discovery
behind
that
picture
heaven
knows
we
have
mysteries
enough
in
our
family
said
henry
even
as
he
spoke
they
were
both
startled
by
a
strange
clattering
noise
at
the
window
which
was
accompanied
by
a
shrill
odd
kind
of
shriek
which
sounded
fearful
and
preternatural
on
the
night
air
what
is
that
said
charles
god
only
knows
said
henry
the
two
young
men
naturally
turned
their
earnest
gaze
in
the
direction
of
the
window
which
we
have
before
remarked
was
one
unprovided
with
shutters
and
there
to
their
intense
surprise
they
saw
slowly
rising
up
from
the
lower
part
of
it
what
appeared
to
be
a
human
form
henry
would
have
dashed
forward
but
charles
restrained
him
and
drawing
quickly
from
its
case
a
large
holster
pistol
he
levelled
it
carefully
at
the
figure
saying
in
a
whisper--
henry
if
i
don't
hit
it
i
will
consent
to
forfeit
my
head
he
pulled
the
trigger--a
loud
report
followed--the
room
was
filled
with
smoke
and
then
all
was
still
a
circumstance
however
had
occurred
as
a
consequence
of
the
concussion
of
air
produced
by
the
discharge
of
the
pistol
which
neither
of
the
young
men
had
for
the
moment
calculated
upon
and
that
was
the
putting
out
of
the
only
light
they
there
had
in
spite
of
this
circumstance
charles
the
moment
he
had
discharged
the
pistol
dropped
it
and
sprung
forward
to
the
window
but
here
he
was
perplexed
for
he
could
not
find
the
old
fashioned
intricate
fastening
which
held
it
shut
and
he
had
to
call
to
henry--
henry
for
god's
sake
open
the
window
for
me
henry
the
fastening
of
the
window
is
known
to
you
but
not
to
me
open
it
for
me
thus
called
upon
henry
sprung
forward
and
by
this
time
the
report
of
the
pistol
had
effectually
alarmed
the
whole
household
the
flashing
of
lights
from
the
corridor
came
into
the
room
and
in
another
minute
just
as
henry
succeeded
in
getting
the
window
wide
open
and
charles
holland
had
made
his
way
on
to
the
balcony
both
george
bannerworth
and
mr
marchdale
entered
the
chamber
eager
to
know
what
had
occurred
to
their
eager
questions
henry
replied--
ask
me
not
now
and
then
calling
to
charles
he
said--remain
where
you
are
charles
while
i
run
down
to
the
garden
immediately
beneath
the
balcony
yes--yes
said
charles
henry
made
prodigious
haste
and
was
in
the
garden
immediately
below
the
bay
window
in
a
wonderfully
short
space
of
time
he
spoke
to
charles
saying--
will
you
now
descend
i
can
see
nothing
here
but
we
will
both
make
a
search
george
and
mr
marchdale
were
both
now
in
the
balcony
and
they
would
have
descended
likewise
but
henry
said--
do
not
all
leave
the
house
god
only
knows
now
situated
as
we
are
what
might
happen
i
will
remain
then
said
george
i
have
been
sitting
up
to-night
as
the
guard
and
therefore
may
as
well
continue
to
do
so
marchdale
and
charles
holland
clambered
over
the
balcony
and
easily
from
its
insignificant
height
dropped
into
the
garden
the
night
was
beautiful
and
profoundly
still
there
was
not
a
breath
of
air
sufficient
to
stir
a
leaf
on
a
tree
and
the
very
flame
of
the
candle
which
charles
had
left
burning
in
the
balcony
burnt
clearly
and
steadily
being
perfectly
unruffled
by
any
wind
it
cast
a
sufficient
light
close
to
the
window
to
make
everything
very
plainly
visible
and
it
was
evident
at
a
glance
that
no
object
was
there
although
had
that
figure
which
charles
shot
at
and
no
doubt
hit
been
flesh
and
blood
it
must
have
dropped
immediately
below
as
they
looked
up
for
a
moment
after
a
cursory
examination
of
the
ground
charles
exclaimed--
look
at
the
window
as
the
light
is
now
situated
you
can
see
the
hole
made
in
one
of
the
panes
of
glass
by
the
passage
of
the
bullet
from
my
pistol
they
did
look
and
there
the
clear
round
hole
without
any
starring
which
a
bullet
discharged
close
to
a
pane
of
glass
will
make
in
it
was
clearly
and
plainly
discernible
you
must
have
hit
him
said
henry
one
would
think
so
said
charles
for
that
was
the
exact
place
where
the
figure
was
and
there
is
nothing
here
added
marchdale
what
can
we
think
of
these
events--what
resource
has
the
mind
against
the
most
dreadful
suppositions
concerning
them
charles
and
henry
were
both
silent
in
truth
they
knew
not
what
to
think
and
the
words
uttered
by
marchdale
were
too
strikingly
true
to
dispute
for
a
moment
they
were
lost
in
wonder
human
means
against
such
an
appearance
as
we
saw
to-night
said
charles
are
evidently
useless
my
dear
young
friend
said
marchdale
with
much
emotion
as
he
grasped
henry
bannerworth's
hand
and
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
as
he
did
so--my
dear
young
friend
these
constant
alarms
will
kill
you
they
will
drive
you
and
all
whose
happiness
you
hold
dear
distracted
you
must
control
these
dreadful
feelings
and
there
is
but
one
chance
that
i
can
see
of
getting
now
the
better
of
these
what
is
that
by
leaving
this
place
for
ever
alas
am
i
to
be
driven
from
the
home
of
my
ancestors
from
such
a
cause
as
this
and
whither
am
i
to
fly
where
are
we
to
find
a
refuge
to
leave
here
will
be
at
once
to
break
up
the
establishment
which
is
now
held
together
certainly
upon
the
sufferance
of
creditors
but
still
to
their
advantage
inasmuch
as
i
am
doing
what
no
one
else
would
do
namely
paying
away
to
within
the
scantiest
pittance
the
whole
proceeds
of
the
estate
that
spreads
around
me
heed
nothing
but
an
escape
from
such
horrors
as
seem
to
be
accumulating
now
around
you
if
i
were
sure
that
such
a
removal
would
bring
with
it
such
a
corresponding
advantage
i
might
indeed
be
induced
to
risk
all
to
accomplish
it
as
regards
poor
dear
flora
said
mr
marchdale
i
know
not
what
to
say
or
what
to
think
she
has
been
attacked
by
a
vampyre
and
after
this
mortal
life
shall
have
ended
it
is
dreadful
to
think
there
may
be
a
possibility
that
she
with
all
her
beauty
all
her
excellence
and
purity
of
mind
and
all
those
virtues
and
qualities
which
should
make
her
the
beloved
of
all
and
which
do
indeed
attach
all
hearts
towards
her
should
become
one
of
that
dreadful
tribe
of
beings
who
cling
to
existence
by
feeding
in
the
most
dreadful
manner
upon
the
life
blood
of
others--oh
it
is
too
dreadful
to
contemplate
too
horrible--too
horrible
then
wherefore
speak
of
it
said
charles
with
some
asperity
now
by
the
great
god
of
heaven
who
sees
all
our
hearts
i
will
not
give
in
to
such
a
horrible
doctrine
i
will
not
believe
it
and
were
death
itself
my
portion
for
my
want
of
faith
i
would
this
moment
die
in
my
disbelief
of
anything
so
truly
fearful
oh
my
young
friend
added
marchdale
if
anything
could
add
to
the
pangs
which
all
who
love
and
admire
and
respect
flora
bannerworth
must
feel
at
the
unhappy
condition
in
which
she
is
placed
it
would
be
the
noble
nature
of
you
who
under
happier
auspices
would
have
been
her
guide
through
life
and
the
happy
partner
of
her
destiny
as
i
will
be
still
may
heaven
forbid
it
we
are
now
among
ourselves
and
can
talk
freely
upon
such
a
subject
mr
charles
holland
if
you
wed
you
would
look
forward
to
being
blessed
with
children--those
sweet
ties
which
bind
the
sternest
hearts
to
life
with
so
exquisite
a
bondage
oh
fancy
then
for
a
moment
the
mother
of
your
babes
coming
at
the
still
hour
of
midnight
to
drain
from
their
veins
the
very
life
blood
she
gave
to
them
to
drive
you
and
them
mad
with
the
expected
horror
of
such
visitations--to
make
your
nights
hideous--your
days
but
so
many
hours
of
melancholy
retrospection
oh
you
know
not
the
world
of
terror
on
the
awful
brink
of
which
you
stand
when
you
talk
of
making
flora
bannerworth
a
wife
peace
oh
peace
said
henry
nay
i
know
my
words
are
unwelcome
continued
mr
marchdale
it
happens
unfortunately
for
human
nature
that
truth
and
some
of
our
best
and
holiest
feelings
are
too
often
at
variance
and
hold
a
sad
contest--
i
will
hear
no
more
of
this
cried
charles
holland--i
will
hear
no
more
i
have
done
said
mr
marchdale
and
'twere
well
you
had
not
begun
nay
say
not
so
i
have
but
done
what
i
considered
was
a
solemn
duty
under
that
assumption
of
doing
duty--a
solemn
duty--heedless
of
the
feelings
and
the
opinions
of
others
said
charles
sarcastically
more
mischief
is
produced--more
heart-burnings
and
anxieties
caused
than
by
any
other
two
causes
of
such
mischievous
results
combined
i
wish
to
hear
no
more
of
this
do
not
be
angered
with
mr
marchdale
charles
said
henry
he
can
have
no
motive
but
our
welfare
in
what
he
says
we
should
not
condemn
a
speaker
because
his
words
may
not
sound
pleasant
to
our
ears
by
heaven
said
charles
with
animation
i
meant
not
to
be
illiberal
but
i
will
not
because
i
cannot
see
a
man's
motives
for
active
interference
in
the
affairs
of
others
always
be
ready
merely
on
account
of
such
ignorance
to
jump
to
a
conclusion
that
they
must
be
estimable
to-morrow
i
leave
this
house
said
marchdale
leave
us
exclaimed
henry
ay
for
ever
nay
now
mr
marchdale
is
this
generous
am
i
treated
generously
by
one
who
is
your
own
guest
and
towards
whom
i
was
willing
to
hold
out
the
honest
right
hand
of
friendship
henry
turned
to
charles
holland
saying--
charles
i
know
your
generous
nature
say
you
meant
no
offence
to
my
mother's
old
friend
if
to
say
i
meant
no
offence
said
charles
is
to
say
i
meant
no
insult
i
say
it
freely
enough
cried
marchdale
i
am
satisfied
but
do
not
added
charles
draw
me
any
more
such
pictures
as
the
one
you
have
already
presented
to
my
imagination
i
beg
of
you
from
the
storehouse
of
my
own
fancy
i
can
find
quite
enough
to
make
me
wretched
if
i
choose
to
be
so
but
again
and
again
do
i
say
i
will
not
allow
this
monstrous
superstition
to
tread
me
down
like
the
tread
of
a
giant
on
a
broken
reed
i
will
contend
against
it
while
i
have
life
to
do
so
bravely
spoken
and
when
i
desert
flora
bannerworth
may
heaven
from
that
moment
desert
me
charles
cried
henry
with
emotion
dear
charles
my
more
than
friend--brother
of
my
heart--noble
charles
nay
henry
i
am
not
entitled
to
your
praises
i
were
base
indeed
to
be
other
than
that
which
i
purpose
to
be
come
weal
or
woe--come
what
may
i
am
the
affianced
husband
of
your
sister
and
she
and
she
only
can
break
asunder
the
tie
that
binds
me
to
her
the
offer
for
the
hall--the
visit
to
sir
francis
varney--the
strange
resemblance--a
dreadful
suggestion
illustration
the
party
made
a
strict
search
through
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
garden
but
it
proved
to
be
a
fruitless
one
not
the
least
trace
of
any
one
could
be
found
there
was
only
one
circumstance
which
was
pondered
over
deeply
by
them
all
and
that
was
that
beneath
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
flora
and
her
mother
sat
while
the
brothers
were
on
their
visit
to
the
vault
of
their
ancestors
were
visible
marks
of
blood
to
a
considerable
extent
it
will
be
remembered
that
flora
had
fired
a
pistol
at
the
spectral
appearance
and
that
immediately
upon
that
it
had
disappeared
after
uttering
a
sound
which
might
well
be
construed
into
a
cry
of
pain
from
a
wound
that
a
wound
then
had
been
inflicted
upon
some
one
the
blood
beneath
the
window
now
abundantly
testified
and
when
it
was
discovered
henry
and
charles
made
a
very
close
examination
indeed
of
the
garden
to
discover
what
direction
the
wounded
figure
be
it
man
or
vampyre
had
taken
illustration
but
the
closest
scrutiny
did
not
reveal
to
them
a
single
spot
of
blood
beyond
the
space
immediately
beneath
the
window--there
the
apparition
seemed
to
have
received
its
wound
and
then
by
some
mysterious
means
to
have
disappeared
at
length
wearied
with
the
continued
excitement
combined
with
want
of
sleep
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
they
returned
to
the
hall
flora
with
the
exception
of
the
alarm
she
experienced
from
the
firing
of
the
pistol
had
met
with
no
disturbance
and
that
in
order
to
spare
her
painful
reflections
they
told
her
was
merely
done
as
a
precautionary
measure
to
proclaim
to
any
one
who
might
be
lurking
in
the
garden
that
the
inmates
of
the
house
were
ready
to
defend
themselves
against
any
aggression
whether
or
not
she
believed
this
kind
deceit
they
knew
not
she
only
sighed
deeply
and
wept
the
probability
is
that
she
more
than
suspected
the
vampyre
had
made
another
visit
but
they
forbore
to
press
the
point
and
leaving
her
with
her
mother
henry
and
george
went
from
her
chamber
again--the
former
to
endeavour
to
seek
some
repose
as
it
would
be
his
turn
to
watch
on
the
succeeding
night
and
the
latter
to
resume
his
station
in
a
small
room
close
to
flora's
chamber
where
it
had
been
agreed
watch
and
ward
should
be
kept
by
turns
while
the
alarm
lasted
at
length
the
morning
again
dawned
upon
that
unhappy
family
and
to
none
were
its
beams
more
welcome
the
birds
sang
their
pleasant
carols
beneath
the
window
the
sweet
deep-coloured
autumnal
sun
shone
upon
all
objects
with
a
golden
luster
and
to
look
abroad
upon
the
beaming
face
of
nature
no
one
could
for
a
moment
suppose
except
from
sad
experience
that
there
were
such
things
as
gloom
misery
and
crime
upon
the
earth
and
must
i
said
henry
as
he
gazed
from
a
window
of
the
hall
upon
the
undulating
park
the
majestic
trees
the
flowers
the
shrubs
and
the
many
natural
beauties
with
which
the
place
was
full--must
i
be
chased
from
this
spot
the
home
of
my
self
and
of
my
kindred
by
a
phantom--must
i
indeed
seek
refuge
elsewhere
because
my
own
home
has
become
hideous
it
was
indeed
a
cruel
and
a
painful
thought
it
was
one
he
yet
would
not
could
not
be
convinced
was
absolutely
necessary
but
now
the
sun
was
shining
it
was
morning
and
the
feelings
which
found
a
home
in
his
breast
amid
the
darkness
the
stillness
and
the
uncertainty
of
night
were
chased
away
by
those
glorious
beams
of
sunlight
that
fell
upon
hill
valley
and
stream
and
the
thousand
sweet
sounds
of
life
and
animation
that
filled
that
sunny
air
such
a
revulsion
of
feeling
was
natural
enough
many
of
the
distresses
and
mental
anxieties
of
night
vanish
with
the
night
and
those
which
oppressed
the
heart
of
henry
bannerworth
were
considerably
modified
he
was
engaged
in
these
reflections
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
lodge
bell
and
as
a
visitor
was
now
somewhat
rare
at
this
establishment
he
waited
with
some
anxiety
to
see
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
so
early
a
call
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
one
of
the
servants
came
to
him
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
it
bore
a
large
handsome
seal
and
from
its
appearance
would
seem
to
have
come
from
some
personage
of
consequence
a
second
glance
at
it
shewed
him
the
name
of
varney
in
the
corner
and
with
some
degree
of
vexation
he
muttered
to
himself
another
condoling
epistle
from
the
troublesome
neighbour
whom
i
have
not
yet
seen
if
you
please
sir
said
the
servant
who
had
brought
him
the
letter
as
i'm
here
and
you
are
here
perhaps
you'll
have
no
objection
to
give
me
what
i'm
to
have
for
the
day
and
two
nights
as
i've
been
here
cos
i
can't
stay
in
a
family
as
is
so
familiar
with
all
sorts
o'
ghostesses
i
ain't
used
to
such
company
what
do
you
mean
said
henry
the
question
was
a
superfluous
one--
too
well
he
knew
what
the
woman
meant
and
the
conviction
came
across
his
mind
strongly
that
no
domestic
would
consent
to
live
long
in
a
house
which
was
subject
to
such
dreadful
visitations
what
does
i
mean
said
the
woman--why
sir
if
it's
all
the
same
to
you
i
don't
myself
come
of
a
wampyre
family
and
i
don't
choose
to
remain
in
a
house
where
there
is
sich
things
encouraged
that's
what
i
means
sir
what
wages
are
owing
to
you
said
henry
why
as
to
wages
i
only
comed
here
by
the
day
go
then
and
settle
with
my
mother
the
sooner
you
leave
this
house
the
better
oh
indeed
i'm
sure
i
don't
want
to
stay
this
woman
was
one
of
those
who
were
always
armed
at
all
points
for
a
row
and
she
had
no
notion
of
concluding
any
engagement
of
any
character
whatever
without
some
disturbance
therefore
to
see
henry
take
what
she
said
with
such
provoking
calmness
was
aggravating
in
the
extreme
but
there
was
no
help
for
such
a
source
of
vexation
she
could
find
no
other
ground
of
quarrel
than
what
was
connected
with
the
vampyre
and
as
henry
would
not
quarrel
with
her
on
such
a
score
she
was
compelled
to
give
it
up
in
despair
when
henry
found
himself
alone
and
free
from
the
annoyance
of
this
woman
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
letter
he
held
in
his
hand
and
which
from
the
autograph
in
the
corner
he
knew
came
from
his
new
neighbour
sir
francis
varney
whom
by
some
chance
or
another
he
had
never
yet
seen
to
his
great
surprise
he
found
that
the
letter
contained
the
following
words--
dear
sir--as
a
neighbour
by
purchase
of
an
estate
contiguous
to
your
own
i
am
quite
sure
you
have
excused
and
taken
in
good
part
the
cordial
offer
i
made
to
you
of
friendship
and
service
some
short
time
since
but
now
in
addressing
to
you
a
distinct
proposition
i
trust
i
shall
meet
with
an
indulgent
consideration
whether
such
proposition
be
accordant
with
your
views
or
not
what
i
have
heard
from
common
report
induces
me
to
believe
that
bannerworth
hall
cannot
be
a
desirable
residence
for
yourself
or
your
amiable
sister
if
i
am
right
in
that
conjecture
and
you
have
any
serious
thought
of
leaving
the
place
i
would
earnestly
recommend
you
as
one
having
some
experience
in
such
descriptions
of
property
to
sell
it
at
once
now
the
proposition
with
which
i
conclude
this
letter
is
i
know
of
a
character
to
make
you
doubt
the
disinterestedness
of
such
advice
but
that
it
is
disinterested
nevertheless
is
a
fact
of
which
i
can
assure
my
own
heart
and
of
which
i
beg
to
assure
you
i
propose
then
should
you
upon
consideration
decide
upon
such
a
course
of
proceeding
to
purchase
of
you
the
hall
i
do
not
ask
for
a
bargain
on
account
of
any
extraneous
circumstances
which
may
at
the
present
time
depreciate
the
value
of
the
property
but
i
am
willing
to
give
a
fair
price
for
it
under
these
circumstances
i
trust
sir
that
you
will
give
a
kindly
consideration
to
my
offer
and
even
if
you
reject
it
i
hope
that
as
neighbours
we
may
live
long
in
peace
and
amity
and
in
the
interchange
of
those
good
offices
which
should
subsist
between
us
awaiting
your
reply
believe
me
to
be
dear
sir
your
very
obedient
servant
francis
varney
to
henry
bannerworth
esq
henry
after
having
read
this
most
unobjectionable
letter
through
folded
it
up
again
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
clasping
his
hands
then
behind
his
back
a
favourite
attitude
of
his
when
he
was
in
deep
contemplation
he
paced
to
and
fro
in
the
garden
for
some
time
in
deep
thought
how
strange
he
muttered
it
seems
that
every
circumstance
combines
to
induce
me
to
leave
my
old
ancestral
home
it
appears
as
if
everything
now
that
happened
had
that
direct
tendency
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
all
this
'tis
very
strange--amazingly
strange
here
arise
circumstances
which
are
enough
to
induce
any
man
to
leave
a
particular
place
then
a
friend
in
whose
single-mindedness
and
judgment
i
know
i
can
rely
advises
the
step
and
immediately
upon
the
back
of
that
comes
a
fair
and
candid
offer
there
was
an
apparent
connexion
between
all
these
circumstances
which
much
puzzled
henry
he
walked
to
and
fro
for
nearly
an
hour
until
he
heard
a
hasty
footstep
approaching
him
and
upon
looking
in
the
direction
from
whence
it
came
he
saw
mr
marchdale
i
will
seek
marchdale's
advice
he
said
upon
this
matter
i
will
hear
what
he
says
concerning
it
henry
said
marchdale
when
he
came
sufficiently
near
to
him
for
conversation
why
do
you
remain
here
alone
i
have
received
a
communication
from
our
neighbour
sir
francis
varney
said
henry
indeed
it
is
here
peruse
it
for
yourself
and
then
tell
me
marchdale
candidly
what
you
think
of
it
i
suppose
said
marchdale
as
he
opened
the
letter
it
is
another
friendly
note
of
condolence
on
the
state
of
your
domestic
affairs
which
i
grieve
to
say
from
the
prattling
of
domestics
whose
tongues
it
is
quite
impossible
to
silence
have
become
food
for
gossip
all
over
the
neighbouring
villages
and
estates
if
anything
could
add
another
pang
to
those
i
have
already
been
made
to
suffer
said
henry
it
would
certainly
arise
from
being
made
the
food
of
vulgar
gossip
but
read
the
letter
marchdale
you
will
find
its
contents
of
a
more
important
character
than
you
anticipate
indeed
said
marchdale
as
he
ran
his
eyes
eagerly
over
the
note
when
he
had
finished
it
he
glanced
at
henry
who
then
said--
well
what
is
your
opinion
i
know
not
what
to
say
henry
you
know
that
my
own
advice
to
you
has
been
to
get
rid
of
this
place
it
has
with
the
hope
that
the
disagreeable
affair
connected
with
it
now
may
remain
connected
with
it
as
a
house
and
not
with
you
and
yours
as
a
family
it
may
be
so
there
appears
to
me
every
likelihood
of
it
i
do
not
know
said
henry
with
a
shudder
i
must
confess
marchdale
that
to
my
own
perceptions
it
seems
more
probable
that
the
infliction
we
have
experienced
from
the
strange
visitor
who
seems
now
resolved
to
pester
us
with
visits
will
rather
attach
to
a
family
than
to
a
house
the
vampyre
may
follow
us
if
so
of
course
the
parting
with
the
hall
would
be
a
great
pity
and
no
gain
none
in
the
least
henry
a
thought
has
struck
me
let's
hear
it
marchdale
it
is
this--suppose
you
were
to
try
the
experiment
of
leaving
the
hall
without
selling
it
suppose
for
one
year
you
were
to
let
it
to
some
one
henry
it
might
be
done
ay
and
it
might
with
very
great
promise
and
candour
be
proposed
to
this
very
gentleman
sir
francis
varney
to
take
it
for
one
year
to
see
how
he
liked
it
before
becoming
the
possessor
of
it
then
if
he
found
himself
tormented
by
the
vampyre
he
need
not
complete
the
purchase
or
if
you
found
that
the
apparition
followed
you
from
hence
you
might
yourself
return
feeling
that
perhaps
here
in
the
spots
familiar
to
your
youth
you
might
be
most
happy
even
under
such
circumstances
as
at
present
oppress
you
most
happy
ejaculated
henry
perhaps
i
should
not
have
used
that
word
i
am
sure
you
should
not
said
henry
when
you
speak
of
me
well--well
let
us
hope
that
the
time
may
not
be
very
far
distant
when
i
may
use
the
term
happy
as
applied
to
you
in
the
most
conclusive
and
the
strongest
manner
it
can
be
used
oh
said
henry
i
will
hope
but
do
not
mock
me
with
it
now
marchdale
i
pray
you
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
mock
you
well--well
i
do
not
believe
you
are
the
man
to
do
so
to
any
one
but
about
this
affair
of
the
house
distinctly
then
if
i
were
you
i
would
call
upon
sir
francis
varney
and
make
him
an
offer
to
become
a
tenant
of
the
hall
for
twelve
months
during
which
time
you
could
go
where
you
please
and
test
the
fact
of
absence
ridding
you
or
not
ridding
you
of
the
dreadful
visitant
who
makes
the
night
here
truly
hideous
i
will
speak
to
my
mother
to
george
and
to
my
sister
of
the
matter
they
shall
decide
mr
marchdale
now
strove
in
every
possible
manner
to
raise
the
spirits
of
henry
bannerworth
by
painting
to
him
the
future
in
far
more
radiant
colours
than
the
present
and
endeavouring
to
induce
a
belief
in
his
mind
that
a
short
period
of
time
might
after
all
replace
in
his
mind
and
in
the
minds
of
those
who
were
naturally
so
dear
to
him
all
their
wonted
serenity
henry
although
he
felt
not
much
comfort
from
these
kindly
efforts
yet
could
feel
gratitude
to
him
who
made
them
and
after
expressing
such
a
feeling
to
marchdale
in
strong
terms
he
repaired
to
the
house
in
order
to
hold
a
solemn
consultation
with
those
whom
he
felt
ought
to
be
consulted
as
well
as
himself
as
to
what
steps
should
be
taken
with
regard
to
the
hall
the
proposition
or
rather
the
suggestion
which
had
been
made
by
marchdale
upon
the
proposition
of
sir
francis
varney
was
in
every
respect
so
reasonable
and
just
that
it
met
as
was
to
be
expected
with
the
concurrence
of
every
member
of
the
family
flora's
cheeks
almost
resumed
some
of
their
wonted
colour
at
the
mere
thought
now
of
leaving
that
home
to
which
she
had
been
at
one
time
so
much
attached
yes
dear
henry
she
said
let
us
leave
here
if
you
are
agreeable
so
to
do
and
in
leaving
this
house
we
will
believe
that
we
leave
behind
us
a
world
of
terror
flora
remarked
henry
in
a
tone
of
slight
reproach
if
you
were
so
anxious
to
leave
bannerworth
hall
why
did
you
not
say
so
before
this
proposition
came
from
other
mouths
you
know
your
feelings
upon
such
a
subject
would
have
been
laws
to
me
i
knew
you
were
attached
to
the
old
house
said
flora
and
besides
events
have
come
upon
us
all
with
such
fearful
rapidity
there
has
scarcely
been
time
to
think
true--true
and
you
will
leave
henry
i
will
call
upon
sir
francis
varney
myself
and
speak
to
him
upon
the
subject
a
new
impetus
to
existence
appeared
now
to
come
over
the
whole
family
at
the
idea
of
leaving
a
place
which
always
would
be
now
associated
in
their
minds
with
so
much
terror
each
member
of
the
family
felt
happier
and
breathed
more
freely
than
before
so
that
the
change
which
had
come
over
them
seemed
almost
magical
and
charles
holland
too
was
much
better
pleased
and
he
whispered
to
flora--
dear
flora
you
will
now
surely
no
longer
talk
of
driving
from
you
the
honest
heart
that
loves
you
hush
charles
hush
she
said
meet
me
an
hour
hence
in
the
garden
and
we
will
talk
of
this
that
hour
will
seem
an
age
he
said
henry
now
having
made
a
determination
to
see
sir
francis
varney
lost
no
time
in
putting
it
into
execution
at
mr
marchdale's
own
request
he
took
him
with
him
as
it
was
desirable
to
have
a
third
person
present
in
the
sort
of
business
negotiation
which
was
going
on
the
estate
which
had
been
so
recently
entered
upon
by
the
person
calling
himself
sir
francis
varney
and
which
common
report
said
he
had
purchased
was
a
small
but
complete
property
and
situated
so
close
to
the
grounds
connected
with
bannerworth
hall
that
a
short
walk
soon
placed
henry
and
mr
marchdale
before
the
residence
of
this
gentleman
who
had
shown
so
kindly
a
feeling
towards
the
bannerworth
family
have
you
seen
sir
francis
varney
asked
henry
of
mr
marchdale
as
he
rung
the
gate-bell
i
have
not
have
you
no
i
never
saw
him
it
is
rather
awkward
our
both
being
absolute
strangers
to
his
person
we
can
but
send
in
our
names
however
and
from
the
great
vein
of
courtesy
that
runs
through
his
letter
i
have
no
doubt
but
we
shall
receive
the
most
gentlemanly
reception
from
him
a
servant
in
handsome
livery
appeared
at
the
iron-gates
which
opened
upon
a
lawn
in
the
front
of
sir
francis
varney's
house
and
to
this
domestic
henry
bannerworth
handed
his
card
on
which
he
had
written
in
pencil
likewise
the
name
of
mr
marchdale
if
your
master
he
said
is
within
we
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
sir
francis
is
at
home
sir
was
the
reply
although
not
very
well
if
you
will
be
pleased
to
walk
in
i
will
announce
you
to
him
henry
and
marchdale
followed
the
man
into
a
handsome
enough
reception-room
where
they
were
desired
to
wait
while
their
names
were
announced
do
you
know
if
this
gentleman
be
a
baronet
said
henry
or
a
knight
merely
i
really
do
not
i
never
saw
him
in
my
life
or
heard
of
him
before
he
came
into
this
neighbourhood
and
i
have
been
too
much
occupied
with
the
painful
occurrences
of
this
hall
to
know
anything
of
our
neighbours
i
dare
say
mr
chillingworth
if
we
had
thought
to
ask
him
would
have
known
something
concerning
him
no
doubt
this
brief
colloquy
was
put
an
end
to
by
the
servant
who
said--
my
master
gentlemen
is
not
very
well
but
he
begs
me
to
present
his
best
compliments
and
to
say
he
is
much
gratified
with
your
visit
and
will
be
happy
to
see
you
in
his
study
henry
and
marchdale
followed
the
man
up
a
flight
of
stone
stairs
and
then
they
were
conducted
through
a
large
apartment
into
a
smaller
one
there
was
very
little
light
in
this
small
room
but
at
the
moment
of
their
entrance
a
tall
man
who
was
seated
rose
and
touching
the
spring
of
a
blind
that
was
to
the
window
it
was
up
in
a
moment
admitting
a
broad
glare
of
light
a
cry
of
surprise
mingled
with
terror
came
from
henry
bannerworth's
lip
the
original
of
the
portrait
on
the
panel
stood
before
him
there
was
the
lofty
stature
the
long
sallow
face
the
slightly
projecting
teeth
the
dark
lustrous
although
somewhat
sombre
eyes
the
expression
of
the
features--all
were
alike
are
you
unwell
sir
said
sir
francis
varney
in
soft
mellow
accents
as
he
handed
a
chair
to
the
bewildered
henry
god
of
heaven
said
henry
how
like
you
seem
surprised
sir
have
you
ever
seen
me
before
sir
francis
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
cast
a
strange
glance
upon
henry
whose
eyes
were
rivetted
upon
his
face
as
if
with
a
species
of
fascination
which
he
could
not
resist
marchdale
henry
gasped
marchdale
my
friend
marchdale
i--i
am
surely
mad
hush
be
calm
whispered
marchdale
calm--calm--can
you
not
see
marchdale
is
this
a
dream
look--look--oh
look
for
god's
sake
henry
compose
yourself
is
your
friend
often
thus
said
sir
francis
varney
with
the
same
mellifluous
tone
which
seemed
habitual
to
him
no
sir
he
is
not
but
recent
circumstances
have
shattered
his
nerves
and
to
tell
the
truth
you
bear
so
strong
a
resemblance
to
an
old
portrait
in
his
house
that
i
do
not
wonder
so
much
as
i
otherwise
should
at
his
agitation
indeed
a
resemblance
said
henry
a
resemblance
god
of
heaven
it
is
the
face
itself
you
much
surprise
me
said
sir
francis
illustration
henry
sunk
into
the
chair
which
was
near
him
and
he
trembled
violently
the
rush
of
painful
thoughts
and
conjectures
that
came
through
his
mind
was
enough
to
make
any
one
tremble
is
this
the
vampyre
was
the
horrible
question
that
seemed
impressed
upon
his
very
brain
in
letters
of
flame
is
this
the
vampyre
are
you
better
sir
said
sir
francis
varney
in
his
bland
musical
voice
shall
i
order
any
refreshment
for
you
no--no
gasped
henry
for
the
love
of
truth
tell
me
is--is
your
name
really
varney
sir
have
you
no
other
name
to
which
perhaps
a
better
title
you
could
urge
mr
bannerworth
i
can
assure
you
that
i
am
too
proud
of
the
name
of
the
family
to
which
i
belong
to
exchange
it
for
any
other
be
it
what
it
may
how
wonderfully
like
i
grieve
to
see
you
so
much
distressed
mr
bannerworth
i
presume
ill
health
has
thus
shattered
your
nerves
no
ill
health
has
not
done
the
work
i
know
not
what
to
say
sir
francis
varney
to
you
but
recent
events
in
my
family
have
made
the
sight
of
you
full
of
horrible
conjectures
what
mean
you
sir
you
know
from
common
report
that
we
have
had
a
fearful
visitor
at
our
house
a
vampyre
i
have
heard
said
sir
francis
varney
with
a
bland
and
almost
beautiful
smile
which
displayed
his
white
glistening
teeth
to
perfection
yes
a
vampyre
and--and--
i
pray
you
go
on
sir
you
surely
are
far
above
the
vulgar
superstition
of
believing
in
such
matters
my
judgment
is
assailed
in
too
many
ways
and
shapes
for
it
to
hold
out
probably
as
it
ought
to
do
against
so
hideous
a
belief
but
never
was
it
so
much
bewildered
as
now
why
so
because--
nay
henry
whispered
mr
marchdale
it
is
scarcely
civil
to
tell
sir
francis
to
his
face
that
he
resembles
a
vampyre
i
must
i
must
pray
sir
interrupted
varney
to
marchdale
permit
mr
bannerworth
to
speak
here
freely
there
is
nothing
in
the
whole
world
i
so
much
admire
as
candour
then
you
so
much
resemble
the
vampyre
added
henry
that--that
i
know
not
what
to
think
is
it
possible
said
varney
it
is
a
damning
fact
well
it's
unfortunate
for
me
i
presume
ah
varney
gave
a
twinge
of
pain
as
if
some
sudden
bodily
ailment
had
attacked
him
severely
you
are
unwell
sir
said
marchdale
no
no--no
he
said
i--hurt
my
arm
and
happened
accidentally
to
touch
the
arm
of
this
chair
with
it
a
hurt
said
henry
yes
mr
bannerworth
a--a
wound
yes
a
wound
but
not
much
more
than
skin
deep
in
fact
little
beyond
an
abrasion
of
the
skin
may
i
inquire
how
you
came
by
it
oh
yes
a
slight
fall
indeed
remarkable
is
it
not
very
remarkable
we
never
know
a
moment
when
from
same
most
trifling
cause
we
may
receive
really
some
serious
bodily
harm
how
true
it
is
mr
bannerworth
that
in
the
midst
of
life
we
are
in
death
and
equally
true
perhaps
said
henry
that
in
the
midst
of
death
there
may
be
found
a
horrible
life
well
i
should
not
wonder
there
are
really
so
many
strange
things
in
this
world
that
i
have
left
off
wondering
at
anything
now
there
are
strange
things
said
henry
you
wish
to
purchase
of
me
the
hall
sir
if
you
wish
to
sell
you--you
are
perhaps
attached
to
the
place
perhaps
you
recollected
it
sir
long
ago
not
very
long
smiled
sir
francis
varney
it
seems
a
nice
comfortable
old
house
and
the
grounds
too
appear
to
be
amazingly
well
wooded
which
to
one
of
rather
a
romantic
temperament
like
myself
is
always
an
additional
charm
to
a
place
i
was
extremely
pleased
with
it
the
first
time
i
beheld
it
and
a
desire
to
call
myself
the
owner
of
it
took
possession
of
my
mind
the
scenery
is
remarkable
for
its
beauty
and
from
what
i
have
seen
of
it
it
is
rarely
to
be
excelled
no
doubt
you
are
greatly
attached
to
it
it
has
been
my
home
from
infancy
returned
henry
and
being
also
the
residence
of
my
ancestors
for
centuries
it
is
natural
that
i
should
be
so
true--true
the
house
no
doubt
has
suffered
much
said
henry
within
the
last
hundred
years
no
doubt
it
has
a
hundred
years
is
a
tolerable
long
space
of
time
you
know
it
is
indeed
oh
how
any
human
life
which
is
spun
out
to
such
an
extent
must
lose
its
charms
by
losing
all
its
fondest
and
dearest
associations
ah
how
true
said
sir
francis
varney
he
had
some
minutes
previously
touched
a
bell
and
at
this
moment
a
servant
brought
in
on
a
tray
some
wine
and
refreshments
henry's
agreement
with
sir
francis
varney--the
sudden
arrival
at
the
hall--flora's
alarm
illustration
on
the
tray
which
the
servant
brought
into
the
room
were
refreshments
of
different
kinds
including
wine
and
after
waving
his
hand
for
the
domestic
to
retire
sir
francis
varney
said--
you
will
be
better
mr
bannerworth
for
a
glass
of
wine
after
your
walk
and
you
too
sir
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
have
quite
forgotten
your
name
marchdale
mr
marchdale
ay
marchdale
pray
sir
help
yourself
you
take
nothing
yourself
said
henry
i
am
under
a
strict
regimen
replied
varney
the
simplest
diet
alone
does
for
me
and
i
have
accustomed
myself
to
long
abstinence
he
will
not
eat
or
drink
muttered
henry
abstractedly
will
you
sell
me
the
hall
said
sir
francis
varney
henry
looked
in
his
face
again
from
which
he
had
only
momentarily
withdrawn
his
eyes
and
he
was
then
more
struck
than
ever
with
the
resemblance
between
him
and
the
portrait
on
the
panel
of
what
had
been
flora's
chamber
what
made
that
resemblance
too
one
about
which
there
could
scarcely
be
two
opinions
was
the
mark
or
cicatrix
of
a
wound
in
the
forehead
which
the
painter
had
slightly
indented
in
the
portrait
but
which
was
much
more
plainly
visible
on
the
forehead
of
sir
francis
varney
now
that
henry
observed
this
distinctive
mark
which
he
had
not
done
before
he
could
feel
no
doubt
and
a
sickening
sensation
came
over
him
at
the
thought
that
he
was
actually
now
in
the
presence
of
one
of
those
terrible
creatures
vampyres
you
do
not
drink
said
varney
most
young
men
are
not
so
modest
with
a
decanter
of
unimpeachable
wine
before
them
i
pray
you
help
yourself
i
cannot
henry
rose
as
he
spoke
and
turning
to
marchdale
he
said
in
addition--
will
you
come
away
if
you
please
said
marchdale
rising
but
you
have
not
my
dear
sir
said
varney
given
me
yet
any
answer
about
the
hall
i
cannot
yet
answered
henry
i
will
think
my
present
impression
is
to
let
you
have
it
on
whatever
terms
you
may
yourself
propose
always
provided
you
consent
to
one
of
mine
name
it
that
you
never
show
yourself
in
my
family
how
very
unkind
i
understand
you
have
a
charming
sister
young
beautiful
and
accomplished
shall
i
confess
now
that
i
had
hopes
of
making
myself
agreeable
to
her
you
make
yourself
agreeable
to
her
the
sight
of
you
would
blast
her
for
ever
and
drive
her
to
madness
am
i
so
hideous
no
but--you
are--
what
am
i
hush
henry
hush
cried
marchdale
remember
you
are
in
this
gentleman's
house
true
true
why
does
he
tempt
me
to
say
these
dreadful
things
i
do
not
want
to
say
them
come
away
then--come
away
at
once
sir
francis
varney
my
friend
mr
bannerworth
will
think
over
your
offer
and
let
you
know
i
think
you
may
consider
that
your
wish
to
become
the
purchaser
of
the
hall
will
be
complied
with
i
wish
to
have
it
said
varney
and
i
can
only
say
that
if
i
am
master
of
it
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
see
any
of
the
family
on
a
visit
at
any
time
a
visit
said
henry
with
a
shudder
a
visit
to
the
tomb
were
far
more
desirable
farewell
sir
adieu
said
sir
francis
varney
and
he
made
one
of
the
most
elegant
bows
in
the
world
while
there
came
over
his
face
a
peculiarity
of
expression
that
was
strange
if
not
painful
to
contemplate
in
another
minute
henry
and
marchdale
were
clear
of
the
house
and
with
feelings
of
bewilderment
and
horror
which
beggar
all
description
poor
henry
allowed
himself
to
be
led
by
the
arm
by
marchdale
to
some
distance
without
uttering
a
word
when
he
did
speak
he
said--
marchdale
it
would
be
charity
of
some
one
to
kill
me
to
kill
you
yes
for
i
am
certain
otherwise
that
i
must
go
mad
nay
nay
rouse
yourself
this
man
varney
is
a
vampyre
hush
hush
i
tell
you
marchdale
cried
henry
in
a
wild
excited
manner
he
is
a
vampyre
he
is
the
dreadful
being
who
visited
flora
at
the
still
hour
of
midnight
and
drained
the
life-blood
from
her
veins
he
is
a
vampyre
there
are
such
things
i
cannot
doubt
now
oh
god
i
wish
now
that
your
lightnings
would
blast
me
as
here
i
stand
for
over
into
annihilation
for
i
am
going
mad
to
be
compelled
to
feel
that
such
horrors
can
really
have
existence
henry--henry
nay
talk
not
to
me
what
can
i
do
shall
i
kill
him
is
it
not
a
sacred
duty
to
destroy
such
a
thing
oh
horror--horror
he
must
be
killed--destroyed--burnt
and
the
very
dust
to
which
he
is
consumed
must
be
scattered
to
the
winds
of
heaven
it
would
be
a
deed
well
done
marchdale
hush
hush
these
words
are
dangerous
i
care
not
what
if
they
were
overheard
now
by
unfriendly
ears
what
might
not
be
the
uncomfortable
results
i
pray
you
be
more
cautious
what
you
say
of
this
strange
man
i
must
destroy
him
and
wherefore
can
you
ask
is
he
not
a
vampyre
yes
but
reflect
henry
for
a
moment
upon
the
length
to
which
you
might
carry
out
so
dangerous
an
argument
it
is
said
that
vampyres
are
made
by
vampyres
sucking
the
blood
of
those
who
but
for
that
circumstance
would
have
died
and
gone
to
decay
in
the
tomb
along
with
ordinary
mortals
but
that
being
so
attacked
during
life
by
a
vampyre
they
themselves
after
death
become
such
well--well
what
is
that
to
me
have
you
forgotten
flora
a
cry
of
despair
came
from
poor
henry's
lips
and
in
a
moment
he
seemed
completely
mentally
and
physically
prostrated
god
of
heaven
he
moaned
i
had
forgotten
her
i
thought
you
had
oh
if
the
sacrifice
of
my
own
life
would
suffice
to
put
an
end
to
all
this
accumulating
horror
how
gladly
would
i
lay
it
down
ay
in
any
way--in
any
way
no
mode
of
death
should
appal
me
no
amount
of
pain
make
me
shrink
i
could
smile
then
upon
the
destroyer
and
say
'welcome--welcome--most
welcome'
rather
henry
seek
to
live
for
those
whom
you
love
than
die
for
them
your
death
would
leave
them
desolate
in
life
you
may
ward
off
many
a
blow
of
fate
from
them
i
may
endeavour
so
to
do
consider
that
flora
may
be
wholly
dependent
upon
such
kindness
as
you
may
be
able
to
bestow
upon
her
charles
clings
to
her
humph
you
do
not
doubt
him
my
dear
friend
henry
bannerworth
although
i
am
not
an
old
man
yet
i
am
so
much
older
than
you
that
i
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
and
am
perhaps
far
better
able
to
come
to
accurate
judgments
with
regard
to
individuals
no
doubt--no
doubt
but
yet--
nay
hear
me
out
such
judgments
founded
upon
experience
when
uttered
have
all
the
character
of
prophecy
about
them
i
therefore
now
prophecy
to
you
that
charles
holland
will
yet
be
so
stung
with
horror
at
the
circumstance
of
a
vampyre
visiting
flora
that
he
will
never
make
her
his
wife
marchdale
i
differ
from
you
most
completely
said
henry
i
know
that
charles
holland
is
the
very
soul
of
honour
i
cannot
argue
the
matter
with
you
it
has
not
become
a
thing
of
fact
i
have
only
sincerely
to
hope
that
i
am
wrong
you
are
you
may
depend
entirely
wrong
i
cannot
be
deceived
in
charles
from
you
such
words
produce
no
effect
but
one
of
regret
that
you
should
so
much
err
in
your
estimate
of
any
one
from
any
one
but
yourself
they
would
have
produced
in
me
a
feeling
of
anger
i
might
have
found
it
difficult
to
smother
it
has
often
been
my
misfortune
through
life
said
mr
marchdale
sadly
to
give
the
greatest
offence
where
i
feel
the
truest
friendship
because
it
is
in
such
quarters
that
i
am
always
tempted
to
speak
too
freely
nay
no
offence
said
henry
i
am
distracted
and
scarcely
know
what
i
say
marchdale
i
know
you
are
my
sincere
friend--but
as
i
tell
you
i
am
nearly
mad
my
dear
henry
be
calmer
consider
upon
what
is
to
be
said
concerning
this
interview
at
home
ay
that
is
a
consideration
i
should
not
think
it
advisable
to
mention
the
disagreeable
fact
that
in
your
neighbour
you
think
you
have
found
out
the
nocturnal
disturber
of
your
family
no--no
i
would
say
nothing
of
it
it
is
not
at
all
probable
that
after
what
you
have
said
to
him
this
sir
francis
varney
or
whatever
his
real
name
may
be
will
obtrude
himself
upon
you
if
he
should
he
die
he
will
perhaps
consider
that
such
a
step
would
be
dangerous
to
him
it
would
be
fatal
so
help
me
however
and
then
would
i
take
especial
care
that
no
power
of
resuscitation
should
ever
enable
that
man
again
to
walk
the
earth
they
say
that
only
way
of
destroying
a
vampyre
is
to
fix
him
to
the
earth
with
a
stake
so
that
he
cannot
move
and
then
of
course
decomposition
will
take
its
course
as
in
ordinary
cases
fire
would
consume
him
and
be
a
quicker
process
said
henry
but
these
are
fearful
reflections
and
for
the
present
we
will
not
pursue
them
now
to
play
the
hypocrite
and
endeavour
to
look
composed
and
serene
to
my
mother
and
to
flora
while
my
heart
is
breaking
the
two
friends
had
by
this
time
reached
the
hall
and
leaving
his
friend
marchdale
henry
bannerworth
with
feelings
of
the
most
unenviable
description
slowly
made
his
way
to
the
apartment
occupied
by
his
mother
and
sister
illustration
the
old
admiral
and
his
servant--the
communication
from
the
landlord
of
the
nelson's
arms
illustration
while
those
matters
of
most
grave
and
serious
import
were
going
on
at
the
hall
while
each
day
and
almost
each
hour
in
each
day
was
producing
more
and
more
conclusive
evidence
upon
a
matter
which
at
first
had
seemed
too
monstrous
to
be
at
all
credited
it
may
well
be
supposed
what
a
wonderful
sensation
was
produced
among
the
gossip-mongers
of
the
neighbourhood
by
the
exaggerated
reports
that
had
reached
them
the
servants
who
had
left
the
hall
on
no
other
account
as
they
declared
but
sheer
fright
at
the
awful
visits
of
the
vampyre
spread
the
news
far
and
wide
so
that
in
the
adjoining
villages
and
market-towns
the
vampyre
of
bannerworth
hall
became
quite
a
staple
article
of
conversation
such
a
positive
godsend
for
the
lovers
of
the
marvellous
had
not
appeared
in
the
country
side
within
the
memory
of
that
sapient
individual--the
oldest
inhabitant
and
moreover
there
was
one
thing
which
staggered
some
people
of
better
education
and
maturer
judgments
and
that
was
that
the
more
they
took
pains
to
inquire
into
the
matter
in
order
if
possible
to
put
an
end
to
what
they
considered
a
gross
lie
from
the
commencement
the
more
evidence
they
found
to
stagger
their
own
senses
upon
the
subject
everywhere
then
in
every
house
public
as
well
as
private
something
was
being
continually
said
of
the
vampyre
nursery
maids
began
to
think
a
vampyre
vastly
superior
to
old
scratch
and
old
bogie
as
a
means
of
terrifying
their
infant
charges
into
quietness
if
not
to
sleep
until
they
themselves
became
too
much
afraid
upon
the
subject
to
mention
it
but
nowhere
was
gossiping
carried
on
upon
the
subject
with
more
systematic
fervour
than
at
an
inn
called
the
nelson's
arms
which
was
in
the
high
street
of
the
nearest
market
town
to
the
hall
there
it
seemed
as
if
the
lovers
of
the
horrible
made
a
point
of
holding
their
head
quarters
and
so
thirsty
did
the
numerous
discussions
make
the
guests
that
the
landlord
was
heard
to
declare
that
he
from
his
heart
really
considered
a
vampyre
as
very
nearly
equal
to
a
contested
election
it
was
towards
evening
of
the
same
day
that
marchdale
and
henry
made
their
visit
to
sir
francis
varney
that
a
postchaise
drew
up
to
the
inn
we
have
mentioned
in
the
vehicle
were
two
persons
of
exceedingly
dissimilar
appearance
and
general
aspect
one
of
these
people
was
a
man
who
seemed
fast
verging
upon
seventy
years
of
age
although
from
his
still
ruddy
and
embrowned
complexion
and
stentorian
voice
it
was
quite
evident
he
intended
yet
to
keep
time
at
arm's-length
for
many
years
to
come
he
was
attired
in
ample
and
expensive
clothing
but
every
article
had
a
naval
animus
about
it
if
we
may
be
allowed
such
an
expression
with
regard
to
clothing
on
his
buttons
was
an
anchor
and
the
general
assortment
and
colour
of
the
clothing
as
nearly
assimilated
as
possible
to
the
undress
naval
uniform
of
an
officer
of
high
rank
some
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
his
companion
was
a
younger
man
and
about
his
appearance
there
was
no
secret
at
all
he
was
a
genuine
sailor
and
he
wore
the
shore
costume
of
one
he
was
hearty-looking
and
well
dressed
and
evidently
well
fed
as
the
chaise
drove
up
to
the
door
of
the
inn
this
man
made
an
observation
to
the
other
to
the
following
effect--
a-hoy
well
you
lubber
what
now
cried
the
other
they
call
this
the
nelson's
arms
and
you
know
shiver
me
that
for
the
best
half
of
his
life
he
had
but
one
d--n
you
was
the
only
rejoinder
he
got
for
this
observation
but
with
that
he
seemed
very
well
satisfied
heave
to
he
then
shouted
to
the
postilion
who
was
about
to
drive
the
chaise
into
the
yard
heave
to
you
lubberly
son
of
a
gun
we
don't
want
to
go
into
dock
ah
said
the
old
man
let's
get
out
jack
this
is
the
port
and
do
you
hear
and
be
cursed
to
you
let's
have
no
swearing
d--n
you
nor
bad
language
you
lazy
swab
aye
aye
cried
jack
i've
not
been
ashore
now
a
matter
o'
ten
years
and
not
larnt
a
little
shore-going
politeness
admiral
i
ain't
been
your
walley
de
sham
without
larning
a
little
about
land
reckonings
nobody
would
take
me
for
a
sailor
now
i'm
thinking
admiral
hold
your
noise
aye
aye
sir
jack
as
he
was
called
bundled
out
of
the
chaise
when
the
door
was
opened
with
a
movement
so
closely
resembling
what
would
have
ensued
had
he
been
dragged
out
by
the
collar
that
one
was
tempted
almost
to
believe
that
such
a
feat
must
have
been
accomplished
all
at
once
by
some
invisible
agency
he
then
assisted
the
old
gentleman
to
alight
and
the
landlord
of
the
inn
commenced
the
usual
profusion
of
bows
with
which
a
passenger
by
a
postchaise
is
usually
welcomed
in
preference
to
one
by
a
stage
coach
be
quiet
will
you
shouted
the
admiral
for
such
indeed
he
was
be
quiet
best
accommodation
sir--good
wine--well-aired
beds--good
attendance--fine
air--
belay
there
said
jack
and
he
gave
the
landlord
what
no
doubt
he
considered
a
gentle
admonition
but
which
consisted
of
such
a
dig
in
the
ribs
that
he
made
as
many
evolutions
as
the
clown
in
a
pantomime
when
he
vociferates
hot
codlings
now
jack
where's
the
sailing
instructions
said
his
master
here
sir
in
the
locker
said
jack
as
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
letter
which
he
handed
to
the
admiral
won't
you
step
in
sir
said
the
landlord
who
had
begun
now
to
recover
a
little
from
the
dig
in
the
ribs
what's
the
use
of
coming
into
port
and
paying
harbour
dues
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
till
we
know
if
it's
the
right
you
lubber
eh
no
oh
dear
me
sir
of
course--god
bless
me
what
can
the
old
gentleman
mean
the
admiral
opened
the
letter
and
read--
if
you
stop
at
the
nelson's
aims
at
uxotter
you
will
hear
of
me
and
i
can
be
sent
for

the
landlord
and

jack
gave
a
long
whistle
and
both
master
and
man
looked
at
each
other
aghast
now
hang

cried
the
admiral
if
ever
i
was
so
taken
in
in
all
my
life
ay

jack

channel
and

he

the
yankee
to
leave

among
the
pirates
i'm
ashamed
on
you

infernal
scoundrel
how
dare
you
preach
to
me

such
a
way

lubberly
rascal
cos

and

very
good

time
then
as
i
was
off
the
purser's
books
good
bye
to
you
i
only
hopes
as
you
may
get
a
better
seaman
to
stick
to
you
and
be
your
walley
de
sham
nor
jack
pringle
that's
all
the
harm
i
wish
you
you
didn't
call
me
no
seaman
in
the
bay
of
corfu
when
the
bullets
were
scuttling
our
nobs
jack
you
rascal
give
us
your
fin
come
here
you
d----d
villain
you'll
leave

i
know

then

tell
me

call
me
a
wagabone
if
you

but
don't
hurt
my
feelings
there

as
tender
as
a
baby
i
am--don't
do
it
confound
you
who
is
doing
it
the
devil
who
is
don't
then
thus
wrangling
they
entered
the
inn
to
the
great
amusement
of
several
bystanders
who
had
collected
to
hear
the
altercation
between
them
would
you
like
a
private
room
sir
said
the
landlord
what's
that
to
you
said
jack
hold
your
noise
will
you
cried
his
master
yes
i
should
like
a
private
room
and
some
grog
strong
as
the
devil
put
in
jack
yes
sir-yes
sir
good
wines--good
beds--good--
you
said
all
that
before
you
know
remarked
jack
as
he
bestowed
upon
the
landlord
another
terrific
dig
in
the
ribs
hilloa
cried
the
admiral
you
can
send
for
that
infernal
lawyer
mister
landlord
mr
crinkles
sir
yes
yes
who
may
i
have
the
honour
to
say
sir
wants
to
see
him
admiral
bell
certainly
admiral
certainly
you'll
find
him
a
very
conversible
nice
gentlemanly
little
man
sir
and
tell
him
as
jack
pringle
is
here
too
cried
the
seaman
oh
yes
yes--of
course
said
the
landlord
who
was
in
such
a
state
of
confusion
from
the
digs
in
the
ribs
he
had
received
and
the
noise
his
guests
had
already
made
in
his
house
that
had
he
been
suddenly
put
upon
his
oath
he
would
scarcely
have
liked
to
say
which
was
the
master
and
which
was
the
man
the
idea
now
jack
said
the
admiral
of
coming
all
this
way
to
see
a
lawyer
ay
ay
sir
if
he'd
said
he
was
a
lawyer
we
would
have
known
what
to
do
but
it's
a
take
in
jack
so
i
think
howsomdever
we'll
serve
him
out
when
we
catch
him
you
know
good--so
we
will
and
then
again
he
may
know
something
about
master
charles
sir
you
know
lord
love
him
don't
you
remember
when
he
came
aboard
to
see
you
once
at
portsmouth
ah
i
do
indeed
and
how
he
said
he
hated
the
french
and
quite
a
baby
too
what
perseverance
and
sense
'uncle'
says
he
to
you
'when
i'm
a
big
man
i'll
go
in
a
ship
and
fight
all
the
french
in
a
heap'
says
he
'and
beat
'em
my
boy
too'
says
you
cos
you
thought
he'd
forgot
that
and
then
he
says
'what's
the
use
of
saying
that
stupid--don't
we
always
beat
'em'
the
admiral
laughed
and
rubbed
his
hands
as
he
cried
aloud--
i
remember
jack--i
remember
him
i
was
stupid
to
make
such
a
remark
i
know
you
was--a
d----d
old
fool
i
thought
you
come
come
hilloa
there
well
then
what
do
you
call
me
no
seaman
for
why
jack
you
bear
malice
like
a
marine
there
you
go
again
goodbye
do
you
remember
when
we
were
yard
arm
to
yard
arm
with
those
two
yankee
frigates
and
took
'em
both
you
didn't
call
me
a
marine
then
when
the
scuppers
were
running
with
blood
was
i
a
seaman
then
you
were
jack--you
were
and
you
saved
my
life
i
didn't
you
did
i
say
i
didn't--it
was
a
marlin-spike
but
i
say
you
did
you
rascally
scoundrel--i
say
you
did
and
i
won't
be
contradicted
in
my
own
ship
call
this
your
ship
no
d--n
it--i--
mr
crinkles
said
the
landlord
flinging
the
door
wide
open
and
so
at
once
putting
an
end
to
the
discussion
which
always
apparently
had
a
tendency
to
wax
exceedingly
warm
the
shark
by
g--d
said
jack
a
little
neatly
dressed
man
made
his
appearance
and
advanced
rather
timidly
into
the
room
perhaps
he
had
heard
from
the
landlord
that
the
parties
who
had
sent
for
him
were
of
rather
a
violent
sort
so
you
are
crinkles
are
you
cried
the
admiral
sit
down
though
you
are
a
lawyer
thank
you
sir
i
am
an
attorney
certainly
and
my
name
as
certainly
is
crinkles
look
at
that
the
admiral
placed
the
letter
in
the
little
lawyer's
hands
who
said--
am
i
to
read
it
yes
to
be
sure
aloud
read
it
to
the
devil
if
you
like
in
a
pig's
whisper
or
a
west
india
hurricane
oh
very
good
sir
i--i
am
willing
to
be
agreeable
so
i'll
read
it
aloud
if
it's
all
the
same
to
you
he
then
opened
the
letter
and
read
as
follows--
to
admiral
bell
admiral--being
from
various
circumstances
aware
that
you
take
a
warm
and
a
praiseworthy
interest
in
your
nephew
charles
holland
i
venture
to
write
to
you
concerning
a
matter
in
which
your
immediate
and
active
co-operation
with
others
may
rescue
him
from
a
condition
which
will
prove
if
allowed
to
continue
very
much
to
his
detriment
and
ultimate
unhappiness
you
are
then
hereby
informed
that
he
charles
holland
has
much
earlier
than
he
ought
to
have
done
returned
to
england
and
that
the
object
of
his
return
is
to
contract
a
marriage
into
a
family
in
every
way
objectionable
and
with
a
girl
who
is
highly
objectionable
you
admiral
are
his
nearest
and
almost
his
only
relative
in
the
world
you
are
the
guardian
of
his
property
and
therefore
it
becomes
a
duty
on
your
part
to
interfere
to
save
him
from
the
ruinous
consequences
of
a
marriage
which
is
sure
to
bring
ruin
and
distress
upon
himself
and
all
who
take
an
interest
in
his
welfare
the
family
he
wishes
to
marry
into
is
named
bannerworth
and
the
young
lady's
name
is
flora
bannerworth
when
however
i
inform
you
that
a
vampyre
is
in
that
family
and
that
if
he
marries
into
it
he
marries
a
vampyre
and
will
have
vampyres
for
children
i
trust
i
have
said
enough
to
warn
you
upon
the
subject
and
to
induce
you
to
lose
no
time
in
repairing
to
the
spot
if
you
stop
at
the
nelson's
arms
at
uxotter
you
will
hear
of
me
i
can
be
sent
for
when
i
will
tell
you
more
yours
very
obediently
and
humbly
josiah
crinkles
ps
i
enclose
you
dr
johnson's
definition
of
a
vampyre
which
is
as
follows
vampyre
a
german
blood-sucker--by
which
you
perceive
how
many
vampyres
from
time
immemorial
must
have
been
well
entertained
at
the
expense
of
john
bull
at
the
court
of
st
james
where
no
thing
hardly
is
to
be
met
with
but
german
blood-suckers
illustration





the
lawyer
ceased
to
read
and
the
amazed
look
with
which
he
glanced
at
the
face
of
admiral
bell
would
under
any
other
circumstances
have
much
amused
him
his
mind
however
was
by
far
too
much
engrossed
with
a
consideration
of
the
danger
of
charles
holland
his
nephew
to
be
amused
at
anything
so
when
he
found
that
the
little
lawyer
said
nothing
he
bellowed
out--
well
sir
we--we--well
said
the
attorney
i've
sent
for
you
and
here
you
are
and
here
i
am
and
here's
jack
pringle
what
have
you
got
to
say
just
this
much
said
mr
crinkles
recovering
himself
a
little
just
this
much
sir
that
i
never
saw
that
letter
before
in
all
my
life
you--never--saw--it
never
didn't
you
write
it
on
my
solemn
word
of
honour
sir
i
did
not
jack
pringle
whistled
and
the
admiral
looked
puzzled
like
the
admiral
in
the
song
too
he
grew
paler
and
then
mr
crinkles
added--
who
has
forged
my
name
to
a
letter
such
as
this
i
cannot
imagine
as
for
writing
to
you
sir
i
never
heard
of
your
existence
except
publicly
as
one
of
those
gallant
officers
who
have
spent
a
long
life
in
nobly
fighting
their
country's
battles
and
who
are
entitled
to
the
admiration
and
the
applause
of
every
englishman
jack
and
the
admiral
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
and
then
the
latter
exclaimed--
what
this
from
a
lawyer
a
lawyer
sir
said
crinkles
may
know
how
to
appreciate
the
deeds
of
gallant
men
although
he
may
not
be
able
to
imitate
them
that
letter
sir
is
a
forgery
and
i
now
leave
you
only
much
gratified
at
the
incident
which
has
procured
me
the
honour
of
an
interview
with
a
gentleman
whose
name
will
live
in
the
history
of
his
country
good
day
sir
good
day
no
i'm
d----d
if
you
go
like
that
said
jack
as
he
sprang
to
the
door
and
put
his
back
against
it
you
shall
take
a
glass
with
me
in
honour
of
the
wooden
walls
of
old
england
d----e
if
you
was
twenty
lawyers
that's
right
jack
said
the
admiral
come
mr
crinkles
i'll
think
for
your
sake
there
may
be
two
decent
lawyers
in
the
world
and
you
one
of
them
we
must
have
a
bottle
of
the
best
wine
the
ship--i
mean
the
house--can
afford
together
if
it
is
your
command
admiral
i
obey
with
pleasure
said
the
attorney
and
although
i
assure
you
on
my
honour
i
did
not
write
that
letter
yet
some
of
the
matters
mentioned
in
it
are
so
generally
notorious
here
that
i
can
afford
you
information
concerning
them
can
you
i
regret
to
say
i
can
for
i
respect
the
parties
sit
down
then--sit
down
jack
run
to
the
steward's
room
and
get
the
wine
we
will
go
into
it
now
starboard
and
larboard
who
the
deuce
could
have
written
that
letter
i
have
not
the
least
idea
sir
well--well
never
mind
it
has
brought
me
here
that's
something
so
i
won't
grumble
much
at
it
i
didn't
know
my
nephew
was
in
england
and
i
dare
say
he
didn't
know
i
was
but
here
we
both
are
and
i
won't
rest
till
i've
seen
him
and
ascertained
how
the
what's-its-name--
the
vampyre
ah
the
vampyre
shiver
my
timbers
said
jack
pringle
who
now
brought
in
some
wine
much
against
the
remonstrances
of
the
waiters
of
the
establishment
who
considered
that
he
was
treading
upon
their
vested
interests
by
so
doing--shiver
my
timbers
if
i
knows
what
a
wamphigher
is
unless
he's
some
distant
relation
to
davy
jones
hold
your
ignorant
tongue
said
the
admiral
nobody
wants
you
to
make
a
remark
you
great
lubber
very
good
said
jack
and
he
sat
down
the
wine
on
the
table
and
then
retired
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
remarking
to
himself
that
he
was
not
called
a
great
lubber
on
a
certain
occasion
when
bullets
were
scuttling
their
nobs
and
they
were
yard
arm
and
yard
arm
with
god
knows
who
now
mister
lawyer
said
admiral
bell
who
had
about
him
a
large
share
of
the
habits
of
a
rough
sailor
now
mister
lawyer
here
is
a
glass
first
to
our
better
acquaintance
for
d----e
if
i
don't
like
you
you
are
very
good
sir
not
at
all
there
was
a
time
when
i'd
just
as
soon
have
thought
of
asking
a
young
shark
to
supper
with
me
in
my
own
cabin
as
a
lawyer
but
i
begin
to
see
that
there
may
be
such
a
thing
as
a
decent
good
sort
of
a
fellow
seen
in
the
law
so
here's
good
luck
to
you
and
you
shall
never
want
a
friend
or
a
bottle
while
admiral
bell
has
a
shot
in
the
locker
gammon
said
jack
d--n
you
what
do
you
mean
by
that
roared
the
admiral
in
a
furious
tone
i
wasn't
speaking
to
you
shouted
jack
about
two
octaves
higher
it's
two
boys
in
the
street
as
is
pretending
they're
a
going
to
fight
and
i
know
d----d
well
they
won't
hold
your
noise
i'm
going
i
wasn't
told
to
hold
my
noise
when
our
nobs
were
being
scuttled
off
beyrout
never
mind
him
mister
lawyer
added
the
admiral
he
don't
know
what
he's
talking
about
never
mind
him
you
go
on
and
tell
me
all
you
know
about
the--the--
the
vampyre
ah
i
always
forget
the
names
of
strange
fish
i
suppose
after
all
it's
something
of
the
mermaid
order
that
i
cannot
say
sir
but
certainly
the
story
in
all
its
painful
particulars
has
made
a
great
sensation
all
over
the
country
indeed
yes
sir
you
shall
hear
how
it
occurred
it
appears
that
one
night
miss
flora
bannersworth
a
young
lady
of
great
beauty
and
respected
and
admired
by
all
who
knew
her
was
visited
by
a
strange
being
who
came
in
at
the
window
my
eye
said
jack
it
waren't
me
i
wish
it
had
a
been
so
petrified
by
fear
was
she
that
she
had
only
time
to
creep
half
out
of
the
bed
and
to
utter
one
cry
of
alarm
when
the
strange
visitor
seized
her
in
his
grasp
d--n
my
pig
tail
said
jack
what
a
squall
there
must
have
been
to
be
sure
do
you
see
this
bottle
roared
the
admiral
to
be
sure
i
does
i
think
as
it's
time
i
seed
another
you
scoundrel
i'll
make
you
feel
it
against
that
d----d
stupid
head
of
yours
if
you
interrupt
this
gentleman
again
don't
be
violent
well
as
i
was
saying
continued
the
attorney
she
did
by
great
good
fortune
manage
to
scream
which
had
the
effect
of
alarming
the
whole
house
the
door
of
her
chamber
which
was
fast
was
broken
open
yes
yes--
ah
cried
jack
you
may
imagine
the
horror
and
the
consternation
of
those
who
entered
the
room
to
find
her
in
the
grasp
of
a
fiend-like
figure
whose
teeth
were
fastened
on
her
neck
and
who
was
actually
draining
her
veins
of
blood
the
devil
before
any
one
could
lay
hands
sufficiently
upon
the
figure
to
detain
it
it
had
fled
precipitately
from
its
dreadful
repast
shots
were
fired
after
it
in
vain
and
they
let
it
go
they
followed
it
i
understand
as
well
as
they
were
able
and
saw
it
scale
the
garden
wall
of
the
premises
there
it
escaped
leaving
as
you
may
well
imagine
on
all
their
minds
a
sensation
of
horror
difficult
to
describe
well
i
never
did
hear
anything
the
equal
of
that
jack
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
haven't
begun
to
think
yet
said
jack
but
what
about
my
nephew
charles
added
the
admiral
of
him
i
know
nothing
nothing
not
a
word
admiral
i
was
not
aware
you
had
a
nephew
or
that
any
gentleman
bearing
that
or
any
other
relationship
to
you
had
any
sort
of
connexion
with
these
mysterious
and
most
unaccountable
circumstances
i
tell
you
all
i
have
gathered
from
common
report
about
this
vampyre
business
further
i
know
not
i
assure
you
well
a
man
can't
tell
what
he
don't
know
it
puzzles
me
to
think
who
could
possibly
have
written
me
this
letter
that
i
am
completely
at
a
loss
to
imagine
said
crinkles
i
assure
you
my
gallant
sir
that
i
am
much
hurt
at
the
circumstance
of
any
one
using
my
name
in
such
a
way
but
nevertheless
as
you
are
here
permit
me
to
say
that
it
will
be
my
pride
my
pleasure
and
the
boast
of
the
remainder
of
my
existence
to
be
of
some
service
to
so
gallant
a
defender
of
my
country
and
one
whose
name
along
with
the
memory
of
his
deeds
is
engraved
upon
the
heart
of
every
briton
quite
ekal
to
a
book
he
talks
said
jack
i
never
could
read
one
myself
on
account
o'
not
knowing
how
but
i've
heard
'em
read
and
that's
just
the
sort
o'
incomprehensible
gammon
we
don't
want
any
of
your
ignorant
remarks
said
the
admiral
so
you
be
quiet
ay
ay
sir
now
mister
lawyer
you
are
an
honest
fellow
and
an
honest
fellow
is
generally
a
sensible
fellow
sir
i
thank
you
if
so
be
as
what
this
letter
says
is
true
my
nephew
charles
has
got
a
liking
for
this
girl
who
has
had
her
neck
bitten
by
a
vampyre
you
see
i
perceive
sir
now
what
would
you
do
one
of
the
most
difficult
as
well
perhaps
as
one
of
the
most
ungracious
of
tasks
said
the
attorney
is
to
interfere
with
family
affairs
the
cold
and
steady
eye
of
reason
generally
sees
things
in
such
very
different
lights
to
what
they
appear
to
those
whose
feelings
and
whose
affections
are
much
compromised
in
their
results
very
true
go
on
taking
my
dear
sir
what
in
my
humble
judgment
appears
to
be
a
reasonable
view
of
this
subject
i
should
say
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
for
your
nephew
to
marry
into
a
family
any
member
of
which
was
liable
to
the
visitations
of
a
vampyre
it
wouldn't
be
pleasant
the
young
lady
might
have
children
oh
lots
cried
jack
hold
your
noise
jack
ay
ay
sir
and
she
might
herself
actually
when
after
death
she
became
a
vampyre
come
and
feed
on
her
own
children
become
a
vampyre
what
is
she
going
to
be
a
vampyre
too
my
dear
sir
don't
you
know
that
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
as
regards
the
physiology
of
vampyres
that
whoever
is
bitten
by
one
of
those
dreadful
beings
becomes
a
vampyre
the
devil
it
is
a
fact
sir
whew
whistled
jack
she
might
bite
us
all
and
we
should
be
a
whole
ship's
crew
o'
wamphighers
there
would
be
a
confounded
go
it's
not
pleasant
said
the
admiral
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
paced
to
and
fro
in
the
room
it's
not
pleasant
hang
me
up
at
my
own
yard-arm
if
it
is
who
said
it
was
cried
jack
who
asked
you
you
brute
well
sir
added
mr
crinkles
i
have
given
you
all
the
information
i
can
and
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
before
had
the
honour
of
saying
more
at
large
namely
that
i
am
your
humble
servant
to
command
and
that
i
shall
be
happy
to
attend
upon
you
at
any
time
thank
ye--thank
ye
mr--a--a--
crinkles
ah
crinkles
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
sir
shortly
now
that
i
am
down
here
i
will
see
to
the
very
bottom
of
this
affair
were
it
deeper
than
fathom
ever
sounded
charles
holland
was
my
poor
sister's
son
he's
the
only
relative
i
have
in
the
wide
world
and
his
happiness
is
dearer
to
my
heart
than
my
own
crinkles
turned
aside
and
by
the
twinkle
of
his
eyes
one
might
premise
that
the
honest
little
lawyer
was
much
affected
god
bless
you
sir
he
said
farewell
good
day
to
you
good-bye
lawyer
cried
jack
mind
how
you
go
d--n
me
if
you
don't
seem
a
decent
sort
of
fellow
and
after
all
you
may
give
the
devil
a
clear
berth
and
get
into
heaven's
straits
with
a
flowing
sheet
provided
as
you
don't
towards
the
end
of
the
voyage
make
any
lubberly
blunders
the
old
admiral
threw
himself
into
a
chair
with
a
deep
sigh
jack
said
he
aye
aye
sir
what's
to
be
done
now
jack
opened
the
window
to
discharge
the
superfluous
moisture
from
an
enormous
quid
he
had
indulged
himself
with
while
the
lawyer
was
telling
about
the
vampyre
and
then
again
turning
his
face
towards
his
master
he
said--
do
what
shall
we
do
why
go
at
once
and
find
out
charles
our
nevy
and
ask
him
all
about
it
and
see
the
young
lady
too
and
lay
hold
o'
the
wamphigher
if
we
can
as
well
and
go
at
the
whole
affair
broadside
to
broadside
till
we
make
a
prize
of
all
the
particulars
after
which
we
can
turn
it
over
in
our
minds
agin
and
see
what's
to
be
done
jack
you
are
right
come
along
i
knows
i
am
do
you
know
now
which
way
to
steer
of
course
not
i
never
was
in
this
latitude
before
and
the
channel
looks
intricate
we
will
hail
a
pilot
jack
and
then
we
shall
be
all
right
and
if
we
strike
it
will
be
his
fault
which
is
a
mighty
great
consolation
said
jack
come
along
the
meeting
of
the
lovers
in
the
garden--an
affecting
scene--the
sudden
appearance
of
sir
francis
varney
illustration
our
readers
will
recollect
that
flora
bannerworth
had
made
an
appointment
with
charles
holland
in
the
garden
of
the
hall
this
meeting
was
looked
forward
to
by
the
young
man
with
a
variety
of
conflicting
feelings
and
he
passed
the
intermediate
time
in
a
most
painful
state
of
doubt
as
to
what
would
be
its
result
the
thought
that
he
should
be
much
urged
by
flora
to
give
up
all
thoughts
of
making
her
his
was
a
most
bitter
one
to
him
who
loved
her
with
so
much
truth
and
constancy
and
that
she
would
say
all
she
could
to
induce
such
a
resolution
in
his
mind
he
felt
certain
but
to
him
the
idea
of
now
abandoning
her
presented
itself
in
the
worst
of
aspects
shall
i
he
said
sink
so
low
in
my
own
estimation
as
well
as
in
hers
and
in
that
of
all
honourable-minded
persons
as
to
desert
her
now
in
the
hour
of
affliction
dare
i
be
so
base
as
actually
or
virtually
to
say
to
her
'flora
when
your
beauty
was
undimmed
by
sorrow--when
all
around
you
seemed
life
and
joy
i
loved
you
selfishly
for
the
increased
happiness
which
you
might
bestow
upon
me
but
now
the
hand
of
misfortune
presses
heavily
upon
you--you
are
not
what
you
were
and
i
desert
you
never--never--never
charles
holland
it
will
be
seen
by
some
of
our
more
philosophic
neighbours
felt
more
acutely
than
he
reasoned
but
let
his
errors
of
argumentation
be
what
they
may
can
we
do
other
than
admire
the
nobility
of
soul
which
dictated
such
a
self
denying
generous
course
as
that
he
was
pursuing
as
for
flora
heaven
only
knows
if
at
that
precise
time
her
intellect
had
completely
stood
the
test
of
the
trying
events
which
had
nearly
overwhelmed
it
the
two
grand
feelings
that
seemed
to
possess
her
mind
were
fear
of
the
renewed
visit
of
the
vampyre
and
an
earnest
desire
to
release
charles
holland
from
his
repeated
vows
of
constancy
towards
her
feeling
generosity
and
judgment
all
revolted
holding
a
young
man
to
such
a
destiny
as
hers
to
link
him
to
her
fate
would
be
to
make
him
to
a
real
extent
a
sharer
in
it
and
the
more
she
heard
fall
from
his
lips
in
the
way
of
generous
feelings
of
continued
attachment
to
her
the
more
severely
did
she
feel
that
he
would
suffer
most
acutely
if
united
to
her
and
she
was
right
the
very
generosity
of
feeling
which
would
have
now
prompted
charles
holland
to
lead
flora
bannerworth
to
the
altar
even
with
the
marks
of
the
vampyre's
teeth
upon
her
throat
gave
an
assurance
of
a
depth
of
feeling
which
would
have
made
him
an
ample
haven
in
all
her
miseries
in
all
her
distresses
and
afflictions
what
was
familiarly
in
the
family
at
the
hall
called
the
garden
was
a
semicircular
piece
of
ground
shaded
in
several
directions
by
trees
and
which
was
exclusively
devoted
to
the
growth
of
flowers
the
piece
of
ground
was
nearly
hidden
from
the
view
of
the
house
and
in
its
centre
was
a
summer-house
which
at
the
usual
season
of
the
year
was
covered
with
all
kinds
of
creeping
plants
of
exquisite
perfumes
and
rare
beauty
all
around
too
bloomed
the
fairest
and
sweetest
of
flowers
which
a
rich
soil
and
a
sheltered
situation
could
produce
alas
though
of
late
many
weeds
had
straggled
up
among
their
more
estimable
floral
culture
for
the
decayed
fortunes
of
the
family
had
prevented
them
from
keeping
the
necessary
servants
to
place
the
hall
and
its
grounds
in
a
state
of
neatness
such
as
it
had
once
been
the
pride
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
to
see
them
it
was
then
in
this
flower-garden
that
charles
and
flora
used
to
meet
as
may
be
supposed
he
was
on
the
spot
before
the
appointed
hour
anxiously
expecting
the
appearance
of
her
who
was
so
really
and
truly
dear
to
him
what
to
him
were
the
sweet
flowers
that
there
grew
in
such
happy
luxuriance
and
heedless
beauty
alas
the
flower
that
to
his
mind
was
fairer
than
them
all
was
blighted
and
in
the
wan
cheek
of
her
whom
he
loved
he
sighed
to
see
the
lily
usurping
the
place
of
the
radiant
rose
dear
dear
flora
he
ejaculated
you
must
indeed
be
taken
from
this
place
which
is
so
full
of
the
most
painful
remembrance
now
i
cannot
think
that
mr
marchdale
somehow
is
a
friend
to
me
but
that
conviction
or
rather
impression
does
not
paralyze
my
judgment
sufficiently
to
induce
me
not
to
acknowledge
that
his
advice
is
good
he
might
have
couched
it
in
pleasanter
words--words
that
would
not
like
daggers
each
have
brought
a
deadly
pang
home
to
my
heart
but
still
i
do
think
that
in
his
conclusion
he
was
right
a
light
sound
as
of
some
fairy
footstep
among
the
flowers
came
upon
his
ears
and
turning
instantly
to
the
direction
from
whence
the
sound
proceeded
he
saw
what
his
heart
had
previously
assured
him
of
namely
that
it
was
his
flora
who
was
coming
illustration
yes
it
was
she
but
ah
how
pale
how
wan--how
languid
and
full
of
the
evidences
of
much
mental
suffering
was
she
where
now
was
the
elasticity
of
that
youthful
step
where
now
was
that
lustrous
beaming
beauty
of
mirthfulness
which
was
wont
to
dawn
in
those
eyes
alas
all
was
changed
the
exquisite
beauty
of
form
was
there
but
the
light
of
joy
which
had
lent
its
most
transcendent
charms
to
that
heavenly
face
was
gone
charles
was
by
her
side
in
a
moment
he
had
her
hand
clasped
in
his
while
his
disengaged
one
was
wound
tenderly
around
her
taper
waist
flora
dear
dear
flora
he
said
you
are
better
tell
me
that
you
feel
the
gentle
air
revives
you
she
could
not
speak
her
heart
was
too
full
of
woe
oh
flora
my
own
my
beautiful
he
added
in
those
tones
which
come
so
direct
from
the
heart
and
which
are
so
different
from
any
assumption
of
tenderness
speak
to
me
dear
dear
flora--speak
to
me
if
it
be
but
a
word
charles
was
all
she
could
say
and
then
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
leant
so
heavily
upon
his
arm
that
it
was
evident
but
for
that
support
she
must
have
fallen
charles
holland
welcomed
those
although
they
grieved
him
so
much
that
he
could
have
accompanied
them
with
his
own
but
then
he
knew
that
she
would
be
soon
now
more
composed
and
that
they
would
relieve
the
heart
whose
sorrows
called
them
into
existence
he
forbore
to
speak
to
her
until
he
found
this
sudden
gush
of
feeling
was
subsiding
into
sobs
and
then
in
low
soft
accents
he
again
endeavoured
to
breathe
comfort
to
her
afflicted
and
terrified
spirit
my
flora
he
said
remember
that
there
are
warm
hearts
that
love
you
remember
that
neither
time
nor
circumstance
can
change
such
endearing
affection
as
mine
ah
flora
what
evil
is
there
in
the
whole
world
that
love
may
not
conquer
and
in
the
height
of
its
noble
feelings
laugh
to
scorn
oh
hush
hush
charles
hush
wherefore
flora
would
you
still
the
voice
of
pure
affection
i
love
you
surely
as
few
have
ever
loved
ah
why
would
you
forbid
me
to
give
such
utterance
as
i
may
to
those
feelings
which
fill
up
my
whole
heart
no--no--no
flora
flora
wherefore
do
you
say
no
do
not
charles
now
speak
to
me
of
affection
or
love
do
not
tell
me
you
love
me
now
not
tell
you
i
love
you
ah
flora
if
my
tongue
with
its
poor
eloquence
to
give
utterance
to
such
a
sentiment
were
to
do
its
office
each
feature
of
my
face
would
tell
the
tale
each
action
would
show
to
all
the
world
how
much
i
loved
you
i
must
not
now
hear
this
great
god
of
heaven
give
me
strength
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
my
soul
what
purpose
is
it
flora
that
you
have
to
pray
thus
fervently
for
strength
to
execute
oh
if
it
savour
aught
of
treason
against
love's
majesty
forget
it
love
is
a
gift
from
heaven
the
greatest
and
the
most
glorious
gift
it
ever
bestowed
upon
its
creatures
heaven
will
not
aid
you
in
repudiating
that
which
is
the
one
grand
redeeming
feature
that
rescues
human
nature
from
a
world
of
reproach
flora
wrung
her
hands
despairingly
as
she
said--
charles
i
know
i
cannot
reason
with
you
i
know
i
have
not
power
of
language
aptitude
of
illustration
nor
depth
of
thought
to
hold
a
mental
contention
with
you
flora
for
what
do
i
contend
you
you
speak
of
love
and
i
have
ere
this
spoken
to
you
of
love
unchecked
yes
yes
before
this
and
now
wherefore
not
now
do
not
tell
me
you
are
changed
i
am
changed
charles
fearfully
changed
the
curse
of
god
has
fallen
upon
me
i
know
not
why
i
know
not
that
in
word
or
in
thought
i
have
done
evil
except
perchance
unwittingly
and
yet--the
vampyre
let
not
that
affright
you
affright
me
it
has
killed
me
nay
flora--you
think
too
much
of
what
i
still
hope
to
be
susceptible
of
far
more
rational
explanation
by
your
own
words
then
charles
i
must
convict
you
i
cannot
i
dare
not
be
yours
while
such
a
dreadful
circumstance
is
hanging
over
me
charles
if
a
more
rational
explanation
than
the
hideous
one
which
my
own
fancy
gives
to
the
form
that
visits
me
can
be
found
find
it
and
rescue
me
from
despair
and
from
madness
they
had
now
reached
the
summer-house
and
as
flora
uttered
these
words
she
threw
herself
on
to
a
seat
and
covering
her
beautiful
face
with
her
hands
she
sobbed
convulsively
you
have
spoken
said
charles
dejectedly
i
have
heard
that
which
you
wished
to
say
to
me
no
no
not
all
charles
i
will
be
patient
then
although
what
more
you
may
have
to
add
should
tear
my
very
heart-strings
i--i
have
to
add
charles
she
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
that
justice
religion
mercy--every
human
attribute
which
bears
the
name
of
virtue
calls
loudly
upon
me
no
longer
to
hold
you
to
vows
made
under
different
auspices
go
on
flora
i
then
implore
you
charles
finding
me
what
i
am
to
leave
me
to
the
fate
which
it
has
pleased
heaven
to
cast
upon
me
i
do
not
ask
you
charles
not
to
love
me
'tis
well
go
on
flora
because
i
should
like
to
think
that
although
i
might
never
see
you
more
you
loved
me
still
but
you
must
think
seldom
of
me
and
you
must
endeavour
to
be
happy
with
some
other--
you
cannot
flora
pursue
the
picture
you
yourself
would
draw
these
words
come
not
from
your
heart
yes--yes--yes
did
you
ever
love
me
charles
charles
why
will
you
add
another
pang
to
those
you
know
must
already
rend
my
heart
no
flora
i
would
tear
my
own
heart
from
my
bosom
ere
i
would
add
one
pang
to
yours
well
i
know
that
gentle
maiden
modesty
would
seal
your
lips
to
the
soft
confession
that
you
loved
me
i
could
not
hope
the
joy
of
hearing
you
utter
these
words
the
tender
devoted
lover
is
content
to
see
the
truthful
passion
in
the
speaking
eyes
of
beauty
content
is
he
to
translate
it
from
a
thousand
acts
which
to
eyes
that
look
not
so
acutely
as
a
lover's
bear
no
signification
but
when
you
tell
me
to
seek
happiness
with
another
well
may
the
anxious
question
burst
from
my
throbbing
heart
of
'did
you
ever
love
me
flora'
her
senses
hung
entranced
upon
his
words
oh
what
a
witchery
is
in
the
tongue
of
love
some
even
of
the
former
colour
of
her
cheek
returned
as
forgetting
all
for
the
moment
but
that
she
was
listening
to
the
voice
of
him
the
thoughts
of
whom
had
made
up
the
day
dream
of
her
happiness
she
gazed
upon
his
face
his
voice
ceased
to
her
it
seemed
as
if
some
music
had
suddenly
left
off
in
its
most
exquisite
passage
she
clung
to
his
arm--she
looked
imploringly
up
to
him
her
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
as
she
cried
charles
charles
i
did
love
you
i
do
love
you
now
then
let
sorrow
and
misfortune
shake
their
grisly
locks
in
vain
he
cried
heart
to
heart--hand
to
hand
with
me
defy
them
he
lifted
up
his
arms
towards
heaven
as
he
spoke
and
at
the
moment
came
such
a
rattling
peal
of
thunder
that
the
very
earth
seemed
to
shake
upon
its
axis
a
half
scream
of
terror
burst
from
the
lips
of
flora
as
she
cried--
what
was
that
only
thunder
said
charles
calmly
'twas
an
awful
sound
a
natural
one
but
at
such
a
moment
when
you
were
defying
fate
to
injure
us
oh
charles
is
it
ominous
flora
can
you
really
give
way
to
such
idle
fancies
the
sun
is
obscured
ay
but
it
will
shine
all
the
brighter
for
its
temporary
eclipse
the
thunder-storm
will
clear
the
air
of
many
noxious
vapours
the
forked
lightning
has
its
uses
as
well
as
its
powers
of
mischief
hark
there
again
another
peal
of
almost
equal
intensity
to
the
other
shook
the
firmament
flora
trembled
charles
she
said
this
is
the
voice
of
heaven
we
must
part--we
must
part
for
ever
i
cannot
be
yours
flora
this
is
madness
think
again
dear
flora
misfortunes
for
a
time
will
hover
over
the
best
and
most
fortunate
of
us
but
like
the
clouds
that
now
obscure
the
sweet
sunshine
will
pass
away
and
leave
no
trace
behind
them
the
sunshine
of
joy
will
shine
on
you
again
there
was
a
small
break
in
the
clouds
like
a
window
looking
into
heaven
from
it
streamed
one
beam
of
sunlight
so
bright
so
dazzling
and
so
beautiful
that
it
was
a
sight
of
wonder
to
look
upon
it
fell
upon
the
face
of
flora
it
warmed
her
cheek
it
lent
lustre
to
her
pale
lips
and
tearful
eyes
it
illumined
that
little
summer-house
as
if
it
had
been
the
shrine
of
some
saint
behold
cried
charles
where
is
your
omen
now
god
of
heaven'
cried
flora
and
she
stretched
out
her
arms
the
clouds
that
hover
over
your
spirit
now
said
charles
shall
pass
away
accept
this
beam
of
sunlight
as
a
promise
from
god
i
will--i
will
it
is
going
it
has
done
its
office
the
clouds
closed
over
the
small
orifice
and
all
was
gloom
again
as
before
flora
said
charles
you
will
not
ask
me
now
to
leave
you
she
allowed
him
to
clasp
her
to
his
heart
it
was
beating
for
her
and
for
her
only
you
will
let
me
flora
love
you
still
her
voice
as
she
answered
him
was
like
the
murmur
of
some
distant
melody
the
ears
can
scarcely
translate
to
the
heart
charles
we
will
live
love
and
die
together
and
now
there
was
a
wrapt
stillness
in
that
summer-house
for
many
minutes--a
trance
of
joy
they
did
not
speak
but
now
and
then
she
would
look
into
his
face
with
an
old
familiar
smile
and
the
joy
of
his
heart
was
near
to
bursting
in
tears
from
his
eyes
a
shriek
burst
from
flora's
lips--a
shriek
so
wild
and
shrill
that
it
awakened
echoes
far
and
near
charles
staggered
back
a
step
as
if
shot
and
then
in
such
agonised
accents
as
he
was
long
indeed
in
banishing
the
remembrance
of
she
cried--
the
vampyre
the
vampyre
the
explanation--the
arrival
of
the
admiral
at
the
house--a
scene
of
confusion
and
some
of
its
results
illustration
so
sudden
and
so
utterly
unexpected
a
cry
of
alarm
from
flora
at
such
a
time
might
well
have
the
effect
of
astounding
the
nerves
of
any
one
and
no
wonder
that
charles
was
for
a
few
seconds
absolutely
petrified
and
almost
unable
to
think
mechanically
then
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
door
of
the
summer-house
and
there
he
saw
a
tall
thin
man
rather
elegantly
dressed
whose
countenance
certainly
in
its
wonderful
resemblance
to
the
portrait
on
the
panel
might
well
appal
any
one
the
stranger
stood
in
the
irresolute
attitude
on
the
threshold
of
the
summer-house
of
one
who
did
not
wish
to
intrude
but
who
found
it
as
awkward
if
not
more
so
now
to
retreat
than
to
advance
before
charles
holland
could
summon
any
words
to
his
aid
or
think
of
freeing
himself
from
the
clinging
grasp
of
flora
which
was
wound
around
him
the
stranger
made
a
very
low
and
courtly
bow
after
which
he
said
in
winning
accents--
i
very
much
fear
that
i
am
an
intruder
here
allow
me
to
offer
my
warmest
apologies
and
to
assure
you
sir
and
you
madam
that
i
had
no
idea
any
one
was
in
the
arbour
you
perceive
the
rain
is
falling
smartly
and
i
made
towards
here
seeing
it
was
likely
to
shelter
me
from
the
shower
these
words
were
spoken
in
such
a
plausible
and
courtly
tone
of
voice
that
they
might
well
have
become
any
drawing-room
in
the
kingdom
flora
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
during
the
utterance
of
these
words
and
as
she
convulsively
clutched
the
arm
of
charles
she
kept
on
whispering--
the
vampyre
the
vampyre
i
much
fear
added
the
stranger
in
the
same
bland
tones
that
i
have
been
the
cause
of
some
alarm
to
the
young
lady
release
me
whispered
charles
to
flora
release
me
i
will
follow
him
at
once
no
no--do
not
leave
me--do
not
leave
me
the
vampyre--the
dreadful
vampyre
but
flora--
hush--hush--hush
it
speaks
again
perhaps
i
ought
to
account
for
my
appearance
in
the
garden
at
all
added
the
insinuating
stranger
the
fact
is
i
came
on
a
visit--
flora
shuddered
to
mr
henry
bannerworth
continued
the
stranger
and
finding
the
garden-gate
open
i
came
in
without
troubling
the
servants
which
i
much
regret
as
i
can
perceive
i
have
alarmed
and
annoyed
the
lady
madam
pray
accept
of
my
apologies
in
the
name
of
god
who
are
you
said
charles
my
name
is
varney
oh
yes
you
are
the
sir
francis
varney
residing
close
by
who
bears
so
fearful
a
resemblance
to--
pray
go
on
sir
i
am
all
attention
to
a
portrait
here
indeed
now
i
reflect
a
moment
mr
henry
bannerworth
did
incidentally
mention
something
of
the
sort
it's
a
most
singular
coincidence
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
was
now
plainly
heard
and
in
a
few
moments
henry
and
george
along
with
mr
marchdale
reached
the
spot
their
appearance
showed
that
they
had
made
haste
and
henry
at
once
exclaimed--
we
heard
or
fancied
we
heard
a
cry
of
alarm
you
did
hear
it
said
charles
holland
do
you
know
this
gentleman
it
is
sir
francis
varney
indeed
varney
bowed
to
the
new
comers
and
was
altogether
as
much
at
his
ease
as
everybody
else
seemed
quite
the
contrary
even
charles
holland
found
the
difficulty
of
going
up
to
such
a
well-bred
gentlemanly
man
and
saying
sir
we
believe
you
to
be
a
vampyre--to
be
almost
if
not
insurmountable
i
cannot
do
it
he
thought
but
i
will
watch
him
take
me
away
whispered
flora
'tis
he--'tis
he
oh
take
me
away
charles
hush
flora
hush
you
are
in
some
error
the
accidental
resemblance
should
not
make
us
be
rude
to
this
gentleman
the
vampyre--it
is
the
vampyre
are
you
sure
flora
do
i
know
your
features--my
own--my
brother's
do
not
ask
me
to
doubt--i
cannot
i
am
quite
sure
take
me
from
his
hideous
presence
charles
the
young
lady
i
fear
is
very
much
indisposed
remarked
sir
francis
varney
in
a
sympathetic
tone
of
voice
if
she
will
accept
of
my
arm
i
shall
esteem
it
a
great
honour
no--no--no--god
no
cried
flora
madam
i
will
not
press
you
he
bowed
and
charles
led
flora
from
the
summer-house
towards
the
hall
flora
he
said
i
am
bewildered--i
know
not
what
to
think
that
man
most
certainly
has
been
fashioned
after
the
portrait
which
is
on
the
panel
in
the
room
you
formerly
occupied
or
it
has
been
painted
from
him
he
is
my
midnight
visitor
exclaimed
flora
he
is
the
vampyre--this
sir
francis
varney
is
the
vampyre
good
god
what
can
be
done
i
know
not
i
am
nearly
distracted
be
calm
flora
if
this
man
be
really
what
you
name
him
we
now
know
from
what
quarter
the
mischief
comes
which
is
at
all
events
a
point
gained
be
assured
we
shall
place
a
watch
upon
him
oh
it
is
terrible
to
meet
him
here
and
he
is
so
wonderfully
anxious
too
to
possess
the
hall
he
is--he
is
it
looks
strange
the
whole
affair
but
flora
be
assured
of
one
thing
and
that
is
of
your
own
safety
can
i
be
assured
of
that
most
certainly
go
to
your
mother
now
here
we
are
you
see
fairly
within
doors
go
to
your
mother
dear
flora
and
keep
yourself
quiet
i
will
return
to
this
mysterious
man
now
with
a
cooler
judgment
than
i
left
him
you
will
watch
him
charles
i
will
indeed
and
you
will
not
let
him
approach
the
house
here
alone
i
will
not
oh
that
the
almighty
should
allow
such
beings
to
haunt
the
earth
hush
flora
hush
we
cannot
judge
of
his
allwise
purpose
'tis
hard
that
the
innocent
should
be
inflicted
with
its
presence
charles
bowed
his
head
in
mournful
assent
illustration
is
it
not
very
very
dreadful
hush--hush
calm
yourself
dearest
calm
yourself
recollect
that
all
we
have
to
go
upon
in
this
matter
is
a
resemblance
which
after
all
may
be
accidental
but
leave
it
all
to
me
and
be
assured
that
now
i
have
some
clue
to
this
affair
i
will
not
lose
sight
of
it
or
of
sir
francis
varney
so
saying
charles
surrendered
flora
to
the
care
of
her
mother
and
then
was
hastening
back
to
the
summer-house
when
he
met
the
whole
party
coming
towards
the
hall
for
the
rain
was
each
moment
increasing
in
intensity
we
are
returning
remarked
sir
francis
varney
with
a
half
bow
and
a
smile
to
charles
allow
me
said
henry
to
introduce
you
mr
holland
to
our
neighbour
sir
francis
varney
charles
felt
himself
compelled
to
behave
with
courtesy
although
his
mind
was
so
full
of
conflicting
feelings
as
regarded
varney
but
there
was
no
avoiding
without
such
brutal
rudeness
as
was
inconsistent
with
all
his
pursuits
and
habits
replying
in
something
like
the
same
strain
to
the
extreme
courtly
politeness
of
the
supposed
vampyre
i
will
watch
him
closely
thought
charles
i
can
do
no
more
than
watch
him
closely
sir
francis
varney
seemed
to
be
a
man
of
the
most
general
and
discursive
information
he
talked
fluently
and
pleasantly
upon
all
sorts
of
topics
and
notwithstanding
he
could
not
but
have
heard
what
flora
had
said
of
him
he
asked
no
questions
whatever
upon
that
subject
this
silence
as
regarded
a
matter
which
would
at
once
have
induced
some
sort
of
inquiry
from
any
other
man
charles
felt
told
much
against
him
and
he
trembled
to
believe
for
a
moment
that
after
all
it
really
might
be
true
is
he
a
vampyre
he
asked
himself
are
there
vampyres
and
is
this
man
of
fashion--this
courtly
talented
educated
gentleman
one
it
was
a
perfectly
hideous
question
you
are
charmingly
situated
here
remarked
varney
as
after
ascending
the
few
steps
that
led
to
the
hall
door
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
view
from
that
slight
altitude
the
place
has
been
much
esteemed
said
henry
for
its
picturesque
beauties
of
scenery
and
well
it
may
be
i
trust
mr
holland
the
young
lady
is
much
better
she
is
sir
said
charles
i
was
not
honoured
by
an
introduction
it
was
my
fault
said
henry
who
spoke
to
his
extraordinary
guest
with
an
air
of
forced
hilarity
it
was
my
fault
for
not
introducing
you
to
my
sister
and
that
was
your
sister
it
was
sir
report
has
not
belied
her--she
is
beautiful
but
she
looks
rather
pale
i
thought
has
she
bad
health
the
best
of
health
indeed
perhaps
the
little
disagreeable
circumstance
which
is
made
so
much
food
for
gossip
in
the
neighbourhood
has
affected
her
spirits
it
has
you
allude
to
the
supposed
visit
here
of
a
vampyre
said
charles
as
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
varney's
face
yes
i
allude
to
the
supposed
appearance
of
a
supposed
vampyre
in
this
family
said
sir
francis
varney
as
he
returned
the
earnest
gaze
of
charles
with
such
unshrinking
assurance
that
the
young
man
was
compelled
after
about
a
minute
nearly
to
withdraw
his
own
eyes
he
will
not
be
cowed
thought
charles
use
has
made
him
familiar
to
such
cross-questioning
it
appeared
now
suddenly
to
occur
to
henry
that
he
had
said
something
at
varney's
own
house
which
should
have
prevented
him
from
coming
to
the
hall
and
he
now
remarked--
we
scarcely
expected
the
pleasure
of
your
company
here
sir
francis
varney
oh
my
dear
sir
i
am
aware
of
that
but
you
roused
my
curiosity
you
mentioned
to
me
that
there
was
a
portrait
here
amazingly
like
me
did
i
indeed
you
did
or
how
could
i
know
it
i
wanted
to
see
if
the
resemblance
was
so
perfect
did
you
hear
sir
added
henry
that
my
sister
was
alarmed
at
your
likeness
to
that
portrait
no
really
i
pray
you
walk
in
and
we
will
talk
more
at
large
upon
that
matter
with
great
pleasure
one
leads
a
monotonous
life
in
the
country
when
compared
with
the
brilliancy
of
a
court
existence
just
now
i
have
no
particular
engagement
as
we
are
near
neighbours
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
be
good
friends
and
often
interchange
such
civilities
as
make
up
the
amenities
of
existence
and
which
in
the
country
more
particularly
are
valuable
henry
could
not
be
hypocrite
enough
to
assent
to
this
but
still
under
the
present
aspect
of
affairs
it
was
impossible
to
return
any
but
a
civil
reply
so
he
said--
oh
yes
of
course--certainly
my
time
is
very
much
occupied
and
my
sister
and
mother
see
no
company
oh
now
how
wrong
wrong
sir
yes
surely
if
anything
more
than
another
tends
to
harmonize
individuals
it
is
the
society
of
that
fairer
half
of
the
creation
which
we
love
for
their
very
foibles
i
am
much
attached
to
the
softer
sex--to
young
persons
full
of
health
i
like
to
see
the
rosy
checks
where
the
warm
blood
mantles
in
the
superficial
veins
and
all
is
loveliness
and
life
charles
shrank
back
and
the
word
demon
unconsciously
escaped
his
lips
sir
francis
took
no
manner
of
notice
of
the
expression
but
went
on
talking
as
if
he
had
been
on
the
very
happiest
terms
with
every
one
present
will
you
follow
me
at
once
to
the
chamber
where
the
portrait
hangs
said
henry
or
will
you
partake
of
some
refreshment
first
no
refreshment
for
me
said
varney
my
dear
friend
if
you
will
permit
me
to
call
you
such
this
is
a
time
of
the
day
at
which
i
never
do
take
any
refreshment
nor
at
any
other
thought
henry
they
all
went
to
the
chamber
where
charles
had
passed
one
very
disagreeable
night
and
when
they
arrived
henry
pointed
to
the
portrait
on
the
panel
saying--
there
sir
francis
varney
is
your
likeness
he
looked
and
having
walked
up
to
it
in
an
under
tone
rather
as
if
he
were
conversing
with
himself
than
making
a
remark
for
any
one
else
to
hear
he
said--
it
is
wonderfully
like
it
is
indeed
said
charles
if
i
stand
beside
it
thus
said
varney
placing
himself
in
a
favourable
attitude
for
comparing
the
two
faces
i
dare
say
you
will
be
more
struck
with
the
likeness
than
before
so
accurate
was
it
now
that
the
same
light
fell
upon
his
face
as
that
under
which
the
painter
had
executed
the
portrait
that
all
started
back
a
step
or
two
some
artists
remarked
varney
have
the
sense
to
ask
where
a
portrait
is
to
be
hung
before
they
paint
it
and
then
they
adapt
their
lights
and
shadows
to
those
which
would
fall
upon
the
original
were
it
similarly
situated
i
cannot
stand
this
said
charles
to
henry
i
must
question
him
farther
as
you
please
but
do
not
insult
him
i
will
not
he
is
beneath
my
roof
now
and
after
all
it
is
but
a
hideous
suspicion
we
have
of
him
rely
upon
me
charles
stepped
forward
and
once
again
confronting
varney
with
an
earnest
gaze
he
said--
do
you
know
sir
that
miss
bannerworth
declares
the
vampyre
she
fancies
to
have
visited
this
chamber
to
be
in
features
the
exact
counterpart
of
this
portrait
does
she
indeed
she
does
indeed
and
perhaps
then
that
accounts
for
her
thinking
that
i
am
the
vampyre
because
i
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
portrait
i
should
not
be
surprised
said
charles
how
very
odd
very
and
yet
entertaining
i
am
rather
amused
than
otherwise
the
idea
of
being
a
vampyre
ha
ha
if
ever
i
go
to
a
masquerade
again
i
shall
certainly
assume
the
character
of
a
vampyre
you
would
do
it
well
i
dare
say
now
i
should
make
quite
a
sensation
i
am
certain
you
would
do
you
not
think
gentlemen
that
sir
francis
varney
would
enact
the
character
to
the
very
life
by
heavens
he
would
do
it
so
well
that
one
might
without
much
difficulty
really
imagine
him
a
vampyre
bravo--bravo
said
varney
as
he
gently
folded
his
hands
together
with
that
genteel
applause
that
may
even
be
indulged
in
in
a
box
at
the
opera
itself
bravo
i
like
to
see
young
persons
enthusiastic
it
looks
as
if
they
had
some
of
the
real
fire
of
genius
in
their
composition
bravo--bravo
this
was
charles
thought
the
very
height
and
acme
of
impudence
and
yet
what
could
he
do
what
could
he
say
he
was
foiled
by
the
downright
coolness
of
varney
as
for
henry
george
and
mr
marchdale
they
had
listened
to
what
was
passing
between
sir
francis
and
charles
in
silence
they
feared
to
diminish
the
effect
of
anything
charles
might
say
by
adding
a
word
of
their
own
and
likewise
they
did
not
wish
to
lose
one
observation
that
might
come
from
the
lips
of
varney
but
now
charles
appeared
to
have
said
all
he
had
to
say
he
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
he
seemed
like
a
man
who
had
made
up
his
mind
for
a
time
to
give
up
some
contest
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
and
perhaps
not
so
much
did
he
give
it
up
from
any
feeling
or
consciousness
of
being
beaten
as
from
a
conviction
that
it
could
be
the
more
effectually
at
some
other
and
far
more
eligible
opportunity
renewed
varney
now
addressed
henry
saying--
i
presume
the
subject
of
our
conference
when
you
did
me
the
honour
of
a
call
is
no
secret
to
any
one
here
none
whatever
said
henry
then
perhaps
i
am
too
early
in
asking
you
if
you
have
made
up
your
mind
i
have
scarcely
certainly
had
time
to
think
my
dear
sir
do
not
let
me
hurry
you
i
much
regret
indeed
the
intrusion
you
seem
anxious
to
possess
the
hall
remarked
mr
marchdale
to
varney
i
am
is
it
new
to
you
not
quite
i
have
some
boyish
recollections
connected
with
this
neighbourhood
among
which
bannerworth
hall
stands
sufficiently
prominent
may
i
ask
how
long
ago
that
was
said
charles
howard
rather
abruptly
i
do
not
recollect
my
enthusiastic
young
friend
said
varney
how
old
are
you
just
about
twenty-one
you
are
then
for
your
age
quite
a
model
of
discretion
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
the
most
accurate
observer
of
human
nature
to
have
decided
whether
this
was
said
truthfully
or
ironically
so
charles
made
no
reply
to
it
whatever
i
trust
said
henry
we
shall
induce
you
as
this
is
your
first
visit
sir
francis
varney
to
the
hall
to
partake
of
some
thing
well
well
a
cup
of
wine--
is
at
your
service
henry
now
led
the
way
to
a
small
parlour
which
although
by
no
means
one
of
the
showiest
rooms
of
the
house
was
from
the
care
and
exquisite
carving
with
which
it
abounded
much
more
to
the
taste
of
any
who
possessed
an
accurate
judgment
in
such
works
of
art
then
wine
was
ordered
and
charles
took
an
opportunity
of
whispering
to
henry--
notice
well
if
he
drinks
i
will
do
you
see
that
beneath
his
coat
there
is
a
raised
place
as
if
his
arm
was
bound
up
i
do
there
then
was
where
the
bullet
from
the
pistol
fired
by
flora
when
we
were
at
the
church
hit
him
hush
for
god's
sake
hush
you
are
getting
into
a
dreadful
state
of
excitement
charles
hush
hush
and
can
you
blame--
no
no
but
what
can
we
do
you
are
right
nothing
can
we
do
at
present
we
have
a
clue
now
and
be
it
our
mutual
inclination
as
well
as
duty
to
follow
it
oh
you
shall
see
how
calm
i
will
be
for
heaven's
sake
be
so
i
have
noted
that
his
eyes
flash
upon
yours
with
no
friendly
feeling
his
friendship
were
a
curse
hush
he
drinks
watch
him
i
will
gentlemen
all
said
sir
francis
varney
in
such
soft
dulcet
tones
that
it
was
quite
a
fascination
to
hear
him
speak
gentlemen
all
being
as
i
am
much
delighted
with
your
company
do
not
accuse
me
of
presumption
if
i
drink
now
poor
drinker
as
i
am
to
our
future
merry
meetings
he
raised
the
wine
to
his
lips
and
seemed
to
drink
after
which
he
replaced
the
glass
upon
the
table
charles
glanced
at
it
it
was
still
full
you
have
not
drank
sir
francis
varney
he
said
pardon
me
enthusiastic
young
sir
said
varney
perhaps
you
will
have
the
liberality
to
allow
me
to
take
my
wine
how
i
please
and
when
i
please
your
glass
is
full
well
sir
will
you
drink
it
not
at
any
man's
bidding
most
certainly
if
the
fair
flora
bannerworth
would
grace
the
board
with
her
sweet
presence
methinks
i
could
then
drink
on
on
on
hark
you
sir
cried
charles
i
can
bear
no
more
of
this
we
have
had
in
this
house
most
horrible
and
damning
evidence
that
there
are
such
things
as
vampyres
have
you
really
i
suppose
you
eat
raw
pork
at
supper
and
so
had
the
nightmare
a
jest
is
welcome
in
its
place
but
pray
hear
me
out
sir
if
it
suit
your
lofty
courtesy
to
do
so
oh
certainly
then
i
say
we
believe
as
far
as
human
judgment
has
a
right
to
go
that
a
vampyre
has
been
here
go
on
it's
interesting
i
always
was
a
lover
of
the
wild
and
the
wonderful
we
have
too
continued
charles
some
reason
to
believe
that
you
are
the
man
varney
tapped
his
forehead
as
he
glanced
at
henry
and
said--
oh
dear
i
did
not
know
you
should
have
told
me
he
was
a
little
wrong
about
the
brain
i
might
have
quarreled
with
the
lad
dear
me
how
lamentable
for
his
poor
mother
this
will
not
do
sir
francis
varney
alias
bannerworth
oh--oh
be
calm--be
calm
i
defy
you
to
your
teeth
sir
no
god
no
your
teeth
poor
lad
poor
lad
you
are
a
cowardly
demon
and
here
i
swear
to
devote
myself
to
your
destruction
sir
francis
varney
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
that
was
immense
as
he
said
to
henry--
i
pray
you
mr
bannerworth
since
i
am
thus
grievously
insulted
beneath
your
roof
to
tell
me
if
your
friend
here
be
mad
or
sane
he's
not
mad
then--
hold
sir
the
quarrel
shall
be
mine
in
the
name
of
my
persecuted
sister--in
the
name
of
heaven
sir
francis
varney
i
defy
you
sir
francis
in
spite
of
his
impenetrable
calmness
appeared
somewhat
moved
as
he
said--
i
have
already
endured
insult
sufficient--i
will
endure
no
more
if
there
are
weapons
at
hand--
my
young
friend
interrupted
mr
marchdale
stepping
between
the
excited
men
is
carried
away
by
his
feelings
and
knows
not
what
he
says
you
will
look
upon
it
in
that
light
sir
francis
we
need
no
interference
exclaimed
varney
his
hitherto
bland
voice
changing
to
one
of
fury
the
hot
blooded
fool
wishes
to
fight
and
he
shall--to
the
death--to
the
death
illustration
and
i
say
he
shall
not
exclaimed
mr
marchdale
taking
henry
by
the
arm
george
he
added
turning
to
the
young
man
assist
me
in
persuading
your
brother
to
leave
the
room
conceive
the
agony
of
your
sister
and
mother
if
anything
should
happen
to
him
varney
smiled
with
a
devilish
sneer
as
he
listened
to
these
words
and
then
he
said--
as
you
will--as
you
will
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
and
perhaps
better
opportunity
gentlemen
i
bid
you
good
day
and
with
provoking
coolness
he
then
moved
towards
the
door
and
quitted
the
room
remain
here
said
marchdale
i
will
follow
him
and
see
that
he
quits
the
premises
he
did
so
and
the
young
men
from
the
window
beheld
sir
francis
walking
slowly
across
the
garden
and
then
saw
mr
marchdale
follow
on
his
track
while
they
were
thus
occupied
a
tremendous
ringing
came
at
the
gate
but
their
attention
was
so
rivetted
to
what
was
passing
in
the
garden
that
they
paid
not
the
least
attention
to
it
the
admiral's
advice--the
challenge
to
the
vampyre--the
new
servant
at
the
hall
illustration
the
violent
ringing
of
the
bell
continued
uninterruptedly
until
at
length
george
volunteered
to
answer
it
the
fact
was
that
now
there
was
no
servant
at
all
in
the
place
for
after
the
one
who
had
recently
demanded
of
henry
her
dismissal
had
left
the
other
was
terrified
to
remain
alone
and
had
precipitately
gone
from
the
house
without
even
going
through
the
ceremony
of
announcing
her
intention
to
to
be
sure
she
sent
a
boy
for
her
money
afterwards
which
may
be
considered
a
great
act
of
condescension
suspecting
then
this
state
of
things
george
himself
hastened
to
the
gate
and
being
not
over
well
pleased
at
the
continuous
and
unnecessary
ringing
which
was
kept
up
at
it
he
opened
it
quickly
and
cried
with
more
impatience
by
a
vast
amount
than
was
usual
with
him
who
is
so
impatient
that
he
cannot
wait
a
seasonable
time
for
the
door
to
be
opened
and
who
the
d----l
are
you
cried
one
who
was
immediately
outside
who
do
you
want
cried
george
shiver
my
timbers
cried
admiral
bell
for
it
was
no
other
than
that
personage
what's
that
to
you
ay
ay
added
jack
answer
that
if
you
can
you
shore-going-looking
swab
two
madmen
i
suppose
ejaculated
george
and
he
would
have
closed
the
gate
upon
them
but
jack
introduced
between
it
and
the
post
the
end
of
a
thick
stick
saying--
avast
there
none
of
that
we
have
had
trouble
enough
to
get
in
if
you
are
the
family
lawyer
or
the
chaplain
perhaps
you'll
tell
us
where
mister
charley
is
once
more
i
demand
of
you
who
you
want
said
george
who
was
now
perhaps
a
little
amused
at
the
conduct
of
the
impatient
visitors
we
want
the
admiral's
nevey
said
jack
but
how
do
i
know
who
is
the
admiral's
nevey
as
you
call
him
why
charles
holland
to
be
sure
have
you
got
him
aboard
or
not
mr
charles
holland
is
certainly
here
and
if
you
had
said
at
once
and
explicitly
that
you
wished
to
see
him
i
could
have
given
you
a
direct
answer
he
is
here
cried
the
admiral
most
certainly
come
along
then
yet
stop
a
bit
i
say
young
fellow
just
before
we
go
any
further
tell
us
if
he
has
maimed
the
vampyre
the
what
the
wamphigher
said
jack
by
way
of
being
as
he
considered
a
little
more
explanatory
than
the
admiral
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
said
george
if
you
wish
to
see
mr
charles
holland
walk
in
and
see
him
he
is
in
this
house
but
for
myself
as
you
are
strangers
to
me
i
decline
answering
any
questions
let
their
import
be
what
they
may
hilloa
who
are
they
suddenly
cried
jack
as
he
pointed
to
two
figures
some
distance
off
in
the
meadows
who
appeared
to
be
angrily
conversing
george
glanced
in
the
direction
towards
which
jack
pointed
and
there
he
saw
sir
francis
varney
and
mr
marchdale
standing
within
a
few
paces
of
each
other
and
apparently
engaged
in
some
angry
discussion
his
first
impulse
was
to
go
immediately
towards
them
but
before
he
could
execute
even
that
suggestion
of
his
mind
he
saw
varney
strike
marchdale
and
the
latter
fell
to
the
ground
allow
me
to
pass
cried
george
as
he
endeavoured
to
get
by
the
rather
unwieldy
form
of
the
admiral
but
before
he
could
accomplish
this
for
the
gate
was
narrow
he
saw
varney
with
great
swiftness
make
off
and
marchdale
rising
to
his
feet
came
towards
the
hall
when
marchdale
got
near
enough
to
the
garden-gate
to
see
george
he
motioned
to
him
to
remain
where
he
was
and
then
quickening
his
pace
he
soon
came
up
to
the
spot
marchdale
cried
george
you
have
had
an
encounter
with
sir
francis
varney
i
have
said
marchdale
in
an
excited
manner
i
threatened
to
follow
him
but
he
struck
me
to
the
earth
as
easily
as
i
could
a
child
his
strength
is
superhuman
i
saw
you
fall
i
believe
but
that
he
was
observed
he
would
have
murdered
me
indeed
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
lankey
horse-marine
looking
fellow
is
as
bad
as
that
said
the
admiral
marchdale
now
turned
his
attention
to
the
two
new
comers
upon
whom
he
looked
with
some
surprise
and
then
turning
to
george
he
said--
is
this
gentleman
a
visitor
to
mr
holland
i
believe
he
is
said
george
but
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
his
name
oh
you
may
know
my
name
as
soon
as
you
like
cried
the
admiral
the
enemies
of
old
england
know
it
and
i
don't
care
if
all
the
world
knows
it
i'm
old
admiral
bell
something
of
a
hulk
now
but
still
able
to
head
a
quarter-deck
if
there
was
any
need
to
do
so
ay
ay
cried
jack
and
taking
from
his
pocket
a
boatswain's
whistle
he
blew
a
blast
so
long
and
loud
and
shrill
that
george
was
fain
to
cover
his
ears
with
his
hands
to
shut
out
the
brain-piercing
and
to
him
unusual
sound
and
are
you
then
a
relative
said
marchdale
of
mr
holland's
sir
may
i
ask
i'm
his
uncle
and
be
d----d
to
him
if
you
must
know
and
some
one
has
told
me
that
the
young
scamp
thinks
of
marrying
a
mermaid
or
a
ghost
or
a
vampyre
or
some
such
thing
so
for
the
sake
of
the
memory
of
his
poor
mother
i've
come
to
say
no
to
the
bargain
and
d--n
me
who
cares
come
in
sir
said
george
i
will
conduct
you
to
mr
holland
i
presume
this
is
your
servant
why
not
exactly
that's
jack
pringle
he
was
my
boatswain
you
see
and
now
he's
a
kind
o'
something
betwixt
and
between
not
exactly
a
servant
ay
ay
sir
said
jack
have
it
all
your
own
way
though
we
is
paid
off
hold
your
tongue
you
audacious
scoundrel
will
you
oh
i
forgot
you
don't
like
anything
said
about
paying
off
cos
it
puts
you
in
mind
of--
now
d--n
you
i'll
have
you
strung
up
to
the
yard-arm
you
dog
if
you
don't
belay
there
i'm
done
all's
right
by
this
time
the
party
including
the
admiral
jack
george
bannerworth
and
marchdale
had
got
more
than
half-way
across
the
garden
and
were
observed
by
charles
holland
and
henry
who
had
come
to
the
steps
of
the
hall
to
see
what
was
going
on
the
moment
charles
saw
the
admiral
a
change
of
colour
came
over
his
face
and
he
exclaimed--
by
all
that's
surprising
there
is
my
uncle
your
uncle
said
henry
yes
as
good
a
hearted
a
man
as
ever
drew
breath
and
yet
withal
as
full
of
prejudices
and
as
ignorant
of
life
as
a
child
without
waiting
for
any
reply
from
henry
charles
holland
rushed
forward
and
seizing
his
uncle
by
the
hand
he
cried
in
tones
of
genuine
affection--
uncle
dear
uncle
how
came
you
to
find
me
out
charley
my
boy
cried
the
old
man
bless
you
i
mean
confound
your
d----d
impudence
you
rascal
i'm
glad
to
see
you
no
i
ain't
you
young
mutineer
what
do
you
mean
by
it
you
ugly
ill-looking
d----d
fine
fellow--my
dear
boy
oh
you
infernal
scoundrel
all
this
was
accompanied
by
a
shaking
of
the
hand
which
was
enough
to
dislocate
anybody's
shoulder
and
which
charles
was
compelled
to
bear
as
well
as
he
could
it
quite
prevented
him
from
speaking
however
for
a
few
moments
for
it
nearly
shook
the
breath
out
of
him
when
then
he
could
get
in
a
word
he
said--
uncle
i
dare
say
you
are
surprised
surprised
d--n
me
i
am
surprised
well
i
shall
be
able
to
explain
all
to
your
satisfaction
i
am
sure
allow
me
now
to
introduce
you
to
my
friends
turning
then
to
henry
charles
said--
this
is
mr
henry
bannerworth
uncle
and
this
mr
george
bannerworth
both
good
friends
of
mine
and
this
is
mr
marchdale
a
friend
of
theirs
uncle
oh
indeed
and
here
you
see
admiral
bell
my
most
worthy
but
rather
eccentric
uncle
confound
your
impudence
what
brought
him
here
i
cannot
tell
but
he
is
a
brave
officer
and
a
gentleman
none
of
your
nonsense
said
the
admiral
and
here
you
sees
jack
pringle
said
that
individual
introducing
himself
since
no
one
appeared
inclined
to
do
that
office
for
him
a
tar
for
all
weathers
one
as
hates
the
french
and
is
never
so
happy
as
when
he's
alongside
o'
some
o'
those
lubberly
craft
blazing
away
that's
uncommonly
true
remarked
the
admiral
will
you
walk
in
sir
said
henry
courteously
any
friend
of
charles
holland's
is
most
welcome
here
you
will
have
much
to
excuse
us
for
because
we
are
deficient
in
servants
at
present
in
consequence
of
come
occurrences
in
our
family
which
your
nephew
has
our
full
permission
to
explain
to
you
in
full
oh
very
good
i
tell
you
what
it
is
all
of
you
what
i've
seen
of
you
d----e
i
like
so
here
goes
come
along
jack
the
admiral
walked
into
the
house
and
as
he
went
charles
holland
said
to
him--
how
came
you
to
know
i
was
here
uncle
some
fellow
wrote
me
a
despatch
indeed
yes
saying
at
you
was
a
going
to
marry
some
odd
sort
of
fish
as
it
wasn't
at
all
the
thing
to
introduce
into
the
family
was--was
a
vampyre
mentioned
that's
the
very
thing
hush
uncle--hush
what
for
do
not
i
implore
hint
at
such
a
thing
before
these
kind
friends
of
mine
i
will
take
an
opportunity
within
the
next
hour
of
explaining
all
to
you
and
you
shall
form
your
own
kind
and
generous
judgement
upon
circumstances
in
which
my
honour
and
my
happiness
are
so
nearly
concerned
gammon
said
the
admiral
what
uncle
oh
i
know
you
want
to
palaver
me
into
saying
it's
all
right
i
suppose
if
my
judgment
and
generosity
don't
like
it
i
shall
be
an
old
fool
and
a
cursed
goose
now
uncle
now
nevey
well
well--no
more
at
present
we
will
talk
over
this
at
leisure
you
promise
me
to
say
nothing
about
it
until
you
have
heard
my
explanation
uncle
very
good
make
it
as
soon
as
you
can
and
as
short
as
you
can
that's
all
i
ask
of
you
i
will
i
will
charles
was
to
the
full
as
anxious
as
his
uncle
could
be
to
enter
upon
the
subject
some
remote
information
of
which
he
felt
convinced
had
brought
the
old
man
down
to
the
hall
who
it
could
have
been
that
so
far
intermeddled
with
his
affairs
as
to
write
to
him
he
could
not
possibly
conceive
a
very
few
words
will
suffice
to
explain
the
precise
position
in
which
charles
holland
was
a
considerable
sum
of
money
had
been
left
to
him
but
it
was
saddled
with
the
condition
that
he
should
not
come
into
possession
of
it
until
he
was
one
year
beyond
the
age
which
is
usually
denominated
that
of
discretion
namely
twenty-one
his
uncle
the
admiral
was
the
trustee
of
his
fortune
and
he
with
rare
discretion
had
got
the
active
and
zealous
assistance
of
a
professional
gentleman
of
great
honour
and
eminence
to
conduct
the
business
for
him
this
gentleman
had
advised
that
for
the
two
years
between
the
ages
of
twenty
and
twenty-two
charles
holland
should
travel
inasmuch
as
in
english
society
he
would
find
himself
in
an
awkward
position
being
for
one
whole
year
of
age
and
yet
waiting
for
his
property
under
such
circumstances
reasoned
the
lawyer
a
young
man
unless
he
is
possessed
of
very
rare
discretion
indeed
is
almost
sure
to
get
fearfully
involved
with
money-lenders
being
of
age
his
notes
and
bills
and
bonds
would
all
be
good
and
he
would
be
in
a
ten
times
worse
situation
than
a
wealthy
minor
all
this
was
duly
explained
to
charles
who
rather
eagerly
than
otherwise
caught
at
the
idea
of
a
two
years
wander
on
the
continent
where
he
could
visit
so
many
places
which
to
a
well
read
young
man
like
himself
and
one
of
a
lively
imagination
were
full
of
the
most
delightful
associations
but
the
acquaintance
with
flora
bannerworth
effected
a
great
revolution
in
his
feelings
the
dearest
sweetest
spot
on
earth
became
that
which
she
inhabited
when
the
bannerworths
left
him
abroad
he
knew
not
what
to
do
with
himself
everything
and
every
pursuit
in
which
he
had
before
taken
a
delight
became
most
distasteful
to
him
he
was
in
fact
in
a
short
time
completely
used
up
and
then
he
determined
upon
returning
to
england
and
finding
out
the
dear
object
of
his
attachment
at
once
this
resolution
was
no
sooner
taken
than
his
health
and
spirits
returned
to
him
and
with
what
rapidity
he
could
he
now
made
his
way
to
his
native
shores
the
two
years
were
so
nearly
expired
that
he
made
up
his
mind
he
would
not
communicate
either
with
his
uncle
the
admiral
or
the
professional
gentleman
upon
whose
judgment
he
set
so
high
and
so
just
a
value
and
at
the
hall
he
considered
he
was
in
perfect
security
from
any
interruption
and
so
he
would
have
been
but
for
that
letter
which
was
written
to
admiral
bell
and
signed
josiah
crinkles
but
which
josiah
crinkles
so
emphatically
denied
all
knowledge
of
who
wrote
it
remains
at
present
one
of
those
mysteries
which
time
in
the
progress
of
our
narrative
will
clear
up
the
opportune
or
rather
the
painful
juncture
at
which
charles
holland
had
arrived
at
bannerworth
hall
we
are
well
cognisant
of
where
he
expected
to
find
smiles
he
found
tears
and
the
family
with
whom
he
had
fondly
hoped
he
should
pass
a
time
of
uninterrupted
happiness
he
found
plunged
in
the
gloom
incidental
to
an
occurrence
of
the
most
painful
character
our
readers
will
perceive
too
that
coming
as
he
did
with
an
utter
disbelief
in
the
vampyre
charles
had
been
compelled
in
some
measure
to
yield
to
the
overwhelming
weight
of
evidence
which
had
been
brought
to
bear
upon
the
subject
and
although
he
could
not
exactly
be
said
to
believe
in
the
existence
and
the
appearance
of
the
vampyre
at
bannerworth
hall
he
was
upon
the
subject
in
a
most
painful
state
of
doubt
and
indecision
charles
now
took
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
henry
privately
and
inform
him
exactly
how
he
stood
with
his
uncle
adding--
now
my
dear
friend
if
you
forbid
me
i
will
not
tell
my
uncle
of
this
sad
affair
but
i
must
own
i
would
rather
do
so
fully
and
freely
and
trust
to
his
own
judgment
upon
it
i
implore
you
to
do
so
said
henry
conceal
nothing
let
him
know
the
precise
situation
and
circumstances
of
the
family
by
all
means
there
is
nothing
so
mischievous
as
secrecy
i
have
the
greatest
dislike
to
it
i
beg
you
tell
him
all
i
will
and
with
it
henry
i
will
tell
him
that
my
heart
is
irrevocably
flora's
your
generous
clinging
to
one
whom
your
heart
saw
and
loved
under
very
different
auspices
said
henry
believe
me
charles
sinks
deep
into
my
heart
she
has
related
to
me
something
of
a
meeting
she
had
with
you
oh
henry
she
may
tell
you
what
i
said
but
there
are
no
words
which
can
express
the
depth
of
my
tenderness
'tis
only
time
which
can
prove
how
much
i
love
her
go
to
your
uncle
said
henry
in
a
voice
of
emotion
god
bless
you
charles
it
is
true
you
would
have
been
fully
justified
in
leaving
my
sister
but
the
nobler
and
the
more
generous
path
you
have
chosen
has
endeared
you
to
us
all
where
is
flora
now
said
charles
she
is
in
her
own
room
i
have
persuaded
her
by
some
occupation
to
withdraw
her
mind
from
a
too
close
and
consequently
painful
contemplation
of
the
distressing
circumstances
in
which
she
feels
herself
placed
you
are
right
what
occupation
best
pleases
her
the
pages
of
romance
once
had
a
charm
for
her
gentle
spirit
then
come
with
me
and
from
among
the
few
articles
i
brought
with
me
here
i
can
find
some
papers
which
may
help
her
to
pass
some
merry
hours
charles
took
henry
to
his
room
and
unstrapping
a
small
valise
he
took
from
it
some
manuscript
papers
one
of
which
he
handed
to
henry
saying--
give
that
to
her
it
contains
an
account
of
a
wild
adventure
and
shows
that
human
nature
may
suffer
much
more--and
that
wrongfully
too--than
came
ever
under
our
present
mysterious
affliction
i
will
said
henry
and
coming
from
you
i
am
sure
it
will
have
a
more
than
ordinary
value
in
her
eyes
i
will
now
said
charles
seek
my
uncle
i
will
tell
him
how
i
love
her
and
at
the
end
of
my
narration
if
he
should
not
object
i
would
fain
introduce
her
to
him
that
he
might
himself
see
that
let
what
beauty
may
have
met
his
gaze
her
peer
he
never
yet
met
with
and
may
in
vain
hope
to
do
so
you
are
partial
charles
not
so
'tis
true
i
look
upon
her
with
a
lover's
eyes
but
i
look
still
with
those
of
truthful
observation
well
i
will
speak
to
her
about
seeing
your
uncle
and
let
you
know
no
doubt
he
will
not
be
at
all
averse
to
an
interview
with
any
one
who
stands
high
in
your
esteem
the
young
men
now
separated--henry
to
seek
his
beautiful
sister
and
charles
to
communicate
to
his
uncle
the
strange
particulars
connected
with
varney
the
vampyre
flora
in
her
chamber--her
fears--the
manuscript--an
adventure
illustration
henry
found
flora
in
her
chamber
she
was
in
deep
thought
when
he
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
room
and
such
was
the
state
of
nervous
excitement
in
which
she
was
that
even
the
demand
for
admission
made
by
him
to
the
room
was
sufficient
to
produce
from
her
a
sudden
cry
of
alarm
who--who
is
there
she
then
said
in
accents
full
of
terror
'tis
i
dear
flora
said
henry
she
opened
the
door
in
an
instant
and
with
a
feeling
of
grateful
relief
exclaimed--
oh
henry
is
it
only
you
who
did
you
suppose
it
was
flora
she
shuddered
i--i--do
not
know
but
i
am
so
foolish
now
and
so
weak-spirited
that
the
slightest
noise
is
enough
to
alarm
me
you
must
dear
flora
fight
up
as
i
had
hoped
you
were
doing
against
this
nervousness
i
will
endeavour
did
not
some
strangers
come
a
short
time
since
brother
strangers
to
us
flora
but
not
to
charles
holland
a
relative
of
his--an
uncle
whom
he
much
respects
has
found
him
out
here
and
has
now
come
to
see
him
and
to
advise
him
said
flora
as
she
sunk
into
a
chair
and
wept
bitterly
to
advise
him
of
course
to
desert
as
he
would
a
pestilence
a
vampyre
bride
hush
hush
for
the
sake
of
heaven
never
make
use
of
such
a
phrase
flora
you
know
not
what
a
pang
it
brings
to
my
heart
to
hear
you
oh
forgive
me
brother
say
no
more
of
it
flora
heed
it
not
it
may
be
possible--in
fact
it
may
well
be
supposed
as
more
than
probable--that
the
relative
of
charles
holland
may
shrink
from
sanctioning
the
alliance
but
do
you
rest
securely
in
the
possession
of
the
heart
which
i
feel
convinced
is
wholly
yours
and
which
i
am
sure
would
break
ere
it
surrendered
you
a
smile
of
joy
came
across
flora's
pale
but
beautiful
face
as
she
cried--
and
you
dear
brother--you
think
so
much
of
charles's
faith
as
heaven
is
my
judge
i
do
then
i
will
bear
up
with
what
strength
god
may
give
me
against
all
things
that
seek
to
depress
me
i
will
not
be
conquered
you
are
right
flora
i
rejoice
to
find
in
you
such
a
disposition
here
is
some
manuscript
which
charles
thinks
will
amuse
you
and
he
bade
me
ask
you
if
you
would
be
introduced
to
his
uncle
yes
yes--willingly
i
will
tell
him
so
i
know
he
wishes
it
and
i
will
tell
him
so
be
patient
dear
flora
and
all
may
yet
be
well
but
brother
on
your
sacred
word
tell
me
do
you
not
think
this
sir
francis
varney
is
the
vampyre
i
know
not
what
to
think
and
do
not
press
me
for
a
judgment
now
he
shall
be
watched
henry
left
his
sister
and
she
sat
for
some
moments
in
silence
with
the
papers
before
her
that
charles
had
sent
her
yes
she
then
said
gently
he
loves
me--charles
loves
me
i
ought
to
be
very
very
happy
he
loves
me
in
those
words
are
concentrated
a
whole
world
of
joy--charles
loves
me--he
will
not
forsake
me
oh
was
there
ever
such
dear
love--such
fond
devotion--never
never
dear
charles
he
loves
me--he
loves
me
the
very
repetition
of
these
words
had
a
charm
for
flora--a
charm
which
was
sufficient
to
banish
much
sorrow
even
the
much-dreaded
vampyre
was
forgotten
while
the
light
of
love
was
beaming
upon
her
and
she
told
herself--
he
is
mine--he
is
mine
he
loves
me
truly
after
a
time
she
turned
to
the
manuscript
which
her
brother
had
brought
her
and
with
a
far
greater
concentration
of
mind
than
she
had
thought
it
possible
she
could
bring
to
it
considering
the
many
painful
subjects
of
contemplation
that
she
might
have
occupied
herself
with
she
read
the
pages
with
very
great
pleasure
and
interest
the
tale
was
one
which
chained
her
attention
both
by
its
incidents
and
the
manner
of
its
recital
it
commenced
as
follows
and
was
entitled
hugo
de
verole
or
the
double
plot
in
a
very
mountainous
part
of
hungary
lived
a
nobleman
whose
paternal
estates
covered
many
a
mile
of
rock
and
mountain
land
as
well
as
some
fertile
valleys
in
which
reposed
a
hardy
and
contented
peasantry
the
old
count
de
hugo
de
verole
had
quitted
life
early
and
had
left
his
only
son
the
then
count
hugo
de
verole
a
boy
of
scarcely
ten
years
under
the
guardianship
of
his
mother
an
arbitrary
and
unscrupulous
woman
the
count
her
husband
had
been
one
of
those
quiet
even-tempered
men
who
have
no
desire
to
step
beyond
the
sphere
in
which
they
are
placed
he
had
no
cares
save
those
included
in
the
management
of
his
estate
the
prosperity
of
his
serfs
and
the
happiness
of
those
around
him
his
death
caused
much
lamentation
throughout
his
domains
it
was
so
sudden
and
unexpected
being
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
health
and
strength
until
a
few
hours
previous
and
then
his
energies
became
prostrated
by
pain
and
disease
there
was
a
splendid
funeral
ceremony
which
according
to
the
usages
of
his
house
took
place
by
torch-light
so
great
and
rapid
were
the
ravages
of
disease
that
the
count's
body
quickly
became
a
mass
of
corruption
all
were
amazed
at
the
phenomena
and
were
heartily
glad
when
the
body
was
disposed
of
in
the
place
prepared
for
its
reception
in
the
vaults
of
his
own
castle
the
guests
who
came
to
witness
the
funeral
and
attend
the
count's
obsequies
and
to
condole
with
the
widow
on
the
loss
she
had
sustained
were
entertained
sumptuously
for
many
days
the
widow
sustained
her
part
well
she
was
inconsolable
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
and
mourned
his
death
bitterly
her
grief
appeared
profound
but
she
with
difficulty
subdued
it
to
within
decent
bounds
that
she
might
not
offend
any
of
her
numerous
guests
however
they
left
her
with
the
assurances
of
their
profound
regard
and
then
when
they
were
gone
when
the
last
guest
had
departed
and
were
no
longer
visible
to
the
eye
of
the
countess
as
she
gazed
from
the
battlements
then
her
behaviour
changed
totally
she
descended
from
the
battlements
and
then
with
an
imperious
gesture
she
gave
her
orders
that
all
the
gates
of
the
castle
should
be
closed
and
a
watch
set
all
signs
of
mourning
she
ordered
to
be
laid
on
one
side
save
her
own
which
she
wore
and
then
she
retired
to
her
own
apartment
where
she
remained
unseen
here
the
countess
remained
in
profound
meditation
for
nearly
two
days
during
which
time
the
attendants
believed
she
was
praying
for
the
welfare
of
the
soul
of
their
deceased
master
and
they
feared
she
would
starve
herself
to
death
if
she
remained
any
longer
just
as
they
had
assembled
together
for
the
purpose
of
either
recalling
her
from
her
vigils
or
breaking
open
the
door
they
were
amazed
to
see
the
countess
open
the
room-door
and
stand
in
the
midst
of
them
what
do
you
here
she
demanded
in
a
stern
voice
the
servants
were
amazed
and
terrified
at
her
contracted
brow
and
forgot
to
answer
the
question
she
put
to
them
what
do
you
do
here
we
came
my
lady
to
see--see--if--if
you
were
well
and
why
because
we
hadn't
seen
your
ladyship
these
two
days
and
we
thought
that
your
grief
was
so
excessive
that
we
feared
some
harm
might
befall
you
the
countess's
brows
contracted
for
a
few
seconds
and
she
was
about
to
make
a
hasty
reply
but
she
conquered
the
desire
to
do
so
and
merely
said--
i
am
not
well
i
am
faint
but
had
i
been
dying
i
should
not
have
thanked
you
for
interfering
to
prevent
me
however
you
acted
for
the
best
but
do
so
no
more
now
prepare
me
some
food
the
servants
thus
dismissed
repaired
to
their
stations
but
with
such
a
degree
of
alacrity
that
they
sufficiently
showed
how
much
they
feared
their
mistress
the
young
count
who
was
only
in
his
sixth
year
knew
little
about
the
loss
he
had
sustained
but
after
a
day
or
two's
grief
there
was
an
end
of
his
sorrow
for
the
time
that
night
there
came
to
the
castle-gate
a
man
dressed
in
a
black
cloak
attended
by
a
servant
they
were
both
mounted
on
good
horses
and
they
demanded
to
be
admitted
to
the
presence
of
the
countess
de
hugo
de
verole
the
message
was
carried
to
the
countess
who
started
but
said--
admit
the
stranger
accordingly
the
stranger
was
admitted
and
shown
into
the
apartment
where
the
countess
was
sitting
at
a
signal
the
servants
retired
leaving
the
countess
and
the
stranger
alone
it
was
some
moments
ere
they
spoke
and
then
the
countess
said
in
a
low
tone--
you
are
come
i
am
come
you
cannot
now
you
see
perform
your
threat
my
husband
the
count
caught
a
putrid
disease
and
he
is
no
more
i
cannot
indeed
do
what
i
intended
inform
your
husband
of
your
amours
but
i
can
do
something
as
good
and
which
will
give
you
as
much
annoyance
indeed
aye
more
it
will
cause
you
to
be
hated
i
can
spread
reports
you
can
and
these
may
ruin
you
they
may
what
do
you
intend
to
do
do
you
intend
that
i
shall
be
an
enemy
or
a
friend
i
can
be
either
according
to
my
will
what
do
you
desire
to
be
either
inquired
the
countess
with
a
careless
tone
if
you
refuse
my
terms
you
can
make
me
an
implacable
enemy
and
if
you
grant
them
you
can
make
me
a
useful
friend
and
auxiliary
said
the
stranger
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
my
enemy
inquired
the
countess
it
is
hardly
my
place
said
the
stranger
to
furnish
you
with
a
knowledge
of
my
intentions
but
i
will
say
this
much
that
the
bankrupt
count
of
morven
is
your
lover
well
and
in
the
second
place
that
you
were
the
cause
of
the
death
of
your
husband
how
dare
you
sir--
i
dare
say
so
much
and
i
dare
say
also
that
the
count
of
morven
bought
the
drug
of
me
and
that
he
gave
it
to
you
and
that
you
gave
it
to
the
count
your
husband
and
what
could
you
do
if
you
were
my
friend
inquired
the
countess
in
the
same
tone
and
without
emotion
i
should
abstain
from
doing
all
this
should
be
able
to
put
any
one
else
out
of
your
way
for
you
when
you
get
rid
of
this
count
of
morven
as
you
assuredly
will
for
i
know
him
too
well
not
to
be
sure
of
that
get
rid
of
him
exactly
in
the
same
manner
you
got
rid
of
the
old
count
then
i
accept
your
terms
it
is
agreed
then
yes
quite
well
then
you
must
order
me
some
rooms
in
a
tower
where
i
can
pursue
my
studies
in
quiet
you
will
be
seen--and
noticed--all
will
be
discovered
no
indeed
i
will
take
care
of
that
i
can
so
far
disguise
myself
that
he
will
not
recognise
me
and
you
can
give
out
i
am
a
philosopher
or
necromancer
or
what
you
will
no
one
will
come
to
me--they
will
be
terrified
very
well
and
the
gold
shall
be
forthcoming
as
soon
as
i
can
get
it
the
count
has
placed
all
his
gold
in
safe
keeping
and
all
i
can
seize
are
the
rents
as
they
become
due
very
well
but
let
me
have
them
in
the
meantime
you
must
provide
for
me
as
i
have
come
here
with
the
full
intention
of
staying
here
or
in
some
neighbouring
town
indeed
yes
and
my
servant
must
be
discharged
as
i
want
none
here
the
countess
called
to
an
attendant
and
gave
the
necessary
orders
and
afterwards
remained
some
time
with
the
stranger
who
had
thus
so
unceremoniously
thrust
himself
upon
her
and
insisted
upon
staying
under
such
strange
and
awful
circumstances





the
count
of
morven
came
a
few
weeks
after
and
remained
some
days
with
the
countess
they
were
ceremonious
and
polite
until
they
had
a
moment
to
retire
from
before
people
when
the
countess
changed
her
cold
disdain
to
a
cordial
and
familiar
address
and
now
my
dear
morven
she
exclaimed
as
soon
as
they
were
unobserved--and
now
my
dear
morven
that
we
are
not
seen
tell
me
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
why
i
have
been
in
some
trouble
i
never
had
gold
that
would
stay
by
me
you
know
my
hand
was
always
open
the
old
complaint
again
no
but
having
come
to
the
end
of
my
store
i
began
to
grow
serious
ah
morven'
said
the
countess
reproachfully
well
never
mind
when
my
purse
is
low
my
spirits
sink
as
the
mercury
does
with
the
cold
you
used
to
say
my
spirits
were
mercurial--i
think
they
were
well
what
did
you
do
oh
nothing
was
that
what
you
were
about
to
tell
me
inquired
the
countess
oh
dear
no
you
recollect
the
italian
quack
of
whom
i
bought
the
drug
you
gave
to
the
count
and
which
put
an
end
to
his
days--he
wanted
more
money
well
as
i
had
no
more
to
spare
i
could
spare
no
more
to
him
and
he
turned
vicious
and
threatened
i
threatened
too
and
he
knew
i
was
fully
able
and
willing
to
perform
any
promise
i
might
make
to
him
on
that
score
i
endeavoured
to
catch
him
as
he
had
already
began
to
set
people
off
on
the
suspicious
and
marvellous
concerning
me
and
if
i
could
have
come
across
him
i
would
have
laid
him
very
low
indeed
and
you
could
not
find
him
no
i
could
not
illustration
well
then
i
will
tell
you
where
he
is
at
this
present
moment
you
yes
i
i
can
scarcely
credit
my
senses
at
what
you
say
said
count
morven
my
worthy
doctor
you
are
little
better
than
a
candidate
for
divine
honours
but
where
is
he
will
you
promise
to
be
guided
by
me
said
the
countess
if
you
make
it
a
condition
upon
which
you
grant
the
information
i
must
well
then
i
take
that
as
a
promise
you
may
where--oh
where
is
he
remember
your
promise
your
doctor
is
at
this
moment
in
this
castle
this
castle
yes
this
castle
surely
there
must
be
some
mistake
it
is
too
much
fortune
at
once
he
came
here
for
the
same
purpose
he
went
to
you
indeed
yes
to
get
more
money
by
extortion
and
a
promise
to
poison
anybody
i
liked
d--n
it
is
the
offer
he
made
to
me
and
he
named
you
he
named
you
to
me
and
said
i
should
be
soon
tired
of
you
you
have
caged
him
oh
dear
no
he
has
a
suite
of
apartments
in
the
eastern
tower
where
he
passes
for
a
philosopher
or
a
wizard
as
people
like
best
how
i
have
given
him
leave
there
indeed
yes
and
what
is
more
amazing
is
that
he
is
to
aid
me
in
poisoning
you
when
i
have
become
tired
of
you
this
is
a
riddle
i
cannot
unravel
tell
me
the
solution
well
dear
listen--he
came
to
me
and
told
me
of
something
i
already
knew
and
demanded
money
and
a
residence
for
his
convenience
and
i
have
granted
him
the
asylum
you
have
i
have
i
see
i
will
give
him
an
inch
or
two
of
my
andrea
ferrara
no--no
do
you
countenance
him
for
a
time
listen--we
want
men
in
the
mines
my
late
husband
sent
very
few
to
them
of
late
years
and
therefore
they
are
getting
short
of
men
there
aye
aye
the
thing
will
be
for
you
to
feign
ignorance
of
the
man
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
get
him
seized
and
placed
in
the
mines
for
such
men
as
he
are
dangerous
and
carry
poisoned
weapons
would
he
not
be
better
out
of
the
world
at
once
there
would
be
no
escape
and
no
future
contingencies
no--no
i
will
have
no
more
lives
taken
and
he
will
be
made
useful
and
moreover
he
will
have
time
to
reflect
upon
the
mistake
he
had
made
in
threatening
me
he
was
paid
for
the
job
and
he
had
no
future
claim
but
what
about
the
child
oh
he
may
remain
for
some
time
longer
here
with
us
it
will
be
dangerous
to
do
so
said
the
count
he
is
now
ten
years
old
and
there
is
no
knowing
what
may
be
done
for
him
by
his
relatives
they
dare
not
enter
the
gates
of
this
castle
morven
well
well
but
you
know
he
might
have
travelled
the
same
road
as
his
father
and
all
would
be
settled
no
more
lives
as
i
told
you
but
we
can
easily
secure
him
some
other
way
and
we
shall
be
equally
as
free
from
him
and
them
that
is
enough--there
are
dungeons
i
know
in
this
castle
and
he
can
be
kept
there
safe
enough
he
can
but
that
is
not
what
i
propose
we
can
put
him
into
the
mines
and
confine
him
as
a
lunatic
excellent
you
see
we
must
make
those
mines
more
productive
somehow
or
other
they
would
be
so
but
the
count
would
not
hear
of
it
he
said
it
was
so
inhuman
they
were
so
destructive
of
life
paha
what
were
the
mines
intended
for
if
not
for
use
exactly--i
often
said
so
but
he
always
put
a
negative
to
it
we'll
make
use
of
an
affirmative
my
dear
countess
and
see
what
will
be
the
result
in
a
change
of
policy
by
the
way
when
will
our
marriage
be
celebrated
not
for
some
months
how
so
long
i
am
impatient
you
must
restrain
your
impatience--but
we
must
have
the
boy
settled
first
and
the
count
will
have
been
dead
a
longer
time
then
and
we
shall
not
give
so
much
scandal
to
the
weak-minded
fools
that
were
his
friends
for
it
will
be
dangerous
to
have
so
many
events
happen
about
the
same
period
you
shall
act
as
you
think
proper--but
the
first
thing
to
be
done
will
be
to
get
this
cunning
doctor
quietly
out
of
the
way
yes
i
must
contrive
to
have
him
seized
and
carried
to
the
mines
beneath
the
tower
in
which
he
lives
is
a
trap-door
and
a
vault
from
which
by
means
of
another
trap
and
vault
is
a
long
subterranean
passage
that
leads
to
a
door
that
opens
into
one
end
of
the
mines
near
this
end
live
several
men
whom
you
must
give
some
reward
to
and
they
will
by
concert
seize
him
and
set
him
to
work
and
if
he
will
not
work
why
they
will
scourge
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
would
be
afraid
even
of
a
threat
of
a
repetition
of
the
same
treatment
that
will
do
but
i
think
the
worthy
doctor
will
split
himself
with
rage
and
malice
he
will
be
like
a
caged
tiger
but
he
will
be
denuded
of
his
teeth
and
claws
replied
the
countess
smiling
therefore
he
will
have
leisure
to
repent
of
having
threatened
his
employers





some
weeks
passed
over
and
the
count
of
morven
contrived
to
become
acquainted
with
the
doctor
they
appeared
to
be
utter
strangers
to
each
other
though
each
knew
the
other
the
doctor
having
disguised
himself
he
believed
the
disguise
impenetrable
and
therefore
sat
at
ease
worthy
doctor
said
the
count
to
him
one
day
you
have
no
doubt
in
your
studies
become
acquainted
with
many
of
the
secrets
of
science
i
have
my
lord
count
i
may
say
there
are
few
that
are
not
known
to
father
aldrovani
i
have
spent
many
years
in
research
indeed
yes
the
midnight
lamp
has
burned
till
the
glorious
sun
has
reached
the
horizon
and
brings
back
the
day
and
yet
have
i
been
found
beside
my
books
'tis
well
men
like
you
should
well
know
the
value
of
the
purest
and
most
valuable
metals
the
earth
produces
i
know
of
but
one--that
is
gold
'tis
what
i
mean
but
'tis
hard
to
procure
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth--from
the
heart
of
these
mountains
by
which
we
are
surrounded
yes
that
is
true
but
know
you
not
the
owners
of
this
castle
and
territory
possess
these
mines
and
work
them
i
believe
they
do
but
i
thought
they
had
discontinued
working
them
some
years
oh
no
that
was
given
out
to
deceive
the
government
who
claimed
so
much
out
of
its
products
oh
ah
aye
i
see
now
and
ever
since
they
have
been
working
it
privately
and
storing
bars
of
gold
up
in
the
vaults
of
this--
here
in
this
castle
yes
beneath
this
very
tower--it
being
the
least
frequented--the
strongest
and
perfectly
inaccessible
from
all
sides
save
the
castle--it
was
placed
there
for
the
safest
deposit
i
see
and
there
is
much
gold
deposited
in
the
vaults
i
believe
there
is
an
immense
quantity
in
the
vaults
and
what
is
your
motive
for
telling
me
of
this
hoard
of
the
precious
metal
why
doctor
i
thought
that
you
or
i
could
use
a
few
bars
and
that
if
we
acted
in
concert
we
might
be
able
to
take
away
at
various
times
and
secrete
in
some
place
or
other
enough
to
make
us
rich
men
for
all
our
lives
i
should
like
to
see
this
gold
before
i
said
anything
about
it
replied
the
doctor
thoughtfully
as
you
please
do
you
find
a
lamp
that
will
not
go
out
by
the
sudden
draughts
of
air
or
have
the
means
of
relighting
it
and
i
will
accompany
you
when
this
very
night
good
doctor
when
you
shall
see
such
a
golden
harvest
you
never
yet
hoped
for
or
even
believed
in
to-night
be
it
then
replied
the
doctor
i
will
have
a
lamp
that
will
answer
our
purpose
and
some
other
matters
do
good
doctor
and
the
count
left
the
philosopher's
cell





the
plan
takes
said
the
count
to
the
countess
give
me
the
keys
and
the
worthy
man
will
be
in
safety
before
daylight
is
he
not
suspicious
not
at
all





that
night
about
an
hour
before
midnight--the
count
morven
stole
towards
the
philosopher's
room
he
tapped
at
the
door
enter
said
the
philosopher
the
count
entered
and
saw
the
philosopher
seated
and
by
him
a
lamp
of
peculiar
construction
and
incased
in
gauze
wire
and
a
cloak
are
you
ready
inquired
the
count
quite
he
replied
is
that
your
lamp
it
is
follow
me
then
and
hold
the
lamp
tolerably
high
as
the
way
is
strange
and
the
steps
steep
lead
on
you
have
made
up
your
mind
i
dare
say
as
to
what
share
of
the
undertaking
you
will
accept
of
with
me
and
what
if
i
will
not
said
the
philosopher
coolly
it
falls
to
the
ground
and
i
return
the
keys
to
their
place
i
dare
say
i
shall
not
refuse
if
you
have
not
deceived
me
as
to
the
quantity
and
purity
of
the
metal
they
have
stored
up
i
am
no
judge
of
these
metals
doctor
i
am
no
assayest
but
i
believe
you
will
find
what
i
have
to
show
you
will
far
exceed
your
expectations
on
that
head
'tis
well
proceed
they
had
now
got
to
the
first
vault
in
which
stood
the
first
door
and
with
some
difficulty
they
opened
the
vault
door
it
has
not
been
opened
for
some
time
said
the
philosopher
i
dare
say
not
they
seldom
used
to
go
here
from
what
i
can
learn
though
it
is
kept
a
great
secret
and
we
can
keep
it
so
likewise
true
they
now
entered
the
vault
and
came
to
the
second
door
which
opened
into
a
kind
of
flight
of
steps
cut
out
of
the
solid
rock
and
then
along
a
passage
cut
out
of
the
mountain
of
some
kind
of
stone
but
not
so
hard
as
the
rock
itself
you
see
said
the
count
what
care
has
been
taken
to
isolate
the
place
and
detach
it
from
the
castle
so
that
it
should
not
be
dependent
upon
the
possessor
of
the
castle
this
is
the
last
door
but
one
and
now
prepare
yourself
for
a
surprise
doctor
this
will
be
an
extraordinary
one
so
saying
the
count
opened
the
door
and
stepped
on
one
side
when
the
doctor
approached
the
place
and
was
immediately
thrust
forward
by
the
count
and
he
rolled
down
some
steps
into
the
mine
and
was
immediately
seized
by
some
of
the
miners
who
had
been
stationed
there
for
that
purpose
and
carried
to
a
distant
part
of
the
mine
there
to
work
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
the
count
seeing
all
secure
refastened
the
doors
and
returned
to
the
castle
a
few
weeks
after
this
the
body
of
a
youth
mangled
and
disfigured
was
brought
to
the
castle
which
the
countess
said
was
her
son's
body
the
count
had
immediately
secured
the
real
heir
and
thrust
him
into
the
mines
there
to
pass
a
life
of
labour
and
hopeless
misery





there
was
a
high
feast
held
the
castle
gates
were
thrown
open
and
everybody
who
came
were
entertained
without
question
this
was
on
the
occasion
of
the
count's
and
countess's
marriage
it
seemed
many
months
after
the
death
of
her
son
whom
she
affected
to
mourn
for
a
long
time
however
the
marriage
took
place
and
in
all
magnificence
and
splendour
the
countess
again
appeared
arrayed
in
splendour
and
beauty
she
was
proud
and
haughty
and
the
count
was
imperious
in
the
mean
time
the
young
count
de
hugo
de
verole
was
confined
in
the
mines
and
the
doctor
with
him
by
a
strange
coincidence
the
doctor
and
the
young
count
became
companions
and
the
former
meditating
projects
of
revenge
educated
the
young
count
as
well
as
he
was
able
for
several
years
in
the
mines
and
cherished
in
the
young
man
a
spirit
of
revenge
they
finally
escaped
together
and
proceeded
to
leyden
where
the
doctor
had
friends
and
where
he
placed
his
pupil
at
the
university
and
thus
made
him
a
most
efficient
means
of
revenge
because
the
education
of
the
count
gave
him
a
means
of
appreciating
the
splendour
and
rank
he
had
been
deprived
of
he
therefore
determined
to
remain
at
leyden
until
he
was
of
age
and
then
apply
to
his
father's
friends
and
then
to
his
sovereign
to
dispossess
and
punish
them
both
for
their
double
crime
the
count
and
countess
lived
on
in
a
state
of
regal
splendour
the
immense
revenue
of
his
territory
and
the
treasure
the
late
count
had
amassed
as
well
as
the
revenue
that
the
mines
brought
in
would
have
supported
a
much
larger
expenditure
than
even
their
tastes
disposed
them
to
enjoy
they
had
heard
nothing
of
the
escape
of
the
doctor
and
the
young
count
indeed
those
who
knew
of
it
held
their
peace
and
said
nothing
about
it
for
they
feared
the
consequences
of
their
negligence
the
first
intimation
they
received
was
at
the
hands
of
a
state
messenger
summoning
them
to
deliver
up
the
castle
revenues
and
treasure
of
the
late
count
this
was
astounding
to
them
and
they
refused
to
do
so
but
were
soon
after
seized
upon
by
a
regiment
of
cuirassiers
sent
to
take
them
and
they
were
accused
of
the
crime
of
murder
at
the
instance
of
the
doctor
they
were
arraigned
and
found
guilty
and
as
they
were
of
the
patrician
order
their
execution
was
delayed
and
they
were
committed
to
exile
this
was
done
out
of
favour
to
the
young
count
who
did
not
wish
to
have
his
family
name
tainted
by
a
public
execution
or
their
being
confined
like
convicts
the
count
and
countess
quitted
hungary
and
settled
in
italy
where
they
lived
upon
the
remains
of
the
count
of
morven's
property
shorn
of
all
their
splendour
but
enough
to
keep
them
from
being
compelled
to
do
any
menial
office
the
young
count
took
possession
of
his
patrimony
and
his
treasure
at
last
such
as
was
left
by
his
mother
and
her
paramour
the
doctor
continued
to
hide
his
crime
from
the
young
count
and
the
perpetrators
denying
all
knowledge
of
it
he
escaped
but
he
returned
to
his
native
place
leyden
with
a
reward
for
his
services
from
the
young
count
flora
rose
from
her
perusal
of
the
manuscript
which
here
ended
and
even
as
she
did
so
she
heard
a
footstep
approaching
her
chamber
door
the
dreadful
mistake--the
terrific
interview
in
the
chamber--the
attack
of
the
vampyre
illustration
the
footstep
which
flora
upon
the
close
of
the
tale
she
had
been
reading
heard
approaching
her
apartment
came
rapidly
along
the
corridor
it
is
henry
returned
to
conduct
me
to
an
interview
with
charles's
uncle
she
said
i
wonder
now
what
manner
of
man
he
is
he
should
in
some
respects
resemble
charles
and
if
he
do
so
i
shall
bestow
upon
him
some
affection
for
that
alone
tap--tap
came
upon
the
chamber
door
flora
was
not
at
all
alarmed
now
as
she
had
been
when
henry
brought
her
the
manuscript
from
some
strange
action
of
the
nervous
system
she
felt
quite
confident
and
resolved
to
brave
everything
but
then
she
felt
quite
sure
that
it
was
henry
and
before
the
knocking
had
taken
her
by
surprise
come
in
she
said
in
a
cheerful
voice
come
in
the
door
opened
with
wonderful
swiftness--a
figure
stepped
into
the
room
and
then
closed
it
as
rapidly
and
stood
against
it
flora
tried
to
scream
but
her
tongue
refused
its
office
a
confused
whirl
of
sensations
passed
through
her
brain--she
trembled
and
an
icy
coldness
came
over
her
it
was
sir
francis
varney
the
vampyre
he
had
drawn
up
his
tall
gaunt
frame
to
its
full
height
and
crossed
his
arms
upon
his
breast
there
was
a
hideous
smile
upon
his
sallow
countenance
and
his
voice
was
deep
and
sepulchral
as
he
said--
flora
bannerworth
hear
that
which
i
have
to
say
and
hear
it
calmly
you
need
have
nothing
to
fear
make
an
alarm--scream
or
shout
for
help
and
by
the
hell
beneath
us
you
are
lost
there
was
a
death-like
cold
passionless
manner
about
the
utterance
of
these
words
as
if
they
were
spoken
mechanically
and
came
from
no
human
lips
flora
heard
them
and
yet
scarcely
comprehended
them
she
stepped
slowly
back
till
she
reached
a
chair
and
there
she
held
for
support
the
only
part
of
the
address
of
varney
that
thoroughly
reached
her
ears
was
that
if
she
gave
any
alarm
some
dreadful
consequences
were
to
ensue
but
it
was
not
on
account
of
these
words
that
she
really
gave
no
alarm
it
was
because
she
was
utterly
unable
to
do
so
answer
me
said
varney
promise
that
you
will
hear
that
which
i
have
to
say
in
so
promising
you
commit
yourself
to
no
evil
and
you
shall
hear
that
which
shall
give
you
much
peace
it
was
in
vain
she
tried
to
speak
her
lips
moved
but
she
uttered
no
sound
you
are
terrified
said
varney
and
yet
i
know
not
why
i
do
not
come
to
do
you
harm
although
harm
have
you
done
me
girl
i
come
to
rescue
you
from
a
thraldom
of
the
soul
under
which
you
now
labour
there
was
a
pause
of
some
moments'
duration
and
then
faintly
flora
managed
to
say--
help
help
oh
help
me
heaven
varney
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
as
he
said--
heaven
works
no
special
matters
now
flora
bannerworth
if
you
have
as
much
intellect
as
your
nobility
and
beauty
would
warrant
the
world
in
supposing
you
will
listen
to
me
i--i
hear
said
flora
as
she
still
dragging
the
chair
with
her
increased
the
distance
between
them
'tis
well
you
are
now
more
composed
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
face
of
varney
with
a
shudder
there
could
be
no
mistake
it
was
the
same
which
with
the
strange
glassy
looking
eyes
had
glared
upon
her
on
that
awful
night
of
the
storm
when
she
was
visited
by
the
vampyre
and
varney
returned
that
gaze
unflinchingly
there
was
a
hideous
and
strange
contortion
of
his
face
now
as
he
said--
you
are
beautiful
the
most
cunning
statuary
might
well
model
some
rare
work
of
art
from
those
rounded
limbs
that
were
surely
made
to
bewitch
the
gazer
your
skin
rivals
the
driven
snow--what
a
face
of
loveliness
and
what
a
form
of
enchantment
she
did
not
speak
but
a
thought
came
across
her
mind
which
at
once
crimsoned
her
cheek--she
knew
she
had
fainted
on
the
first
visit
of
the
vampyre
and
now
he
with
a
hideous
reverence
praised
beauties
which
he
might
have
cast
his
demoniac
eyes
over
at
such
a
time
you
understand
me
he
said
well
let
that
pass
i
am
something
allied
to
humanity
yet
speak
your
errand
gasped
flora
or
come
what
may
i
scream
for
help
to
those
who
will
not
be
slow
to
render
it
i
know
it
you
know
i
will
scream
no
you
will
hear
me
i
know
they
would
not
be
slow
to
tender
help
to
you
but
you
will
not
call
for
it
i
will
present
to
you
no
necessity
say
on--say
on
you
perceive
i
do
not
attempt
to
approach
you
my
errand
is
one
of
peace
peace
from
you
horrible
being
if
you
be
really
what
even
now
my
appalled
imagination
shrinks
from
naming
you
would
not
even
to
you
absolute
annihilation
be
a
blessing
peace
peace
i
came
not
here
to
talk
on
such
a
subject
i
must
be
brief
flora
bannerworth
for
time
presses
i
do
not
hate
you
wherefore
should
i
you
are
young
and
you
are
beautiful
and
you
bear
a
name
which
should
command
and
does
command
some
portion
of
my
best
regard
there
is
a
portrait
said
flora
in
this
house
no
more--no
more
i
know
what
you
would
say
it
is
yours
the
house
and
all
within
i
covet
he
said
uneasily
let
that
suffice
i
have
quarrelled
with
your
brother--i
have
quarrelled
with
one
who
just
now
fancies
he
loves
you
charles
holland
loves
me
truly
it
does
not
suit
me
now
to
dispute
that
point
with
you
i
have
the
means
of
knowing
more
of
the
secrets
of
the
human
heart
than
common
men
i
tell
you
flora
bannerworth
that
he
who
talks
to
you
of
love
loves
you
not
but
with
the
fleeting
fancy
of
a
boy
and
there
is
one
who
hides
deep
in
his
heart
a
world
of
passion
one
who
has
never
spoken
to
you
of
love
and
yet
who
loves
you
with
a
love
as
far
surpassing
the
evanescent
fancy
of
this
boy
holland
as
does
the
mighty
ocean
the
most
placid
lake
that
ever
basked
in
idleness
beneath
a
summer's
sun
there
was
a
wonderful
fascination
in
the
manner
now
of
varney
his
voice
sounded
like
music
itself
his
words
flowed
from
his
tongue
each
gently
and
properly
accented
with
all
the
charm
of
eloquence
despite
her
trembling
horror
of
that
man--despite
her
fearful
opinion
which
might
be
said
to
amount
to
a
conviction
of
what
he
really
was
flora
felt
an
irresistible
wish
to
hear
him
speak
on
ay
despite
too
the
ungrateful
theme
to
her
heart
which
he
had
now
chosen
as
the
subject
of
his
discourse
she
felt
her
fear
of
him
gradually
dissipating
and
now
when
he
made
a
pause
she
said--
you
are
much
mistaken
on
the
constancy
and
truth
of
charles
holland
i
would
stake
my
life
no
doubt
no
doubt
have
you
spoken
now
that
which
you
had
to
say
no
no
i
tell
you
i
covet
this
place
i
would
purchase
it
but
having
with
your
bad-tempered
brothers
quarrelled
they
will
hold
no
further
converse
with
me
and
well
they
may
refuse
be
that
as
it
may
sweet
lady
i
come
to
you
to
be
my
mediator
in
the
shadow
of
the
future
i
can
see
many
events
which
are
to
come
indeed
it
is
so
borrowing
some
wisdom
from
the
past
and
some
from
resources
i
would
not
detail
to
you
i
know
that
if
i
have
inflicted
much
misery
upon
you
i
can
spare
you
much
more
your
brother
or
your
lover
will
challenge
me
oh
no
no
i
say
such
will
happen
and
i
can
kill
either
my
skill
as
well
as
my
strength
is
superhuman
mercy
mercy
gasped
flora
i
will
spare
either
or
both
on
a
condition
what
fearful
condition
it
is
not
a
fearful
one
your
terrors
go
far
before
the
fact
all
i
wish
maiden
of
you
is
to
induce
these
imperious
brothers
of
yours
to
sell
or
let
the
hall
to
me
is
that
all
it
is
i
ask
no
more
and
in
return
i
promise
you
not
only
that
i
will
not
fight
with
them
but
that
you
shall
never
see
me
again
rest
securely
maiden
you
will
be
undisturbed
by
me
oh
god
that
were
indeed
an
assurance
worth
the
striving
for
said
flora
it
is
one
you
may
have
but--
oh
i
knew--my
heart
told
me
there
was
yet
some
fearful
condition
to
come
you
are
wrong
again
i
only
ask
of
you
that
you
keep
this
meeting
a
secret
no
no
no--i
cannot
nay
what
so
easy
i
will
not
i
have
no
secrets
from
those
i
love
indeed
you
will
find
soon
the
expediency
of
a
few
at
least
but
if
you
will
not
i
cannot
urge
it
longer
do
as
your
wayward
woman's
nature
prompts
you
there
was
a
slight
but
a
very
slight
tone
of
aggravation
in
these
words
and
the
manner
in
which
they
were
uttered
as
he
spoke
he
moved
from
the
door
towards
the
window
which
opened
into
a
kitchen
garden
flora
shrunk
as
far
from
him
as
possible
and
for
a
few
moments
they
regarded
each
other
in
silence
young
blood
said
varney
mantles
in
your
veins
she
shuddered
with
terror
be
mindful
of
the
condition
i
have
proposed
to
you
i
covet
bannerworth
hall
i--i
hear
and
i
must
have
it
i
will
have
it
although
my
path
to
it
be
through
a
sea
of
blood
you
understand
me
maiden
repeat
what
has
passed
between
us
or
not
as
you
please
i
say
beware
of
me
if
you
keep
not
the
condition
i
have
proposed
heaven
knows
that
this
place
is
becoming
daily
more
hateful
to
us
all
said
flora
indeed
you
well
might
know
so
much
it
is
no
sacrifice
to
urge
it
now
i
will
urge
my
brother
thanks--a
thousand
thanks
you
may
not
live
to
regret
even
having
made
a
friend
of
varney--
the
vampyre
said
flora
he
advanced
towards
her
a
step
and
she
involuntarily
uttered
a
scream
of
terror
in
an
instant
his
hand
clasped
her
waist
with
the
power
of
an
iron
vice
she
felt
hit
hot
breath
flushing
on
her
cheek
her
senses
reeled
and
she
found
herself
sinking
she
gathered
all
her
breath
and
all
her
energies
into
one
piercing
shriek
and
then
she
fell
to
the
floor
there
was
a
sudden
crash
of
broken
glass
and
then
all
was
still
the
conference
between
the
uncle
and
nephew
and
the
alarm
illustration
meanwhile
charles
holland
had
taken
his
uncle
by
the
arm
and
led
him
into
a
private
room
dear
uncle
he
said
be
seated
and
i
will
explain
everything
without
reserve
seated--nonsense
i'll
walk
about
said
the
admiral
d--n
me
i've
no
patience
to
be
seated
and
very
seldom
had
or
have
go
on
now
you
young
scamp
well--well
you
abuse
me
but
i
am
quite
sure
had
you
been
in
my
situation
you
would
have
acted
precisely
as
i
have
done
no
i
shouldn't
well
but
uncle--
don't
think
to
come
over
me
by
calling
me
uncle
hark
you
charles--from
this
moment
i
won't
be
your
uncle
any
more
very
well
sir
it
ain't
very
well
and
how
dare
you
you
buccaneer
call
me
sir
eh
i
say
how
dare
you
i
will
call
you
anything
you
like
but
i
won't
be
called
anything
i
like
you
might
as
well
call
me
at
once
morgan
the
pirate
for
he
was
called
anything
he
liked
hilloa
sir
how
dare
you
laugh
eh
i'll
teach
you
to
laugh
at
me
i
wish
i
had
you
on
board
ship--that's
all
you
young
rascal
i'd
soon
teach
you
to
laugh
at
your
superior
officer
i
would
oh
uncle
i
did
not
laugh
at
you
what
did
you
laugh
at
then
at
the
joke
joke
d--n
me
there
was
no
joke
at
all
oh
very
good
and
it
ain't
very
good
charles
knew
very
well
that
this
sort
of
humour
in
which
was
the
old
admiral
would
soon
pass
away
and
then
that
he
would
listen
to
him
comfortably
enough
so
he
would
not
allow
the
least
exhibition
of
petulance
or
mere
impatience
to
escape
himself
but
contented
himself
by
waiting
until
the
ebullition
of
feeling
fairly
worked
itself
out
well
well
at
length
said
the
old
man
you
have
dragged
me
here
into
a
very
small
and
a
very
dull
room
under
pretence
of
having
something
to
tell
me
and
i
have
heard
nothing
yet
then
i
will
now
tell
you
said
charles
i
fell
in
love--
bah
with
flora
bannerworth
abroad
she
is
not
only
the
most
beautiful
of
created
beings--
bah
but
her
mind
is
of
the
highest
order
of
intelligence
honour
candour
and
all
amiable
feelings--
bah
really
uncle
if
you
say
'bah'
to
everything
i
cannot
go
on
and
what
the
deuce
difference
sir
does
it
make
to
you
whether
i
say
'bah'
or
not
well
i
love
her
she
came
to
england
and
as
i
could
not
exist
but
was
getting
ill
and
should
no
doubt
have
died
if
i
had
not
done
so
i
came
to
england
but
d----e
i
want
to
know
about
the
mermaid
the
vampyre
you
mean
sir
well
well
the
vampyre
then
uncle
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
it
is
supposed
a
vampyre
came
one
night
and
inflicted
a
wound
upon
flora's
neck
with
his
teeth
and
that
he
is
still
endeavouring
to
renew
his
horrible
existence
from
the
young
pure
blood
that
flows
through
her
veins
the
devil
he
is
yes
i
am
bewildered
i
must
confess
by
the
mass
of
circumstances
that
have
combined
to
give
the
affair
a
horrible
truthfulness
poor
flora
is
much
injured
in
health
and
spirits
and
when
i
came
home
she
at
once
implored
me
to
give
her
up
and
think
of
her
no
more
for
she
could
not
think
of
allowing
me
to
unite
my
fate
with
hers
under
such
circumstances
she
did
such
were
her
words
uncle
she
implored
me--she
used
that
word
'implore'--to
fly
from
her
to
leave
her
to
her
fate
to
endeavour
to
find
happiness
with
some
one
else
well
but
i
saw
her
heart
was
breaking
what
o'
that
much
of
that
uncle
i
told
her
that
when
i
deserted
her
in
the
hour
of
misfortune
that
i
hoped
heaven
would
desert
me
i
told
her
that
if
her
happiness
was
wrecked
to
cling
yet
to
me
and
that
with
what
power
and
what
strength
god
had
given
me
i
would
stand
between
her
and
all
ill
and
what
then
she--she
fell
upon
my
breast
and
wept
and
blessed
me
could
i
desert
her--could
i
say
to
her
'my
dear
girl
when
you
were
full
of
health
and
beauty
i
loved
you
but
now
that
sadness
is
at
your
heart
i
leave
you'
could
i
tell
her
that
uncle
and
yet
call
myself
a
man
no
roared
the
old
admiral
in
a
voice
that
made
the
room
echo
again
and
i
tell
you
what
if
you
had
done
so
d--n
you
you
puppy
i'd
have
braced
you
and--and
married
the
girl
myself
i
would
d----e
but
i
would
dear
uncle
don't
dear
me
sir
talk
of
deserting
a
girl
when
the
signal
of
distress
in
the
shape
of
a
tear
is
in
her
eye
but
i--
you
are
a
wretch--a
confounded
lubberly
boy--a
swab--a
d----d
bad
grampus
you
mistake
uncle
no
i
don't
god
bless
you
charles
you
shall
have
her--if
a
whole
ship's
crew
of
vampyres
said
no
you
shall
have
her
let
me
see
her--just
let
me
see
her
the
admiral
gave
his
lips
a
vigorous
wipe
with
his
sleeve
and
charles
said
hastily--
my
dear
uncle
you
will
recollect
that
miss
bannerworth
is
quite
a
young
lady
i
suppose
she
is
well
then
for
god's
sake
don't
attempt
to
kiss
her
not
kiss
her
d----e
they
like
it
not
kiss
her
because
she's
a
young
lady
d----e
do
you
think
i'd
kiss
a
corporal
of
marines
no
uncle
but
you
know
young
ladies
are
very
delicate
and
ain't
i
delicate--shiver
my
timbers
ain't
i
delicate
where
is
she
that's
what
i
want
to
know
then
you
approve
of
what
i
have
done
you
are
a
young
scamp
but
you
have
got
some
of
the
old
admiral's
family
blood
in
you
so
don't
take
any
credit
for
acting
like
an
honest
man--you
couldn't
help
it
but
if
i
had
not
so
acted
said
charles
with
a
smile
what
would
have
become
of
the
family
blood
then
what's
that
to
you
i
would
have
disowned
you
because
that
very
thing
would
have
convinced
me
you
were
an
impostor
and
did
not
belong
to
the
family
at
all
well
that
would
have
been
one
way
of
getting
over
the
difficulty
no
difficulty
at
all
the
man
who
deserts
the
good
ship
that
carries
him
through
the
waves
or
the
girl
that
trusts
her
heart
to
him
ought
to
be
chopped
up
into
meat
for
wild
monkeys
well
i
think
so
to
of
course
you
do
why
of
course
because
it's
so
d----d
reasonable
that
being
a
nephew
of
mine
you
can't
possibly
help
it
bravo
uncle
i
had
no
idea
you
were
so
argumentative
hadn't
you
spooney
you'd
be
an
ornament
to
the
gun-room
you
would
but
where's
the
'young
lady'
who
is
so
infernal
delicate--where
is
she
i
say
i
will
fetch
her
uncle
ah
do
i'll
be
bound
now
she's
one
of
the
right
build--a
good
figure-head
and
don't
make
too
much
stern-way
illustration
well
well
whatever
you
do
now
don't
pay
her
any
compliments
for
your
efforts
in
that
line
are
of
such
a
very
doubtful
order
that
i
shall
dread
to
hear
you
you
be
off
and
mind
your
own
business
i
haven't
been
at
sea
forty
years
without
picking
up
some
out-and-out
delicate
compliments
to
say
to
a
young
lady
but
do
you
really
imagine
now
that
the
deck
of
a
man-of-war
is
a
nice
place
to
pick
up
courtly
compliments
in
of
course
i
do
there
you
hear
the
best
of
language
d----e
you
don't
know
what
you
are
talking
about
you
fellows
that
have
stuck
on
shore
all
your
lives
it's
we
seamen
who
learn
life
well
well--hark
what's
that
a
cry--did
you
not
hear
a
cry
a
signal
of
distress
by
g--d
in
their
efforts
to
leave
the
room
the
uncle
and
nephew
for
about
a
minute
actually
blocked
up
the
door-way
but
the
superior
bulk
of
the
admiral
prevailed
and
after
nearly
squeezing
poor
charles
flat
he
got
out
first
but
this
did
not
avail
him
for
he
knew
not
where
to
go
now
the
second
scream
which
flora
had
uttered
when
the
vampyre
had
clasped
her
waist
came
upon
their
ears
and
as
they
were
outside
the
room
it
acted
well
as
a
guide
in
which
direction
to
come
charles
fancied
correctly
enough
at
once
that
it
proceeded
from
the
room
which
was
called
flora's
own
room
and
thitherward
accordingly
he
dashed
at
tremendous
speed
henry
however
happened
to
be
nearer
at
hand
and
moreover
he
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
because
he
knew
that
flora
was
in
her
own
room
so
he
reached
it
first
and
charles
saw
him
rush
in
a
few
moments
before
he
could
reach
the
room
the
difference
of
time
however
was
very
slight
and
henry
had
only
just
raised
flora
from
the
floor
as
charles
appeared
god
of
heaven
cried
the
latter
what
has
happened
i
know
not
said
henry
as
god
is
my
judge
i
know
not
flora
flora
speak
to
us
flora
flora
she
has
fainted
cried
charles
some
water
may
restore
her
oh
henry
henry
is
not
this
horrible
courage
courage
said
henry
although
his
voice
betrayed
what
a
terrible
state
of
anxiety
he
was
himself
in
you
will
find
water
in
that
decanter
charles
here
is
my
mother
too
another
visit
god
help
us
mrs
bannerworth
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
sofa
which
was
in
the
room
and
could
only
wring
her
hands
and
weep
avast
cried
the
admiral
making
his
appearance
where's
the
enemy
lads
uncle
said
charles
uncle
uncle
the
vampyre
has
been
here
again--the
dreadful
vampyre
d--n
me
and
he's
gone
too
and
carried
half
the
window
with
him
look
there
it
was
literally
true
the
window
which
was
a
long
latticed
one
was
smashed
through
help
oh
help
said
flora
as
the
water
that
was
dashed
in
her
face
began
to
recover
her
you
are
safe
cried
henry
you
are
safe
flora
said
charles
you
know
my
voice
dear
flora
look
up
and
you
will
see
there
are
none
here
but
those
who
love
you
flora
opened
her
eyes
timidly
as
the
said--
has
it
gone
yes
yes
dear
said
charles
look
around
you
here
are
none
but
true
friends
and
tried
friends
my
dear
said
admiral
bell
excepting
me
and
whenever
you
like
to
try
me
afloat
or
ashore
d--n
me
shew
me
old
nick
himself
and
i
won't
shrink--yard
arm
and
yard
arm--grapnel
to
grapnel--pitch
pots
and
grenades
this
is
my
uncle
flora
said
charles
i
thank
you
sir
said
flora
faintly
all
right
whispered
the
admiral
to
charles
what
a
figure-head
to
be
sure
poll
at
swansea
would
have
made
just
about
four
of
her
but
she
wasn't
so
delicate
d--n
me
i
should
think
not
you
are
right
for
once
in
a
way
charley
what
was
it
that
alarmed
you
said
charles
tenderly
as
he
now
took
one
of
flora's
hands
in
his
varney--varney
the
vampyre
varney
exclaimed
henry
varney
here
yes
he
came
in
at
that
door
and
when
i
screamed
i
suppose--for
i
hardly
was
conscious--he
darted
out
through
the
window
this
said
henry
is
beyond
all
human
patience
by
heaven
i
cannot
and
will
not
endure
it
it
shall
be
my
quarrel
said
charles
i
shall
go
at
once
and
defy
him
he
shall
meet
me
oh
no
no
no
said
flora
as
she
clung
convulsively
to
charles
no
no
there
is
a
better
way
what
way
the
place
has
become
full
of
terrors
let
us
leave
it
let
him
as
he
wishes
have
it
let
him
have
it
yes
yes
god
knows
if
it
purchase
an
immunity
from
these
visits
we
may
well
be
overjoyed
remember
that
we
have
ample
reason
to
believe
him
more
than
human
why
should
you
allow
yourselves
to
risk
a
personal
encounter
with
such
a
man
who
might
be
glad
to
kill
you
that
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
replenishing
his
own
hideous
existence
from
your
best
heart's
blood
the
young
men
looked
aghast
besides
added
flora
you
cannot
tell
what
dreadful
powers
of
mischief
he
may
have
against
which
human
courage
might
be
of
no
avail
there
is
truth
and
reason
said
mr
marchdale
stepping
forward
in
what
flora
says
only
let
me
come
across
him
that's
all
said
admiral
bell
and
i'll
soon
find
out
what
he
is
i
suppose
he's
some
long
slab
of
a
lubber
after
all
ain't
he
with
no
strength
his
strength
is
immense
said
marchdale
i
tried
to
seize
him
and
i
fell
beneath
his
arm
as
if
i
had
been
struck
by
the
hammer
of
a
cyclops
a
what
cried
the
admiral
a
cyclops
d--n
me
i
served
aboard
the
cyclops
eleven
years
and
never
saw
a
very
big
hammer
aboard
of
her
what
on
earth
is
to
be
done
said
henry
oh
chimed
in
the
admiral
there's
always
a
bother
about
what's
to
be
done
on
earth
now
at
sea
i
could
soon
tell
you
what
was
to
be
done
we
must
hold
a
solemn
consultation
over
this
matter
said
henry
you
are
safe
now
flora
oh
be
ruled
by
me
give
up
the
hall
you
tremble
i
do
tremble
brother
for
what
may
yet
ensue
i
implore
you
to
give
up
the
hall
it
is
but
a
terror
to
us
now--give
it
up
have
no
more
to
do
with
it
let
us
make
terms
with
sir
francis
varney
remember
we
dare
not
kill
him
he
ought
to
be
smothered
said
the
admiral
it
is
true
remarked
henry
we
dare
not
even
holding
all
the
terrible
suspicions
we
do
take
his
life
by
foul
means
certainly
not
said
charles
were
he
ten
times
a
vampyre
i
cannot
however
believe
that
he
is
so
invulnerable
as
he
is
represented
no
one
represents
him
here
said
marchdale
i
speak
sir
because
i
saw
you
glance
at
me
i
only
know
that
having
made
two
unsuccessful
attempts
to
seize
him
he
eluded
me
once
by
leaving
in
my
grasp
a
piece
of
his
coat
and
the
next
time
he
struck
me
down
and
i
feel
yet
the
effects
of
the
terrific
blow
you
hear
said
flora
yes
i
hear
said
charles
for
some
reason
added
marchdale
in
a
tone
of
emotion
what
i
say
seems
to
fall
always
badly
upon
mr
holland's
ear
i
know
not
why
but
if
it
will
give
him
any
satisfaction
i
will
leave
bannerworth
hall
to-night
no
no
no
said
henry
for
the
love
of
heaven
do
not
let
us
quarrel
hear
hear
cried
the
admiral
we
can
never
fight
the
enemy
well
if
the
ship's
crew
are
on
bad
terms
come
now
you
charles
this
appears
to
be
an
honest
gentlemanly
fellow--give
him
your
hand
if
mr
charles
holland
said
marchdale
knows
aught
to
my
prejudice
in
any
way
however
slight
i
here
beg
of
him
to
declare
it
at
once
and
openly
i
cannot
assert
that
i
do
said
charles
then
what
the
deuce
do
you
make
yourself
so
disagreeable
for
eh
cried
the
admiral
one
cannot
help
one's
impression
and
feelings
said
charles
but
i
am
willing
to
take
mr
marchdale's
hand
and
i
yours
young
sir
said
marchdale
in
all
sincerity
of
spirit
and
with
good
will
towards
you
they
shook
hands
but
it
required
no
conjuror
to
perceive
that
it
was
not
done
willingly
or
cordially
it
was
a
handshaking
of
that
character
which
seemed
to
imply
on
each
side
i
don't
like
you
but
i
don't
know
positively
any
harm
of
you
there
now
said
the
admiral
that's
better
now
let
us
hold
counsel
about
this
varney
said
henry
come
to
the
parlour
all
of
you
and
we
will
endeavour
to
come
to
some
decided
arrangement
do
not
weep
mother
said
flora
all
may
yet
be
well
we
will
leave
this
place
we
will
consider
that
question
flora
said
henry
and
believe
me
your
wishes
will
go
a
long
way
with
all
of
us
as
you
may
well
suppose
they
always
would
they
left
mrs
bannerworth
with
flora
and
proceeded
to
the
small
oaken
parlour
in
which
were
the
elaborate
and
beautiful
carvings
which
have
been
before
mentioned
henry's
countenance
perhaps
wore
the
most
determined
expression
of
all
he
appeared
now
as
if
he
had
thoroughly
made
up
his
mind
to
do
something
which
should
have
a
decided
tendency
to
put
a
stop
to
the
terrible
scenes
which
were
now
day
by
day
taking
place
beneath
that
roof
charles
holland
looked
serious
and
thoughtful
as
if
he
were
revolving
some
course
of
action
in
his
mind
concerning
which
he
was
not
quite
clear
mr
marchdale
was
more
sad
and
depressed
to
all
appearance
than
any
of
them
as
for
the
admiral
he
was
evidently
in
a
state
of
amazement
and
knew
not
what
to
think
he
was
anxious
to
do
something
and
yet
what
that
was
to
be
he
had
not
the
most
remote
idea
any
more
than
as
if
he
was
not
at
all
cognisant
of
any
of
those
circumstances
every
one
of
which
was
so
completely
out
of
the
line
of
his
former
life
and
experience
george
had
gone
to
call
on
mr
chillingworth
so
he
was
not
present
at
the
first
part
of
this
serious
council
of
war
the
consultation--the
determination
to
leave
the
hall
illustration
this
was
certainly
the
most
seriously
reasonable
meeting
which
had
been
held
at
bannerworth
hall
on
the
subject
of
the
much
dreaded
vampyre
the
absolute
necessity
for
doing
something
of
a
decisive
character
was
abundantly
apparent
and
when
henry
promised
flora
that
her
earnest
wish
to
leave
the
house
should
not
be
forgotten
as
an
element
in
the
discussion
which
was
about
to
ensue
it
was
with
a
rapidly
growing
feeling
on
his
own
part
to
the
effect
that
that
house
associated
even
as
it
was
with
many
endearing
recollections
was
no
home
for
him
hence
he
was
the
more
inclined
to
propose
a
departure
from
the
hall
if
it
could
possibly
be
arranged
satisfactorily
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
the
pecuniary
point
of
view
however
in
which
henry
was
compelled
to
look
at
the
subject
was
an
important
and
a
troublesome
one
we
have
already
hinted
at
the
very
peculiar
state
of
the
finances
of
the
family
and
in
fact
although
the
income
derivable
from
various
sources
ought
to
have
been
amply
sufficient
to
provide
henry
and
those
who
were
dependent
upon
him
with
a
respectable
livelihood
yet
it
was
nearly
all
swallowed
up
by
the
payment
of
regular
instalments
upon
family
debts
incurred
by
his
father
and
the
creditors
took
great
credit
to
themselves
that
they
allowed
of
such
an
arrangement
instead
of
sweeping
off
all
before
them
and
leaving
the
family
to
starve
the
question
therefore
or
at
all
events
one
of
the
questions
now
was
how
far
would
a
departure
from
the
hall
of
him
henry
and
the
other
branches
of
the
family
act
upon
that
arrangement
during
a
very
few
minutes'
consideration
henry
with
the
frank
and
candid
disposition
which
was
so
strong
a
characteristic
of
his
character
made
up
his
mind
to
explain
all
this
fully
to
charles
holland
and
his
uncle
when
once
he
formed
such
a
determination
he
was
not
likely
to
be
slow
in
carrying
it
into
effect
and
no
sooner
then
were
the
whole
of
them
seated
in
the
small
oaken
parlour
than
he
made
an
explicit
statement
of
his
circumstances
but
said
mr
marchdale
when
he
had
done
i
cannot
see
what
right
your
creditors
have
to
complain
of
where
you
live
so
long
as
you
perform
your
contract
to
them
true
but
they
always
expected
me
i
knew
to
remain
at
the
hall
and
if
they
chose
why
of
course
at
any
time
they
could
sell
off
the
whole
property
for
what
it
would
fetch
and
pay
themselves
as
far
as
the
proceeds
would
go
at
all
events
i
am
quite
certain
there
could
be
nothing
at
all
left
for
me
i
cannot
imagine
added
mr
marchdale
that
any
men
could
be
so
unreasonable
it
is
scarcely
to
be
borne
remarked
charles
holland
with
more
impatience
than
he
usually
displayed
that
a
whole
family
are
to
be
put
to
the
necessity
of
leaving
their
home
for
no
other
reason
than
the
being
pestered
by
such
a
neighbour
as
sir
francis
varney
it
makes
one
impatient
and
angry
to
reflect
upon
such
a
state
of
things
and
yet
they
are
lamentably
true
said
henry
what
can
we
do
surely
there
must
be
some
sort
of
remedy
there
is
but
one
that
i
can
imagine
and
that
is
one
we
all
alike
revolt
from
we
might
kill
him
that
is
out
of
the
question
of
course
my
impression
is
that
he
bears
the
same
name
really
as
myself
and
that
he
is
my
ancestor
from
whom
was
painted
the
portrait
on
the
panel
have
circumstances
really
so
far
pressed
upon
you
said
charles
holland
as
at
length
to
convince
you
that
this
man
is
really
the
horrible
creature
we
surmise
he
may
be
dare
we
longer
doubt
it
cried
henry
in
a
tone
of
excitement
he
is
the
vampyre
i'll
be
hanged
if
i
believe
it
said
admiral
bell
stuff
and
nonsense
vampyre
indeed
bother
the
vampyre
sir
said
henry
you
have
not
had
brought
before
you
painfully
as
we
have
all
the
circumstances
upon
which
we
in
a
manner
feel
compelled
to
found
this
horrible
belief
at
first
incredulity
was
a
natural
thing
we
had
no
idea
that
ever
we
could
be
brought
to
believe
in
such
a
thing
that
is
the
case
added
marchdale
but
step
by
step
we
have
been
driven
from
utter
disbelief
in
this
phenomenon
to
a
trembling
conviction
that
it
must
be
true
unless
we
admit
that
simultaneously
the
senses
of
a
number
of
persons
have
been
deceived
that
is
scarcely
possible
then
do
you
mean
really
to
say
there
are
such
fish
said
the
admiral
we
think
so
well
i'm
d----d
i
have
heard
all
sorts
of
yarns
about
what
fellows
have
seen
in
one
ocean
and
another
but
this
does
beat
them
all
to
nothing
it
is
monstrous
exclaimed
charles
there
was
a
pause
of
some
few
moments'
duration
and
then
mr
marchdale
said
in
a
low
voice--
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
propose
any
course
of
action
until
you
henry
have
yourself
done
so
but
even
at
the
risk
of
being
presumptuous
i
will
say
that
i
am
firmly
of
opinion
you
ought
to
leave
the
hall
i
am
inclined
to
think
so
too
said
henry
but
the
creditors
interposed
charles
i
think
they
might
be
consulted
on
the
matter
beforehand
added
marchdale
when
no
doubt
they
would
acquiesce
in
an
arrangement
which
could
do
them
no
harm
certainly
no
harm
said
henry
for
i
cannot
take
the
estate
with
me
as
they
well
know
precisely
if
you
do
not
like
to
sell
it
you
can
let
it
to
whom
why
under
the
existing
circumstances
it
is
not
likely
you
would
get
any
tenant
for
it
than
the
one
who
has
offered
himself
sir
francis
varney
yes
it
seems
to
be
a
great
object
with
him
to
live
here
and
it
appears
to
me
that
notwithstanding
all
that
has
occurred
it
is
most
decidedly
the
best
policy
to
let
him
nobody
could
really
deny
the
reasonableness
of
this
advice
although
it
seemed
strange
and
was
repugnant
to
the
feelings
of
them
all
as
they
heard
it
there
was
a
pause
of
some
seconds'
duration
and
then
henry
said--
it
does
indeed
seem
singular
to
surrender
one's
house
to
such
a
being
especially
said
charles
after
what
has
occurred
true
well
said
mr
marchdale
if
any
better
plan
of
proceeding
taking
the
whole
case
into
consideration
can
be
devised
i
shall
be
most
happy
will
you
consent
to
put
off
all
proceedings
for
three
days
said
charles
holland
suddenly
have
you
any
plan
my
dear
sir
said
mr
marchdale
i
have
but
it
is
one
which
i
would
rather
say
nothing
about
for
the
present
i
have
no
objection
said
henry
i
do
not
know
that
three
days
can
make
any
difference
in
the
state
of
affairs
let
it
be
so
if
you
wish
charles
then
i
am
satisfied
said
charles
i
cannot
but
feel
that
situated
as
i
am
regarding
flora
this
is
almost
more
my
affair
than
even
yours
henry
i
cannot
see
that
said
henry
why
should
you
take
upon
yourself
more
of
the
responsibility
of
these
affairs
than
i
charles
you
induce
in
my
mind
a
suspicion
that
you
have
some
desperate
project
in
your
imagination
which
by
such
a
proposition
you
would
seek
to
reconcile
me
to
charles
was
silent
and
henry
then
added--
now
charles
i
am
quite
convinced
that
what
i
have
hinted
at
is
the
fact
you
have
conceived
some
scheme
which
you
fancy
would
be
much
opposed
by
us
i
will
not
deny
that
i
have
said
charles
it
is
one
however
which
you
must
allow
me
for
the
present
to
keep
locked
in
my
own
breast
why
will
you
not
trust
us
for
two
reasons
indeed
the
one
is
that
i
have
not
yet
thoroughly
determined
upon
the
course
i
project
and
the
other
is
that
it
is
one
in
which
i
am
not
justified
in
involving
any
one
else
charles
charles
said
henry
despondingly
only
consider
for
a
moment
into
what
new
misery
you
may
plunge
poor
flora
who
is
heaven
knows
already
sufficiently
afflicted
by
attempting
an
enterprise
which
even
we
who
are
your
friends
may
unwittingly
cross
you
in
the
performance
of
this
is
one
in
which
i
fear
no
such
result
it
cannot
so
happen
do
not
urge
me
can't
you
say
at
once
what
you
think
of
doing
said
the
old
admiral
what
do
you
mean
by
turning
your
sails
in
all
sorts
of
directions
so
oddly
you
sneak
why
don't
you
be
what
do
you
call
it--explicit
i
cannot
uncle
what
are
you
tongue-tied
all
here
know
well
said
charles
that
if
i
do
not
unfold
my
mind
fully
it
is
not
that
i
fear
to
trust
any
one
present
but
from
some
other
most
special
reason
charles
i
forbear
to
urge
you
further
said
henry
and
only
implore
you
to
be
careful
at
this
moment
the
room
door
opened
and
george
bannerworth
accompanied
by
mr
chillingworth
came
in
do
not
let
me
intrude
said
the
surgeon
i
fear
as
i
see
you
seated
gentlemen
that
my
presence
must
be
a
rudeness
and
a
disturbance
to
some
family
consultation
among
yourselves
not
at
all
mr
chillingworth
said
henry
pray
be
seated
we
are
very
glad
indeed
to
see
you
admiral
bell
this
is
a
friend
on
whom
we
can
rely--mr
chillingworth
and
one
of
the
right
sort
i
can
see
said
the
admiral
as
he
shook
mr
chillingworth
by
the
hand
sir
you
do
me
much
honour
said
the
doctor
none
at
all
none
at
all
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
this
infernal
odd
vampyre
business
i
believe
i
do
sir
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
think
time
will
develop
the
circumstances
sufficiently
to
convince
us
all
that
such
things
cannot
be
d--n
me
you
are
the
most
sensible
fellow
then
that
i
have
yet
met
with
since
i
have
been
in
this
neighbourhood
for
everybody
else
is
so
convinced
about
the
vampyre
that
they
are
ready
to
swear
by
him
it
would
take
much
more
to
convince
me
i
was
coming
over
here
when
i
met
mr
george
bannerworth
coming
to
my
house
yes
said
george
and
mr
chillingworth
has
something
to
tell
us
of
a
nature
confirmatory
of
our
own
suspicions
it
is
strange
said
henry
but
any
piece
of
news
come
it
from
what
quarter
it
may
seems
to
be
confirmatory
in
some
degree
or
another
of
that
dreadful
belief
in
vampyres
why
said
the
doctor
when
mr
george
says
that
my
news
is
of
such
a
character
i
think
he
goes
a
little
too
far
what
i
have
to
tell
you
i
do
not
conceive
has
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
fact
or
one
fact
of
there
being
vampyres
let
us
hear
it
said
henry
it
is
simply
this
that
i
was
sent
for
by
sir
francis
varney
myself
you
sent
for
yes
he
sent
for
me
by
a
special
messenger
to
come
to
him
and
when
i
went
which
under
the
circumstances
you
may
well
guess
i
did
with
all
the
celerity
possible
i
found
it
was
to
consult
me
about
a
flesh
wound
in
his
arm
which
was
showing
some
angry
symptoms
indeed
yes
it
was
so
when
i
was
introduced
to
him
i
found
him
lying
on
a
couch
and
looking
pale
and
unwell
in
the
most
respectful
manner
he
asked
me
to
be
seated
and
when
i
had
taken
a
chair
he
added--
'mr
chillingworth
i
have
sent
for
you
in
consequence
of
a
slight
accident
which
has
happened
to
my
arm
i
was
incautiously
loading
some
fire-arms
and
discharged
a
pistol
so
close
to
me
that
the
bullet
inflicted
a
wound
on
my
arm'
'if
you
will
allow
me
said
i
'to
see
the
wound
i
will
give
you
my
opinion'
he
then
showed
me
a
jagged
wound
which
had
evidently
been
caused
by
the
passage
of
a
bullet
which
had
it
gone
a
little
deeper
must
have
inflicted
serious
injury
as
it
was
the
wound
was
but
trifling
he
had
evidently
been
attempting
to
dress
it
himself
but
finding
some
considerable
inflammation
he
very
likely
got
a
little
alarmed
you
dressed
the
wound
i
did
and
what
do
you
think
of
sir
francis
varney
now
that
you
have
had
so
capital
an
opportunity
said
henry
of
a
close
examination
of
him
why
there
is
certainly
something
odd
about
him
which
i
cannot
well
define
but
take
him
altogether
he
can
be
a
very
gentlemanly
man
indeed
so
he
can
his
manners
are
easy
and
polished
he
has
evidently
mixed
in
good
society
and
i
never
in
all
my
life
heard
such
a
sweet
soft
winning
voice
that
is
strictly
him
you
noticed
i
presume
his
great
likeness
to
the
portrait
on
the
panel
i
did
at
some
moments
and
viewing
his
face
in
some
particular
lights
it
showed
much
more
strongly
than
at
others
my
impression
was
that
he
could
when
he
liked
look
much
more
like
the
portrait
on
the
panel
than
when
he
allowed
his
face
to
assume
its
ordinary
appearance
probably
such
an
impression
would
be
produced
upon
your
mind
said
charles
by
some
accidental
expression
of
the
countenance
which
even
he
was
not
aware
of
and
which
often
occurs
in
families
it
may
be
so
of
course
you
did
not
hint
sir
at
what
has
passed
here
with
regard
to
him
said
henry
i
did
not
being
you
see
called
in
professionally
i
had
no
right
to
take
advantage
of
that
circumstance
to
make
any
remarks
to
him
about
his
private
affairs
certainly
not
it
was
all
one
to
me
whether
he
was
a
vampyre
or
not
professionally
and
however
deeply
i
might
feel
personally
interested
in
the
matter
i
said
nothing
to
him
about
it
because
you
see
if
i
had
he
would
have
had
a
fair
opportunity
of
saying
at
once
'pray
sir
what
is
that
to
you'
and
i
should
have
been
at
a
loss
what
to
reply
can
we
doubt
said
henry
but
that
this
very
wound
has
been
inflicted
upon
sir
francis
varney
by
the
pistol-bullet
which
was
discharged
at
him
by
flora
everything
leads
to
such
an
assumption
certainly
said
charles
holland
and
yet
you
cannot
even
deduce
from
that
the
absolute
fact
of
sir
francis
varney
being
a
vampyre
i
do
not
think
mr
chillingworth
said
marchdale
anything
would
convince
you
but
a
visit
from
him
and
an
actual
attempt
to
fasten
upon
some
of
your
own
veins
that
would
not
convince
me
said
chillingworth
then
you
will
not
be
convinced
i
certainly
will
not
i
mean
to
hold
out
to
the
last
i
said
at
the
first
and
i
say
so
still
that
i
never
will
give
way
to
this
most
outrageous
superstition
i
wish
i
could
think
with
you
said
marchdale
with
a
shudder
but
there
may
be
something
in
the
very
atmosphere
of
this
house
which
has
been
rendered
hideous
by
the
awful
visits
that
have
been
made
to
it
which
forbids
me
to
disbelieve
in
those
things
which
others
more
happily
situated
can
hold
at
arm's
length
and
utterly
repudiate
there
may
be
said
henry
but
as
to
that
i
think
after
the
very
strongly
expressed
wish
of
flora
i
will
decide
upon
leaving
the
house
will
you
sell
it
or
let
it
the
latter
i
should
much
prefer
was
the
reply
but
who
will
take
it
now
except
sir
francis
varney
why
not
at
once
let
him
have
it
i
am
well
aware
that
this
does
sound
odd
advice
but
remember
we
are
all
the
creatures
of
circumstances
and
that
in
some
cases
where
we
least
like
it
we
must
swim
with
the
stream
that
you
will
not
decide
upon
however
at
present
said
charles
holland
as
he
rose
certainly
not
a
few
days
can
make
no
difference
none
for
the
worse
certainly
and
possibly
much
for
the
better
be
it
so
we
will
wait
uncle
said
charles
will
you
spare
me
half
an
hour
of
your
company
an
hour
my
boy
if
you
want
it
said
the
admiral
rising
from
his
chair
then
this
consultation
is
over
said
henry
and
we
quite
understand
that
to
leave
the
hall
is
a
matter
determined
on
and
that
in
a
few
days
a
decision
shall
be
come
to
as
to
whether
varney
the
vampyre
shall
be
its
tenant
or
not
the
admiral's
advice
to
charles
holland--the
challenge
to
the
vampyre
illustration
when
charles
holland
got
his
uncle
into
a
room
by
themselves
he
said--
uncle
you
are
a
seaman
and
accustomed
to
decide
upon
matters
of
honour
i
look
upon
myself
as
having
been
most
grievously
insulted
by
this
sir
francis
varney
all
accounts
agree
in
representing
him
as
a
gentleman
he
goes
openly
by
a
title
which
if
it
were
not
his
could
easily
be
contradicted
therefore
on
the
score
of
position
in
life
there
is
no
fault
to
find
with
him
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
insulted
by
a
gentleman
the
old
admiral's
eyes
sparkled
and
he
looked
comically
in
the
face
of
charles
as
he
said--
i
know
now
where
you
are
steering
what
would
you
do
uncle
fight
him
i
knew
you
would
say
so
and
that's
just
what
i
want
to
do
as
regards
sir
francis
varney
well
my
boy
i
don't
know
that
you
can
do
better
he
must
be
a
thundering
rascal
whether
he
is
a
vampyre
or
not
so
if
you
feel
that
he
has
insulted
you
fight
him
by
all
means
charles
i
am
much
pleased
uncle
to
find
that
you
take
my
view
of
the
subject
said
charles
i
knew
that
if
i
mentioned
such
a
thing
to
the
bannerworths
they
would
endeavour
all
in
their
power
to
pursuade
me
against
it
yes
no
doubt
because
they
are
all
impressed
with
a
strange
fear
of
this
fellow's
vampyre
powers
besides
if
a
man
is
going
to
fight
the
fewer
people
he
mentions
it
to
most
decidedly
the
better
charles
i
believe
that
is
the
fact
uncle
should
i
overcome
varney
there
will
most
likely
be
at
once
an
end
to
the
numerous
and
uncomfortable
perplexities
of
the
bannerworths
as
regards
him
and
if
he
overcome
me
why
then
at
all
events
i
shall
have
made
an
effort
to
rescue
flora
from
the
dread
of
this
man
and
then
he
shall
fight
me
added
the
admiral
so
he
shall
have
two
chances
at
all
events
charles
nay
uncle
that
would
you
know
scarcely
be
fair
besides
if
i
should
fall
i
solemnly
bequeath
flora
bannerworth
to
your
good
offices
i
much
fear
that
the
pecuniary
affairs
of
poor
henry--from
no
fault
of
his
heaven
knows--are
in
a
very
bad
state
and
that
flora
may
yet
live
to
want
some
kind
and
able
friend
never
fear
charles
the
young
creature
shall
never
want
while
the
old
admiral
has
got
a
shot
in
the
locker
thank
you
uncle
thank
you
i
have
ample
cause
to
know
and
to
be
able
to
rely
upon
your
kind
and
generous
nature
and
now
about
the
challenge
you
write
it
boy
and
i'll
take
it
will
you
second
me
uncle
to
be
sure
i
will
i
wouldn't
trust
anybody
else
to
do
so
on
any
account
you
leave
all
the
arrangements
with
me
and
i'll
second
you
as
you
ought
to
be
seconded
then
i
will
write
it
at
once
for
i
have
received
injuries
at
the
hands
of
that
man
or
devil
be
he
what
he
may
that
i
cannot
put
up
with
his
visit
to
the
chamber
of
her
whom
i
love
would
alone
constitute
ample
ground
of
action
i
should
say
it
rather
would
my
boy
and
after
this
corroborative
story
of
the
wound
i
cannot
for
a
moment
doubt
that
sir
francis
varney
is
the
vampyre
or
the
personifier
of
the
vampyre
that's
clear
enough
charles
come
just
you
write
your
challenge
my
boy
at
once
and
let
me
have
it
i
will
uncle
charles
was
a
little
astonished
although
pleased
at
his
uncle's
ready
acquiescence
in
his
fighting
a
vampyre
but
that
circumstance
he
ascribed
to
the
old
man's
habits
of
life
which
made
him
so
familiar
with
strife
and
personal
contentions
of
all
sorts
that
he
did
not
ascribe
to
it
that
amount
of
importance
which
more
peaceable
people
did
had
he
while
he
was
writing
the
note
to
sir
francis
varney
seen
the
old
admiral's
face
and
the
exceedingly
cunning
look
it
wore
he
might
have
suspected
that
the
acquiescence
in
the
duel
was
but
a
seeming
acquiescence
this
however
escaped
him
and
in
a
few
moments
he
read
to
his
uncle
the
following
note--
to
sir
francis
varney
sir--the
expressions
made
use
of
towards
me
by
you
as
well
as
general
circumstances
which
i
need
not
further
allude
to
here
induce
me
to
demand
of
you
that
satisfaction
due
from
one
gentleman
to
another
my
uncle
admiral
bell
is
the
bearer
of
this
note
and
will
arrange
preliminaries
with
any
friend
you
may
choose
to
appoint
to
act
in
your
behalf
i
am
sir
yours
c
charles
holland
will
that
do
said
charles
capital
said
the
admiral
i
am
glad
you
like
it
oh
i
could
not
help
liking
it
the
least
said
and
the
most
to
the
purpose
always
pleases
me
best
and
this
explains
nothing
and
demands
all
you
want--which
is
a
fight
so
it's
all
right
you
see
and
nothing
can
be
possibly
better
charles
did
glance
in
his
uncle's
face
for
he
suspected
from
the
manner
in
which
these
words
were
uttered
that
the
old
man
was
amusing
himself
a
little
at
his
expense
the
admiral
however
looked
so
supernaturally
serious
that
charles
was
foiled
i
repeat
it's
a
capital
letter
he
said
yes
you
said
so
well
what
are
you
staring
at
oh
nothing
do
you
doubt
my
word
not
at
all
uncle
only
i
thought
there
was
a
degree
of
irony
in
the
manner
in
which
you
spoke
none
at
all
my
boy
i
never
was
more
serious
in
all
my
life
very
good
then
you
will
remember
that
i
leave
my
honour
in
this
affair
completely
in
your
hands
depend
upon
me
my
boy
i
will
and
do
i'll
be
off
and
see
the
fellow
at
once
the
admiral
bustled
out
of
the
room
and
in
a
few
moments
charles
heard
him
calling
loudly--
jack--jack
pringle
you
lubber
where
are
you--jack
pringle
i
say
ay
ay
sir
said
jack
emerging
from
the
kitchen
where
he
had
been
making
himself
generally
useful
in
assisting
mrs
bannerworth
there
being
no
servant
in
the
house
to
cook
some
dinner
for
the
family
come
on
you
rascal
we
are
going
for
a
walk
the
rations
will
be
served
out
soon
growled
jack
we
shall
be
back
in
time
you
cormorant
never
fear
you
are
always
thinking
of
eating
and
drinking
you
are
jack
and
i'll
be
hanged
if
i
think
you
ever
think
of
anything
else
come
on
will
you
i'm
going
on
rather
a
particular
cruise
just
now
so
mind
what
you
are
about
aye
aye
sir
said
the
tar
and
these
two
originals
who
so
perfectly
understood
each
other
walked
away
conversing
as
they
went
and
their
different
voices
coming
upon
the
ear
of
charles
until
distance
obliterated
all
impression
of
the
sound
charles
paced
to
and
fro
in
the
room
where
he
had
held
this
brief
and
conclusive
conversation
with
his
uncle
he
was
thoughtful
as
any
one
might
well
be
who
knew
not
but
that
the
next
four-and-twenty
hours
would
be
the
limit
of
his
sojourn
in
this
world
oh
flora--flora
he
at
length
said
how
happy
we
might
to
have
been
together--how
happy
we
might
have
been
but
all
is
past
now
and
there
seems
nothing
left
us
but
to
endure
there
it
but
one
chance
and
that
is
in
my
killing
this
fearful
man
who
is
invested
with
so
dreadful
an
existence
and
if
i
do
kill
him
in
fair
and
in
open
fight
i
will
take
care
that
his
mortal
frame
has
no
power
again
to
revisit
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
it
was
strange
to
imagine
that
such
was
the
force
of
many
concurrent
circumstances
that
a
young
man
like
charles
holland
of
first-rate
abilities
and
education
should
find
it
necessary
to
give
in
so
far
to
a
belief
which
was
repugnant
to
all
his
best
feelings
and
habits
of
thought
as
to
be
reasoning
with
himself
upon
the
best
means
of
preventing
the
resuscitation
of
the
corpse
of
a
vampyre
but
so
it
was
his
imagination
had
yielded
to
a
succession
of
events
which
very
few
persons
indeed
could
have
held
out
against
i
have
heard
and
read
he
said
as
he
continued
his
agitated
and
uneasy
walk
of
how
these
dreadful
beings
are
to
be
in
their
graves
i
have
heard
of
stakes
being
driven
through
the
body
so
as
to
pin
it
to
the
earth
until
the
gradual
progress
of
decay
has
rendered
its
revivification
a
thing
of
utter
and
total
impossibility
then
again
he
added
after
a
slight
pause
i
have
heard
of
their
being
burned
and
the
ashes
gathered
to
the
winds
of
heaven
to
prevent
them
from
ever
again
uniting
or
assuming
human
form
illustration
these
were
disagreeable
and
strange
fancies
and
he
shuddered
while
he
indulged
in
them
he
felt
a
kind
of
trembling
horror
come
over
him
even
at
the
thought
of
engaging
in
conflict
with
a
being
who
perhaps
had
lived
more
than
a
hundred
years
that
portrait
he
thought
on
the
panel
is
the
portrait
of
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
if
it
be
the
portrait
of
sir
francis
varney
by
the
date
which
the
family
ascribe
to
it
he
must
be
nearly
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
age
now
this
was
a
supposition
which
carried
the
imagination
to
a
vast
amount
of
strange
conjectures
what
changes
he
must
have
witnessed
about
him
in
that
time
thought
charles
how
he
must
have
seen
kingdoms
totter
and
fall
and
how
many
changes
of
habits
of
manners
and
of
customs
must
he
have
become
a
spectator
of
renewing
too
ever
and
anon
his
fearful
existence
by
such
fearful
means
this
was
a
wide
field
of
conjecture
for
a
fertile
imagination
and
now
that
he
was
on
the
eve
of
engaging
with
such
a
being
in
mortal
combat
on
behalf
of
her
he
loved
the
thoughts
it
gave
rise
to
came
more
strongly
and
thickly
upon
him
than
ever
they
had
done
before
but
i
will
fight
him
he
suddenly
said
for
flora's
sake
were
he
a
hundred
times
more
hideous
a
being
than
so
many
evidences
tend
to
prove
him
i
will
fight
with
him
and
it
may
be
my
fate
to
rid
the
world
of
such
a
monster
in
human
form
charles
worked
himself
up
to
a
kind
of
enthusiasm
by
which
he
almost
succeeded
in
convincing
himself
that
in
attempting
the
destruction
of
sir
francis
varney
he
was
the
champion
of
human
nature
it
would
be
aside
from
the
object
of
these
pages
which
is
to
record
facts
as
they
occurred
to
enter
into
the
metaphysical
course
of
reasoning
which
came
across
charles's
mind
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
felt
nothing
shaken
as
regarded
his
resolve
to
meet
varney
the
vampyre
and
that
he
made
up
his
mind
the
conflict
should
be
one
of
life
or
death
it
must
be
so
he
said
it
must
be
so
either
he
or
i
must
fall
in
the
fight
which
shall
surely
be
he
now
sought
flora
for
how
soon
might
he
now
be
torn
from
her
for
ever
by
the
irresistible
hand
of
death
he
felt
that
during
the
few
brief
hours
which
now
would
only
elapse
previous
to
his
meeting
with
sir
francis
varney
he
could
not
enjoy
too
much
of
the
society
of
her
who
reigned
supreme
in
his
heart
and
held
in
her
own
keeping
his
best
affections
but
while
charles
is
thus
employed
let
us
follow
his
uncle
and
jack
pringle
to
the
residence
of
varney
which
as
the
reader
is
aware
was
so
near
at
hand
that
it
required
not
many
minutes'
sharp
walking
to
reach
it
the
admiral
knew
well
he
could
trust
jack
with
any
secret
for
long
habits
of
discipline
and
deference
to
the
orders
of
superiors
takes
off
the
propensity
to
blabbing
which
among
civilians
who
are
not
accustomed
to
discipline
is
so
very
prevalent
the
old
man
therefore
explained
to
jack
what
he
meant
to
do
and
it
received
jack's
full
approval
but
as
in
the
enforced
detail
of
other
matters
it
must
come
out
we
will
not
here
prematurely
enter
into
the
admiral's
plans
when
they
reached
the
residence
of
sir
francis
varney
they
were
received
courteously
enough
and
the
admiral
desired
jack
to
wait
for
him
in
the
handsome
hall
of
the
house
while
he
was
shewn
up
stairs
to
the
private
room
of
the
vampyre
confound
the
fellow
muttered
the
old
admiral
he
is
well
lodged
at
all
events
i
should
say
he
was
not
one
of
those
sort
of
vampyres
who
have
nowhere
to
go
to
but
their
own
coffins
when
the
evening
comes
the
room
into
which
the
admiral
was
shewn
had
green
blinds
to
it
and
they
were
all
drawn
down
it
is
true
that
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
outside
although
transiently
but
still
a
strange
green
tinge
was
thrown
over
everything
in
the
room
and
more
particularly
did
it
appear
to
fall
upon
the
face
of
varney
converting
his
usually
sallow
countenance
into
a
still
more
hideous
and
strange
colour
he
was
sitting
upon
a
couch
and
when
the
admiral
came
in
he
rose
and
said
in
a
deep-toned
voice
extremely
different
to
that
he
usually
spoke
in--
my
humble
home
is
much
honoured
sir
by
your
presence
in
it
good
morning
said
the
admiral
i
have
come
to
speak
to
you
sir
rather
seriously
however
abrupt
this
announcement
may
sound
to
me
said
varney
i
am
quite
sure
i
shall
always
hear
with
the
most
profound
respect
whatever
admiral
bell
may
have
to
say
there
is
no
respect
required
said
the
admiral
but
only
a
little
attention
sir
francis
bowed
in
a
stately
manner
saying--
i
shall
be
quite
unhappy
if
you
will
not
be
seated
admiral
bell
oh
never
mind
that
sir
francis
varney
if
you
be
sir
francis
varney
for
you
may
be
the
devil
himself
for
all
i
know
my
nephew
charles
holland
considers
that
one
way
and
another
he
has
a
very
tolerable
quarrel
with
you
i
much
grieve
to
hear
it
do
you
believe
me
i
do
i
am
most
scrupulous
in
what
i
say
and
an
assertion
that
i
am
grieved
you
may
thoroughly
and
entirely
depend
upon
well
well
never
mind
that
charles
holland
is
a
young
man
just
entering
into
life
he
loves
a
girl
who
is
i
think
every
way
worthy
of
him
oh
what
a
felicitous
prospect
just
hear
me
out
if
you
please
with
pleasure
sir--with
pleasure
well
then
when
a
young
hot-headed
fellow
thinks
he
has
a
good
ground
of
quarrel
with
anybody
you
will
not
be
surprised
at
his
wanting
to
fight
it
out
not
at
all
well
then
to
come
to
the
point
my
nephew
charles
holland
has
a
fancy
for
fighting
with
you
ah
you
take
it
d----d
easy
my
dear
sir
why
should
i
be
uneasy
he
is
not
my
nephew
you
know
i
shall
have
no
particular
cause
beyond
those
feelings
of
common
compassion
which
i
hope
inhabit
my
breast
as
well
as
every
one
else's
what
do
you
mean
why
he
is
a
young
man
just
as
you
say
entering
into
life
and
i
cannot
help
thinking
it
would
be
a
pity
to
cut
him
off
like
a
flower
in
the
bud
so
very
soon
oh
you
make
quite
sure
then
of
settling
him
do
you
my
dear
sir
only
consider
he
might
be
very
troublesome
indeed
you
know
young
men
are
hot-headed
and
troublesome
even
if
i
were
only
to
maim
him
he
might
be
a
continual
and
never-ceasing
annoyance
to
me
i
think
i
should
be
absolutely
in
a
manner
of
speaking
compelled
to
cut
him
off
the
devil
you
do
as
you
say
sir
d--n
your
assurance
mr
vampyre
or
whatever
odd
fish
you
may
be
admiral
bell
i
never
called
upon
you
and
received
a
courteous
reception
and
then
insulted
you
then
why
do
you
talk
of
cutting
off
a
better
man
than
yourself
d--n
it
what
would
you
say
to
him
cutting
you
off
oh
as
for
me
my
good
sir
that's
quite
another
thing
cutting
me
off
is
very
doubtful
sir
francis
varney
gave
a
strange
smile
as
he
spoke
and
shook
his
head
as
if
some
most
extraordinary
and
extravagant
proposition
had
been
mooted
which
it
was
scarcely
worth
the
while
of
anybody
possessed
of
common
sense
to
set
about
expecting
admiral
bell
felt
strongly
inclined
to
get
into
a
rage
but
he
repressed
the
idea
as
much
as
he
could
although
but
for
the
curious
faint
green
light
that
came
through
the
blinds
his
heightened
colour
would
have
sufficiently
proclaimed
what
state
of
mind
he
was
in
mr
varney
he
said
all
this
is
quite
beside
the
question
but
at
all
events
if
it
have
any
weight
at
all
it
ought
to
have
a
considerable
influence
in
deciding
you
to
accept
of
what
terms
i
propose
what
are
they
sir
why
that
you
permit
me
to
espouse
my
nephew
charles's
quarrel
and
meet
you
instead
of
him
you
meet
me
yes
i've
met
a
better
man
more
than
once
before
it
can
make
no
difference
to
you
i
don't
know
that
admiral
bell
one
generally
likes
in
a
duel
to
face
him
with
whom
one
has
had
the
misunderstanding
be
it
on
what
grounds
it
may
there's
some
reason
i
know
in
what
you
say
but
surely
if
i
am
willing
you
need
not
object
and
is
your
nephew
willing
thus
to
shift
the
danger
and
the
job
of
resenting
his
own
quarrels
on
to
your
shoulders
no
he
knows
nothing
about
it
he
has
written
you
a
challenge
of
which
i
am
the
bearer
but
i
voluntarily
and
of
my
own
accord
wish
to
meet
you
instead
this
is
a
strange
mode
of
proceeding
if
you
will
not
accede
to
it
and
fight
him
first
and
any
harm
comes
to
him
you
shall
fight
me
afterwards
indeed
yes
indeed
you
shall
however
surprised
you
may
look
as
this
appears
to
be
quite
a
family
affair
then
said
sir
francis
varney
it
certainly
does
appear
immaterial
which
of
you
i
fight
with
first
quite
so
now
you
take
a
sensible
view
of
the
question
will
you
meet
me
i
have
no
particular
objection
have
you
settled
all
your
affairs
and
made
your
will
what's
that
to
you
oh
i
only
asked
because
there
is
generally
so
much
food
for
litigation
if
a
man
dies
intestate
and
is
worth
any
money
you
make
devilish
sure
said
the
admiral
of
being
the
victor
have
you
made
your
will
oh
my
will
smiled
sir
francis
that
my
good
sir
is
quite
an
indifferent
affair
well
make
it
or
not
as
you
like
i
am
old
i
know
but
i
can
pull
a
trigger
as
well
as
any
one
do
what
pull
a
trigger
why
you
don't
suppose
i
resort
to
any
such
barbarous
modes
of
fighting
barbarous
why
how
do
you
fight
then
as
a
gentleman
with
my
sword
swords
oh
nonsense
nobody
fights
with
swords
now-a-days
that's
all
exploded
i
cling
to
the
customs
and
the
fashions
of
my
youth
said
varney
i
have
been
years
ago
accustomed
always
to
wear
a
sword
and
to
be
without
one
now
vexes
me
pray
how
many
years
ago
i
am
older
than
i
look
but
that
is
not
the
question
i
am
willing
to
meet
you
with
swords
if
you
like
you
are
no
doubt
aware
that
as
the
challenged
party
i
am
entitled
to
the
choice
of
weapons
i
am
then
you
cannot
object
to
my
availing
myself
of
the
one
in
the
use
of
which
i
am
perfectly
unequalled
indeed
yes
i
am
i
think
the
first
swordsman
in
europe
i
have
had
immense
practice
well
sir
you
have
certainly
made
a
most
unexpected
choice
of
weapons
i
can
use
a
sword
still
but
am
by
no
means
a
master
of
fencing
however
it
shall
not
be
said
that
i
went
back
from
my
word
and
let
the
chances
be
as
desperate
as
they
may
i
will
meet
you
very
good
with
swords
ay
with
swords
but
i
must
have
everything
properly
arranged
so
that
no
blame
can
rest
on
me
you
know
as
you
will
be
killed
you
are
safe
from
all
consequences
but
i
shall
be
in
a
very
different
position
so
if
you
please
i
must
have
this
meeting
got
up
in
such
a
manner
as
shall
enable
me
to
prove
to
whoever
may
question
me
on
the
subject
that
you
had
fair
play
oh
never
fear
that
but
i
do
fear
it
the
world
my
good
sir
is
censorious
and
you
cannot
stop
people
from
saying
extremely
ill-natured
things
what
do
you
require
then
i
require
you
to
send
me
a
friend
with
a
formal
challenge
well
then
i
shall
refer
him
to
a
friend
of
mine
and
they
two
must
settle
everything
between
them
is
that
all
not
quite
i
will
have
a
surgeon
on
the
ground
in
case
when
i
pink
you
there
should
be
a
chance
of
saving
your
life
it
always
looks
humane
when
you
pink
me
precisely
upon
my
word
you
take
these
affairs
easy
i
suppose
you
have
had
a
few
of
them
oh
a
good
number
people
like
yourself
worry
me
into
them
i
don't
like
the
trouble
i
assure
you
it
is
no
amusement
to
me
i
would
rather
by
a
great
deal
make
some
concession
than
fight
because
i
will
fight
with
swords
and
the
result
is
then
so
certain
that
there
is
no
danger
in
the
matter
to
me
hark
you
sir
francis
varney
you
are
either
a
very
clever
actor
or
a
man
as
you
say
of
such
skill
with
your
sword
that
you
can
make
sure
of
the
result
of
a
duel
you
know
therefore
that
it
is
not
fair
play
on
your
part
to
fight
a
duel
with
that
weapon
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
there
i
never
challenge
anybody
and
when
foolish
people
will
call
me
out
contrary
to
my
inclination
i
think
i
am
bound
to
take
what
care
of
myself
i
can
d--n
me
there's
some
reason
in
that
too
said
the
admiral
but
why
do
you
insult
people
people
insult
me
first
oh
nonsense
how
should
you
like
to
be
called
a
vampyre
and
stared
at
as
if
you
were
some
hideous
natural
phenomenon
well
but--
i
say
admiral
bell
how
should
you
like
it
i
am
a
harmless
country
gentleman
and
because
in
the
heated
imaginations
of
some
member
of
a
crack-brained
family
some
housebreaker
has
been
converted
into
a
vampyre
i
am
to
be
pitched
upon
as
the
man
and
insulted
and
persecuted
accordingly
but
you
forget
the
proofs
what
proofs
the
portrait
for
one
what
because
there
is
an
accidental
likeness
between
me
and
an
old
picture
am
i
to
be
set
down
as
a
vampyre
why
when
i
was
in
austria
last
i
saw
an
old
portrait
of
a
celebrated
court
fool
and
you
so
strongly
resemble
it
that
i
was
quite
struck
when
i
first
saw
you
with
the
likeness
but
i
was
not
so
unpolite
as
to
tell
you
that
i
considered
you
were
the
court
fool
turned
vampyre
d--n
your
assurance
and
d--n
yours
if
you
come
to
that
the
admiral
was
fairly
beaten
sir
francis
varney
was
by
far
too
long-headed
and
witty
for
him
after
now
in
vain
endeavouring
to
find
something
to
say
the
old
man
buttoned
up
his
coat
in
a
great
passion
and
looking
fiercely
at
varney
he
said--i
don't
pretend
to
a
gift
of
the
gab
d--n
me
it
ain't
one
of
my
peculiarities
but
though
you
may
talk
me
down
you
sha'n't
keep
me
down
very
good
sir
it
is
not
very
good
you
shall
hear
from
me
i
am
willing
i
don't
care
whether
you
are
willing
or
not
you
shall
find
that
when
once
i
begin
to
tackle
an
enemy
i
don't
so
easily
leave
him
one
or
both
of
us
sir
is
sure
to
sink
agreed
so
say
i
you
shall
find
that
i'm
a
tar
for
all
weathers
and
if
you
were
a
hundred
and
fifty
vampires
all
rolled
into
one
i'd
tackle
you
somehow
the
admiral
walked
to
the
door
in
high
dudgeon
when
he
was
near
to
it
varney
said
in
some
of
his
most
winning
and
gentle
accents--
will
you
not
take
some
refreshment
sir
before
you
go
from
my
humble
house
no
roared
the
admiral
something
cooling
no
very
good
sir
a
hospitable
host
can
do
no
more
than
offer
to
entertain
his
guests
admiral
bell
turned
at
the
door
and
said
with
some
degree
of
intense
bitterness
you
look
rather
poorly
i
suppose
to-night
you
will
go
and
suck
somebody's
blood
you
shark--you
confounded
vampyre
you
ought
to
be
made
to
swallow
a
red-hot
brick
and
then
let
dance
about
till
it
digests
varney
smiled
as
he
rang
the
bell
and
said
to
a
servant--
show
my
very
excellent
friend
admiral
bell
out
he
will
not
take
any
refreshments
the
servant
bowed
and
preceded
the
admiral
down
the
staircase
but
to
his
great
surprise
instead
of
a
compliment
in
the
shape
of
a
shilling
or
half-a-crown
for
his
pains
he
received
a
tremendous
kick
behind
with
a
request
to
go
and
take
it
to
his
master
with
his
compliments
the
fume
that
the
old
admiral
was
in
beggars
all
description
he
walked
to
bannerworth
hall
at
such
a
rapid
pace
that
jack
pringle
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
the
world
to
keep
up
with
him
so
as
to
be
at
all
within
speaking
distance
hilloa
jack
cried
the
old
man
when
they
were
close
to
the
hall
did
you
see
me
kick
that
fellow
ay
ay
sir
well
that's
some
consolation
at
any
rate
if
somebody
saw
it
it
ought
to
have
been
his
master
that's
all
i
can
say
to
it
and
i
wish
it
had
how
have
you
settled
it
sir
settled
what
the
fight
sir
d--n
me
jack
i
haven't
settled
it
at
all
that's
bad
sir
i
know
it
is
but
it
shall
be
settled
for
all
that
i
can
tell
him
let
him
vapour
as
much
as
he
may
about
pinking
me
and
one
thing
and
another
pinking
you
sir
yes
he
wants
to
fight
with
cutlasses
or
toasting-forks
d--n
me
i
don't
know
exactly
which
and
then
he
must
have
a
surgeon
on
the
ground
for
fear
when
he
pinks
me
i
shouldn't
slip
my
cable
in
a
regular
way
and
he
should
be
blamed
jack
gave
a
long
whistle
as
he
replied--
going
to
do
it
sir
i
don't
know
now
what
i'm
going
to
do
mind
jack
mum
is
the
word
ay
ay
sir
i'll
turn
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
and
then
decide
upon
what
had
best
be
done
if
he
pinks
me
i'll
take
d----d
good
care
he
don't
pink
charles
no
sir
don't
let
him
do
that
a
wamphigher
sir
ain't
no
good
opponent
to
anybody
i
never
seed
one
afore
but
it
strikes
me
as
the
best
way
to
settle
him
would
be
to
shut
him
up
in
some
little
bit
of
a
cabin
and
then
smoke
him
with
brimstone
sir
well
well
i'll
consider
jack
i'll
consider
something
must
be
done
and
that
quickly
too
zounds
here's
charles--what
the
deuce
shall
i
say
to
him
by
way
of
an
excuse
i
wonder
for
not
arranging
his
affair
with
varney
hang
me
if
i
ain't
taken
aback
now
and
don't
know
where
to
place
a
hand
the
letter
to
charles--the
quarrel--the
admiral's
narrative--the
midnight
meeting
illustration
it
was
charles
holland
who
now
advanced
hurriedly
to
meet
the
admiral
the
young
man's
manner
was
anxious
he
was
evidently
most
intent
upon
knowing
what
answer
could
be
sent
by
sir
francis
varney
to
his
challenge
uncle
he
said
tell
me
at
once
will
he
meet
me
you
can
talk
of
particulars
afterwards
but
now
tell
me
at
once
if
he
will
meet
me
why
as
to
that
said
the
admiral
with
a
great
deal
of
fidgetty
hesitation
you
see
i
can't
exactly
say
not
say
no
he's
a
very
odd
fish
don't
you
think
he's
a
very
odd
fish
jack
pringle'
ay
ay
sir
there
you
hear
charles
that
jack
is
of
my
opinion
that
your
opponent
is
an
odd
fish
but
uncle
why
trifle
with
my
impatience
thus
have
you
seen
sir
francis
varney
seen
him
oh
yes
and
what
did
he
say
why
to
tell
the
truth
my
lad
i
advise
you
not
to
fight
with
him
at
all
uncle
is
this
like
you
this
advice
from
you
to
compromise
my
honour
after
sending
a
man
a
challenge
d--n
it
all
jack
i
don't
know
how
to
get
out
of
it
said
the
admiral
i
tell
you
what
it
is
charles
he
wants
to
fight
with
swords
and
what
on
earth
is
the
use
of
your
engaging
with
a
fellow
who
has
been
practising
at
his
weapon
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
well
uncle
if
any
one
had
told
me
that
you
would
be
terrified
by
this
sir
francis
varney
into
advising
me
not
to
fight
i
should
have
had
no
hesitation
whatever
in
saying
such
a
thing
was
impossible
i
terrified
why
you
advise
me
not
to
meet
this
man
even
after
i
have
challenged
him
jack
said
the
admiral
i
can't
carry
it
on
you
see
i
never
could
go
on
with
anything
that
was
not
as
plain
as
an
anchor
and
quite
straightforward
i
must
just
tell
all
that
has
occurred
ay
ay
sir
the
best
way
you
think
so
jack
i
know
it
is
sir
always
axing
pardon
for
having
a
opinion
at
all
excepting
when
it
happens
to
be
the
same
as
yourn
sir
hold
your
tongue
you
libellous
villain
now
listen
to
me
charles
i
got
up
a
scheme
of
my
own
charles
gave
a
groan
for
he
had
a
very
tolerable
appreciation
of
his
uncle's
amount
of
skill
in
getting
up
a
scheme
of
any
kind
or
description
now
here
am
i
continued
the
admiral
an
old
hulk
and
not
fit
for
use
anymore
what's
the
use
of
me
i
should
like
to
know
well
that's
settled
but
you
are
young
and
hearty
and
have
a
long
life
before
you
why
should
you
throw
away
your
life
upon
a
lubberly
vampyre
i
begin
to
perceive
now
uncle
said
charles
reproachfully
why
you
with
such
apparent
readiness
agreed
to
this
duel
taking
place
well
i
intended
to
fight
the
fellow
myself
that's
the
long
and
short
of
it
boy
how
could
you
treat
me
so
no
nonsense
charles
i
tell
you
it
was
all
in
the
family
i
intended
to
fight
him
myself
what
was
the
odds
whether
i
slipped
my
cable
with
his
assistance
or
in
the
regular
course
a
little
after
this
that's
the
way
to
argufy
the
subject
so
as
i
tell
you
i
made
up
my
mind
to
fight
him
myself
charles
looked
despairingly
but
said--
what
was
the
result
oh
the
result
d--n
me
i
suppose
that's
to
come
the
vagabond
won't
fight
like
a
christian
he
says
he's
quite
willing
to
fight
anybody
that
calls
him
out
provided
it's
all
regular
well--well
and
he
being
the
party
challenged--for
he
says
he
never
himself
challenges
anybody
as
he
is
quite
tired
of
it--must
have
his
choice
of
weapons
he
is
entitled
to
that
but
it
is
generally
understood
now-a-days
that
pistols
are
the
weapons
in
use
among
gentlemen
for
such
purposes
ah
but
he
won't
understand
any
such
thing
i
tell
you
he
will
fight
with
swords
i
suppose
he
is
then
an
adept
at
the
use
of
the
sword
he
says
he
is
no
doubt--no
doubt
i
cannot
blame
a
man
for
choosing
when
he
has
the
liberty
of
choice
that
weapon
in
the
use
of
which
he
most
particularly
from
practice
excels
yes
but
if
he
be
one
half
the
swordsman
he
has
had
time
enough
according
to
all
accounts
to
be
what
sort
of
chance
have
you
with
him
do
i
hear
you
reasoning
thus
yes
to
be
sure
you
do
i
have
turned
wonderfully
prudent
you
see
so
i
mean
to
fight
him
myself
and
mind
now
you
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
an
effort
of
prudence
that
certainly
well
didn't
i
say
so
come--come
uncle
this
won't
do
i
have
challenged
sir
francis
varney
and
i
must
meet
him
with
any
weapon
he
may
as
the
challenged
party
choose
to
select
besides
you
are
not
i
dare
say
aware
that
i
am
a
very
good
fencer
and
probably
stand
as
fair
a
chance
as
varney
in
a
contest
with
swords
indeed
yes
uncle
i
could
not
be
so
long
on
the
continent
as
i
have
been
without
picking
up
a
good
knowledge
of
the
sword
which
is
so
popular
all
over
germany
humph
but
only
consider
this
d----d
fellow
is
no
less
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
i
care
not
yes
but
i
do
uncle
uncle
i
tell
you
i
will
fight
with
him
and
if
you
do
not
arrange
matters
for
me
so
that
i
can
have
the
meeting
with
this
man
which
i
have
myself
sought
and
cannot
even
if
i
wished
now
recede
from
with
honour
i
must
seek
some
other
less
scrupulous
friend
to
do
so
give
me
an
hour
or
two
to
think
of
it
charles
said
the
admiral
don't
speak
to
any
one
else
but
give
me
a
little
time
you
shall
have
no
cause
of
complaint
your
honour
cannot
suffer
in
my
hands
i
will
wait
your
leisure
uncle
but
remember
that
such
affairs
as
these
when
once
broached
had
always
better
be
concluded
with
all
convenient
dispatch
i
know
that
boy--i
know
that
the
admiral
walked
away
and
charles
who
really
felt
much
fretted
at
the
delay
which
had
taken
place
returned
to
the
house
he
had
not
been
there
long
when
a
lad
who
had
been
temporarily
hired
during
the
morning
by
henry
to
answer
the
gate
brought
him
a
note
saying--
a
servant
sir
left
this
for
you
just
now
for
me
said
charles
as
he
glanced
at
the
direction
this
is
strange
for
i
have
no
acquaintance
about
here
does
any
one
wait
no
sir
the
note
was
properly
directed
to
him
therefore
charles
holland
at
once
opened
it
a
glance
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
told
him
that
it
came
from
his
enemy
sir
francis
varney
and
then
he
read
it
with
much
eagerness
it
ran
thus--
sir--your
uncle
as
he
stated
himself
to
be
admiral
bell
was
the
bearer
to
me
as
i
understood
him
this
day
of
a
challenge
from
you
owing
to
some
unaccountable
hallucination
of
intellect
he
seemed
to
imagine
that
i
intended
to
set
myself
up
as
a
sort
of
animated
target
for
any
one
to
shoot
at
who
might
have
a
fancy
so
to
do
according
to
this
eccentric
view
of
the
case
the
admiral
had
the
kindness
to
offer
to
fight
me
first
when
should
he
not
have
the
good
fortune
to
put
me
out
of
the
world
you
were
to
try
your
skill
doubtless
i
need
scarcely
say
that
i
object
to
these
family
arrangements
you
have
challenged
me
and
fancying
the
offence
sufficient
you
defy
me
to
mortal
combat
if
therefore
i
fight
with
any
one
at
all
it
must
be
with
you
you
will
clearly
understand
me
sir
that
i
do
not
accuse
you
of
being
at
all
party
to
this
freak
of
intellect
of
your
uncle's
he
no
doubt
alone
conceived
it
with
a
laudable
desire
on
his
part
of
serving
you
if
however
to
meet
me
do
so
to-night
in
the
middle
of
the
park
surrounding
your
own
friends
estate
there
is
a
pollard
oak
growing
close
to
a
small
pool
you
no
doubt
have
noticed
the
spot
often
meet
me
there
if
you
please
and
any
satisfaction
you
like
i
will
give
you
at
twelve
o'clock
this
night
come
alone
or
you
will
not
see
me
it
shall
be
at
your
own
option
entirely
to
convert
the
meeting
into
a
hostile
one
or
not
you
need
send
me
no
answer
to
this
if
you
are
at
the
place
i
mention
at
the
time
i
have
named
well
and
good
if
you
an
not
i
can
only
if
i
please
imagine
that
you
shrink
from
a
meeting
with
francis
varney
charles
holland
read
this
letter
twice
over
carefully
and
then
folding
it
up
and
placing
it
in
his
pocket
he
said--
yes
i
will
meet
him
he
may
be
assured
that
i
will
meet
him
he
shall
find
that
i
do
not
shrink
from
francis
varney
in
the
name
of
honour
love
virtue
and
heaven
i
will
meet
this
man
and
it
shall
go
hard
with
me
but
i
will
this
night
wring
from
him
the
secret
of
what
he
really
is
for
the
sake
of
her
who
is
so
dear
to
me--for
her
sake
i
will
meet
this
man
or
monster
be
he
what
he
may
it
would
have
been
far
more
prudent
had
charles
informed
henry
bannerworth
or
george
of
his
determination
to
meet
the
vampyre
that
evening
but
he
did
not
do
so
somehow
he
fancied
it
would
be
some
reproach
against
his
courage
if
he
did
not
go
and
go
alone
too
for
he
could
not
help
suspecting
that
from
the
conduct
of
his
uncle
sir
francis
varney
might
have
got
up
an
opinion
inimical
to
his
courage
with
all
the
eager
excitement
of
youth
there
was
nothing
that
arrayed
itself
to
his
mind
in
such
melancholy
and
uncomfortable
colours
as
an
imputation
upon
his
courage
i
will
show
this
vampyre
if
he
be
such
he
said
that
i
am
not
afraid
to
meet
him
and
alone
too
at
his
own
hour--at
midnight
even
when
if
his
preternatural
powers
be
of
more
avail
to
him
than
at
any
other
time
he
can
attempt
if
he
dare
to
use
them
charles
resolved
upon
going
armed
and
with
the
greatest
care
he
loaded
his
pistols
and
placed
them
aside
ready
for
action
when
the
time
should
come
to
set
out
to
meet
the
vampyre
at
the
spot
in
the
park
which
had
been
particularly
alluded
to
in
his
letter
this
spot
was
perfectly
well
known
to
charles
indeed
no
one
could
be
a
single
day
at
bannerworth
hall
without
noticing
it
so
prominent
an
object
was
that
pollard
oak
standing
as
it
did
alone
with
the
beautiful
green
sward
all
around
it
near
to
it
was
the
pool
which
hid
been
mentioned
which
was
in
reality
a
fish-pond
and
some
little
distance
off
commenced
the
thick
plantation
among
the
intricacies
of
which
sir
francis
varney
or
the
vampyre
had
been
supposed
to
disappear
after
the
revivification
of
his
body
at
the
full
of
the
moon
this
spot
was
in
view
of
several
of
the
windows
of
the
house
so
that
if
the
night
should
happen
to
be
a
very
light
one
and
any
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
hall
should
happen
to
have
the
curiosity
to
look
from
those
particular
windows
no
doubt
the
meeting
between
charles
holland
and
the
vampyre
would
be
seen
this
however
was
a
contingency
which
was
nothing
to
charles
whatever
it
might
be
to
sir
francis
varney
and
he
scarcely
at
all
considered
it
as
worth
consideration
he
felt
more
happy
and
comfortable
now
that
everything
seemed
to
be
definitively
arranged
by
which
he
could
come
to
some
sort
of
explanation
with
that
mysterious
being
who
had
so
effectually
as
yet
succeeded
in
destroying
his
peace
of
mind
and
his
prospects
of
happiness
i
will
this
night
force
him
to
declare
himself
thought
charles
he
shall
tell
me
who
and
what
he
really
is
and
by
some
means
i
will
endeavour
to
put
an
end
to
those
frightful
persecutions
which
flora
has
suffered
this
was
a
thought
which
considerably
raised
charles's
spirits
and
when
he
sought
flora
again
which
he
now
did
she
was
surprised
to
see
him
so
much
more
easy
and
composed
in
his
mind
which
was
sufficiently
shown
by
his
manner
than
he
had
been
but
so
short
a
time
before
charles
she
said
what
has
happened
to
give
such
an
impetus
to
your
spirits
nothing
dear
flora
nothing
but
i
have
been
endeavouring
to
throw
from
my
mind
all
gloomy
thoughts
and
to
convince
myself
that
in
the
future
you
and
i
dearest
may
yet
be
very
happy
oh
charles
if
i
could
but
think
so
endeavour
flora
to
think
so
remember
how
much
our
happiness
is
always
in
our
own
power
flora
and
that
let
fate
do
her
worst
so
long
as
we
are
true
to
each
other
we
have
a
recompense
for
every
ill
oh
indeed
charles
that
is
a
dear
recompense
and
it
is
well
that
no
force
of
circumstances
short
of
death
itself
can
divide
us
true
charles
true
and
i
am
more
than
ever
now
bound
to
look
upon
you
with
a
loving
heart
for
have
you
not
clung
to
me
generously
under
circumstances
which
if
any
at
all
could
have
justified
you
in
rending
asunder
every
tie
which
bound
us
together
surely
would
have
done
so
most
fully
it
is
misfortune
and
distress
that
tries
love
said
charles
it
is
thus
that
the
touchstone
is
applied
to
see
if
it
be
current
gold
indeed
or
some
base
metal
which
by
a
superficial
glitter
imitates
it
and
your
love
is
indeed
true
gold
i
am
unworthy
of
one
glance
from
those
dear
eyes
if
it
were
not
oh
if
we
could
but
go
from
here
i
think
then
we
might
be
happy
a
strong
impression
is
upon
my
mind
and
has
been
so
for
some
time
that
these
persecutions
to
which
i
have
been
subjected
are
peculiar
to
this
house
think
you
so
i
do
indeed
it
may
be
so
flora
you
are
aware
that
your
brother
has
made
up
his
mind
that
he
will
leave
the
hall
yes
yes
and
that
only
in
deference
to
an
expressed
wish
of
mine
he
put
off
the
carrying
such
a
resolve
into
effect
for
a
few
days
he
said
so
much
do
not
however
imagine
dearest
flora
that
those
few
days
will
be
idly
spent
nay
charles
i
could
not
imagine
so
believe
me
i
have
some
hopes
that
in
that
short
space
of
time
i
shall
be
able
to
accomplish
yet
something
which
shall
have
a
material
effect
upon
the
present
posture
of
affairs
do
not
run
into
danger
charles
i
will
not
believe
me
flora
i
have
too
much
appreciation
of
the
value
of
an
existence
which
is
blessed
by
your
love
to
encounter
any
needless
risks
you
say
needless
why
do
you
not
confide
in
me
and
tell
me
if
the
object
you
have
in
view
to
accomplish
in
the
few
days
delay
is
a
dangerous
one
at
all
will
you
forgive
me
flora
if
for
once
i
keep
a
secret
from
you
then
charles
along
with
the
forgiveness
i
must
conjure
up
a
host
of
apprehensions
nay
why
so
you
would
tell
me
if
there
were
no
circumstances
that
you
feared
would
fill
me
with
alarm
now
flora
your
fears
and
not
your
judgment
condemn
me
surely
you
cannot
think
me
so
utterly
heedless
as
to
court
danger
for
danger's
sake
no
not
so--
you
pause
and
yet
you
have
a
sense
of
what
you
call
honour
which
i
fear
would
lead
you
into
much
risk
i
have
a
sense
of
honour
but
not
that
foolish
one
which
hangs
far
more
upon
the
opinions
of
others
than
my
own
if
i
thought
a
course
of
honour
lay
before
me
and
all
the
world
in
a
mistaken
judgment
were
to
condemn
it
as
wrong
i
would
follow
it
you
are
right
charles
you
are
right
let
me
pray
of
you
to
be
careful
and
at
all
events
to
interpose
no
more
delay
to
our
leaving
this
house
than
you
shall
feel
convinced
is
absolutely
necessary
for
some
object
of
real
and
permanent
importance
charles
promised
flora
bannerworth
that
for
her
sake
as
well
as
his
own
he
would
be
most
specially
careful
of
his
safety
and
then
in
such
endearing
conversation
as
may
be
well
supposed
to
be
dictated
by
such
hearts
as
theirs
another
happy
hour
was
passed
away
illustration
they
pictured
to
themselves
the
scene
where
first
they
met
and
with
a
world
of
interest
hanging
on
every
word
they
uttered
they
told
each
other
of
the
first
delightful
dawnings
of
that
affection
which
had
sprung
up
between
them
and
which
they
fondly
believed
neither
time
nor
circumstance
would
have
the
power
to
change
or
subvert
in
the
meantime
the
old
admiral
was
surprised
that
charles
was
so
patient
and
had
not
been
to
him
to
demand
the
result
of
his
deliberation
but
he
knew
not
on
what
rapid
pinions
time
flies
when
in
the
presence
of
those
whom
we
love
what
was
an
actual
hour
was
but
a
fleeting
minute
to
charles
holland
as
he
sat
with
flora's
hand
clasped
in
his
and
looking
at
her
sweet
face
at
length
a
clock
striking
reminded
him
of
his
engagement
with
his
uncle
and
he
reluctantly
rose
dear
flora
he
said
i
am
going
to
sit
up
to
watch
to-night
so
be
under
no
sort
of
apprehension
i
will
feel
doubly
safe
she
said
i
have
now
something
to
talk
to
my
uncle
about
and
must
leave
you
flora
smiled
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
pressed
it
to
his
heart
he
knew
not
what
impulse
came
over
him
then
but
for
the
first
time
he
kissed
the
cheek
of
the
beautiful
girl
with
a
heightened
colour
she
gently
repulsed
him
he
took
a
long
lingering
look
at
her
as
he
passed
out
of
the
room
and
when
the
door
was
closed
between
them
the
sensation
he
experienced
was
as
if
some
sudden
cloud
had
swept
across
the
face
of
the
sun
dimming
to
a
vast
extent
its
precious
lustre
a
strange
heaviness
came
across
his
spirits
which
before
had
been
so
unaccountably
raised
he
felt
as
if
the
shadow
of
some
coming
evil
was
resting
on
his
soul--as
if
some
momentous
calamity
was
preparing
for
him
which
would
almost
be
enough
to
drive
him
to
madness
and
irredeemable
despair
what
can
this
be
he
exclaimed
that
thus
oppresses
me
what
feeling
is
this
that
seems
to
tell
me
i
shall
never
again
see
flora
bannerworth
unconsciously
he
uttered
these
words
which
betrayed
the
nature
of
his
worst
forebodings
oh
this
is
weakness
he
then
added
i
must
fight
out
against
this
it
is
mere
nervousness
i
must
not
endure
it
i
will
not
suffer
myself
thus
to
become
the
sport
of
imagination
courage
courage
charles
holland
there
are
real
evils
enough
without
your
adding
to
them
by
those
of
a
disordered
fancy
courage
courage
courage
the
admiral's
opinion--the
request
of
charles
illustration
charles
then
sought
the
admiral
whom
he
found
with
his
hands
behind
him
pacing
to
and
fro
in
one
of
the
long
walks
of
the
garden
evidently
in
a
very
unsettled
state
of
mind
when
charles
appeared
he
quickened
his
pace
and
looked
in
such
a
state
of
unusual
perplexity
that
it
was
quite
ridiculous
to
observe
him
i
suppose
uncle
you
have
made
up
your
mind
thoroughly
by
this
time
well
i
don't
know
that
why
you
have
had
long
enough
surely
to
think
over
it
i
have
not
troubled
you
soon
well
i
cannot
exactly
say
you
have
but
somehow
or
another
i
don't
think
very
fast
and
i
have
an
unfortunate
propensity
after
a
time
of
coming
exactly
round
to
where
i
began
then
to
tell
the
truth
uncle
you
can
come
to
no
sort
of
conclusion
only
one
and
what
may
that
be
why
that
you
are
right
in
one
thing
charles
which
is
that
having
sent
a
challenge
to
this
fellow
of
a
vampyre
you
must
fight
him
i
suspect
that
that
is
a
conclusion
you
had
from
the
first
uncle
why
so
because
it
is
an
obvious
and
a
natural
one
all
your
doubts
and
trouble
and
perplexities
have
been
to
try
and
find
some
excuse
for
not
entertaining
that
opinion
and
now
that
you
really
find
it
in
vain
to
make
it
i
trust
that
you
will
accede
as
you
first
promised
to
do
and
not
seek
by
any
means
to
thwart
me
i
will
not
thwart
you
my
boy
although
in
my
opinion
you
ought
not
to
fight
with
a
vampyre
never
mind
that
we
cannot
urge
that
as
a
valid
excuse
so
long
as
he
chooses
to
deny
being
one
and
after
all
if
he
be
really
wrongfully
suspected
you
must
admit
that
he
is
a
very
injured
man
injured--nonsense
if
he
is
not
a
vampyre
he's
some
other
out-of-the-way
sort
of
fish
you
may
depend
he's
the
oddest-looking
fellow
ever
i
came
across
in
all
my
born
days
ashore
or
afloat
is
he
yes
he
is
and
yet
when
i
come
to
look
at
the
thing
again
in
my
mind
some
droll
sights
that
i
have
seen
come
across
my
memory
the
sea
is
the
place
for
wonders
and
for
mysteries
why
we
see
more
in
a
day
and
a
night
there
than
you
landsmen
could
contrive
to
make
a
whole
twelvemonth's
wonder
of
but
you
never
saw
a
vampyre
uncle
well
i
don't
know
that
i
didn't
know
anything
about
vampyres
till
i
came
here
but
that
was
my
ignorance
you
know
there
might
have
been
lots
of
vampyres
where
i've
been
for
all
i
know
oh
certainly
but
as
regards
this
duel
will
you
wait
now
until
to-morrow
morning
before
you
take
any
further
steps
in
the
matter
till
to-morrow
morning
yes
uncle
why
only
a
little
while
ago
you
were
all
eagerness
to
have
something
done
off-hand
just
so
but
now
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
waiting
until
to-morrow
morning
have
you
well
as
you
please
boy--as
you
please
have
everything
your
own
way
you
are
very
kind
uncle
and
now
i
have
another
favour
to
ask
of
you
what
is
it
why
you
know
that
henry
bannerworth
receives
but
a
very
small
sum
out
of
the
whole
proceeds
of
the
estate
here
which
ought
but
for
his
father's
extravagance
to
be
wholly
at
his
disposal
so
i
have
heard
i
am
certain
he
is
at
present
distressed
for
money
and
i
have
not
much
will
you
lend
me
fifty
pounds
uncle
until
my
own
affairs
are
sufficiently
arranged
to
enable
you
to
pay
yourself
again
will
i
of
course
i
will
i
wish
to
offer
that
sum
as
an
accommodation
to
henry
from
me
i
dare
say
he
will
receive
it
freely
because
he
must
be
convinced
how
freely
it
is
offered
and
besides
they
look
upon
me
now
almost
as
a
member
of
the
family
in
consequence
of
my
engagement
with
flora
certainly
and
quite
correct
too
there's
a
fifty-pound
note
my
boy
take
it
and
do
what
you
like
with
it
and
when
you
want
any
more
come
to
me
for
it
i
knew
i
could
trespass
thus
far
on
your
kindness
uncle
trespass
it's
no
trespass
at
all
well
we
will
not
fall
out
about
the
terms
in
which
i
cannot
help
expressing
my
gratitude
to
you
for
many
favours
to-morrow
you
will
arrange
the
duel
for
me
as
you
please
i
don't
altogether
like
going
to
that
fellow's
house
again
well
then
we
can
manage
i
dare
say
by
note
very
good
do
so
he
puts
me
in
mind
altogether
of
a
circumstance
that
happened
a
good
while
ago
when
i
was
at
sea
and
not
so
old
a
man
as
i
am
now
puts
you
in
mind
of
a
circumstance
uncle
yes
he's
something
like
a
fellow
that
figured
in
an
affair
that
i
know
a
good
deal
about
only
i
do
think
as
my
chap
was
more
mysterious
by
a
d----d
sight
than
this
one
indeed
oh
dear
yes
when
anything
happens
in
an
odd
way
at
sea
it
is
as
odd
again
as
anything
that
occurs
on
land
my
boy
you
may
depend
oh
you
only
fancy
that
uncle
because
you
have
spent
so
long
a
time
at
sea
no
i
don't
imagine
it
you
rascal
what
can
you
have
on
shore
equal
to
what
we
have
at
sea
why
the
sights
that
come
before
us
would
make
you
landsmen's
hairs
stand
up
on
end
and
never
come
down
again
in
the
ocean
do
you
mean
that
you
see
those
sights
uncle
to
be
sure
i
was
once
in
the
southern
ocean
in
a
small
frigate
looking
out
for
a
seventy-four
we
were
to
join
company
with
when
a
man
at
the
mast-head
sung
out
that
he
saw
her
on
the
larboard
bow
well
we
thought
it
was
all
right
enough
and
made
away
that
quarter
when
what
do
you
think
it
turned
out
to
be
i
really
cannot
say
the
head
of
a
fish
a
fish
yes
a
d----d
deal
bigger
than
the
hull
of
a
vessel
he
was
swimming
along
with
his
head
just
what
i
dare
say
he
considered
a
shaving
or
so
out
of
the
water
but
where
were
the
sails
uncle
the
sails
yes
your
man
at
the
mast-head
must
have
been
a
poor
seaman
not
to
have
missed
the
sails
all
that's
one
of
your
shore-going
ideas
now
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
i'll
tell
you
where
the
sails
were
master
charley
well
i
should
like
to
know
the
spray
then
that
he
dashed
up
with
a
pair
of
fins
that
were
close
to
his
head
was
in
such
a
quantity
and
so
white
that
they
looked
just
like
sails
oh
ah
you
may
say
'oh'
but
we
all
saw
him--the
whole
ship's
crew
and
we
sailed
alongside
of
him
for
some
time
till
he
got
tired
of
us
and
suddenly
dived
down
making
such
a
vortex
in
the
water
that
the
ship
shook
again
and
seemed
for
about
a
minute
as
if
she
was
inclined
to
follow
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
what
do
you
suppose
it
was
uncle
how
should
i
know
did
you
ever
see
it
again
never
though
others
have
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
now
and
then
in
the
same
ocean
but
never
came
so
near
him
as
we
did
that
ever
i
heard
of
at
all
events
they
may
have
done
so
it
is
singular
singular
or
not
it's
a
fool
to
what
i
can
tell
you
why
i've
seen
things
that
if
i
were
to
set
about
describing
them
to
you
you
would
say
i
was
making
up
a
romance
oh
no
it's
quite
impossible
uncle
any
one
could
ever
suspect
you
of
such
a
thing
you'd
believe
me
would
you
of
course
i
would
then
here
goes
i'll
just
tell
you
now
of
a
circumstance
that
i
haven't
liked
to
mention
to
anybody
yet
indeed
why
so
because
i
didn't
want
to
be
continually
fighting
people
for
not
believing
it
but
here
you
have
it--
we
were
outward
bound
a
good
ship
a
good
captain
and
good
messmates
you
know
go
far
towards
making
a
prosperous
voyage
a
pleasant
and
happy
one
and
on
this
occasion
we
had
every
reasonable
prospect
of
all
our
hands
were
all
tried
men--they
had
been
sailors
from
infancy
none
of
your
french
craft
that
serve
an
apprenticeship
and
then
become
land
lubbers
again
oh
no
they
were
stanch
and
true
and
loved
the
ocean
as
the
sluggard
loves
his
bed
or
the
lover
his
mistress
ay
and
for
the
matter
of
that
the
love
was
a
more
enduring
and
a
more
healthy
love
for
it
increased
with
years
and
made
men
love
one
another
and
they
would
stand
by
each
other
while
they
had
a
limb
to
lift--while
they
were
able
to
chew
a
quid
or
wink
an
eye
leave
alone
wag
a
pigtail
we
were
outward
bound
for
ceylon
with
cargo
and
were
to
bring
spices
and
other
matters
home
from
the
indian
market
the
ship
was
new
and
good--a
pretty
craft
she
sat
like
a
duck
upon
the
water
and
a
stiff
breeze
carried
her
along
the
surface
of
the
waves
without
your
rocking
and
pitching
and
tossing
like
an
old
wash-tub
at
a
mill-tail
as
i
have
had
the
misfortune
to
sail
in
more
than
once
afore
no
no
we
were
well
laden
and
well
pleased
and
weighed
anchor
with
light
hearts
and
a
hearty
cheer
away
we
went
down
the
river
and
soon
rounded
the
north
foreland
and
stood
out
in
the
channel
the
breeze
was
a
steady
and
stiff
one
and
carried
us
through
the
water
as
though
it
had
been
made
for
us
jack
said
i
to
a
messmate
of
mine
as
he
stood
looking
at
the
skies
then
at
the
sails
and
finally
at
the
water
with
a
graver
air
than
i
thought
was
at
all
consistent
with
the
occasion
or
circumstances
well
he
replied
what
ails
you
you
seem
as
melancholy
as
if
we
were
about
to
cast
lots
who
should
be
eaten
first
are
you
well
enough
i
am
hearty
enough
thank
heaven
he
said
but
i
don't
like
this
breeze
don't
like
the
breeze
said
i
why
mate
it
is
as
good
and
kind
a
breeze
as
ever
filled
a
sail
what
would
you
have
a
gale
no
no
i
fear
that
with
such
a
ship
and
such
a
set
of
hearty
able
seamen
i
think
we
could
manage
to
weather
out
the
stiffest
gale
that
ever
whistled
through
a
yard
that
may
be
i
hope
it
is
and
i
really
believe
and
think
so
then
what
makes
you
so
infernally
mopish
and
melancholy
i
don't
know
but
can't
help
it
it
seems
to
me
as
though
there
was
something
hanging
over
us
and
i
can't
tell
what
yes
there
are
the
colours
jack
at
the
masthead
they
are
flying
over
us
with
a
hearty
breeze
ah
ah
said
jack
looking
up
at
the
colours
and
then
went
away
without
saying
anything
more
for
he
had
some
piece
of
duty
to
perform
i
thought
my
messmate
had
something
on
his
mind
that
caused
him
to
feel
sad
and
uncomfortable
and
i
took
no
more
notice
of
it
indeed
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
he
was
as
merry
as
any
of
the
rest
and
had
no
more
melancholy
that
i
could
perceive
but
was
as
comfortable
as
anybody
we
had
a
gale
off
the
coast
of
biscay
and
rode
it
out
without
the
loss
of
a
spar
or
a
yard
indeed
without
the
slightest
accident
or
rent
of
any
kind
now
jack
what
do
you
think
of
our
vessel
said
i
she's
like
a
duck
upon
water
rises
and
falls
with
the
waves
and
doesn't
tumble
up
and
down
like
a
hoop
over
stones
no
no
she
goes
smoothly
and
sweetly
she
is
a
gallant
craft
and
this
is
her
first
voyage
and
i
predict
a
prosperous
one
i
hope
so
he
said
well
we
went
on
prosperously
enough
for
about
three
weeks
the
ocean
was
as
calm
and
as
smooth
as
a
meadow
the
breeze
light
but
good
and
we
stemmed
along
majestically
over
the
deep
blue
waters
and
passed
coast
after
coast
though
all
around
was
nothing
but
the
apparently
pathless
main
in
sight
a
better
sailer
i
never
stepped
into
said
the
captain
one
day
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
live
and
die
in
such
a
vessel
well
as
i
said
we
had
been
three
weeks
or
thereabouts
when
one
morning
after
the
sun
was
up
and
the
decks
washed
we
saw
a
strange
man
sitting
on
one
of
the
water-casks
that
were
on
deck
for
being
full
we
were
compelled
to
stow
some
of
them
on
deck
you
may
guess
those
on
deck
did
a
little
more
than
stare
at
this
strange
and
unexpected
apparition
by
jingo
i
never
saw
men
open
their
eyes
wider
in
all
my
life
nor
was
i
any
exception
to
the
rule
i
stared
as
well
i
might
but
we
said
nothing
for
some
minutes
and
the
stranger
looked
calmly
on
us
and
then
cocked
his
eye
with
a
nautical
air
up
at
the
sky
as
if
he
expected
to
receive
a
twopenny-post
letter
from
st
michael
or
a
billet
doux
from
the
virgin
mary
where
has
he
come
from
said
one
of
the
men
in
a
low
tone
to
his
companion
who
was
standing
by
him
at
that
moment
how
can
i
tell
replied
his
companion
he
may
have
dropped
from
the
clouds
he
seems
to
be
examining
the
road
perhaps
he
is
going
back
the
stranger
sat
all
this
time
with
the
most
extreme
and
provoking
coolness
and
unconcern
he
deigned
us
but
a
passing
notice
but
it
was
very
slight
he
was
a
tall
spare
man--what
is
termed
long
and
lathy--but
he
was
evidently
a
powerful
man
he
had
a
broad
chest
and
long
sinewy
arms
a
hooked
nose
and
a
black
eagle
eye
his
hair
was
curly
but
frosted
by
age
it
seemed
as
though
it
had
been
tinged
with
white
at
the
extremities
but
he
was
hale
and
active
otherwise
to
judge
from
appearances
notwithstanding
all
this
there
was
a
singular
repulsiveness
about
him
that
i
could
not
imagine
the
cause
or
describe
at
the
same
time
there
was
an
air
of
determination
in
his
wild
and
singular-looking
eyes
and
over
their
whole
there
was
decidedly
an
air
and
an
appearance
so
sinister
as
to
be
positively
disagreeable
well
said
i
after
we
had
stood
some
minutes
where
did
you
come
from
shipmate
he
looked
at
me
and
then
up
at
the
sky
in
a
knowing
manner
come
come
that
won't
do
you
have
none
of
peter
wilkins's
wings
and
couldn't
come
on
the
aerial
dodge
it
won't
do
how
did
you
get
here
he
gave
me
an
awful
wink
and
made
a
sort
of
involuntary
movement
which
jumped
him
up
a
few
inches
and
he
bumped
down
again
on
the
water-cask
that's
as
much
as
to
say
thought
i
that
he's
sat
himself
on
it
i'll
go
and
inform
the
captain
said
i
of
this
affair
he'll
hardly
believe
me
when
i
tell
him
i
am
sure
so
saying
i
left
the
deck
and
went
to
the
cabin
where
the
captain
was
at
breakfast
and
related
to
him
what
i
had
seen
respecting
the
stranger
the
captain
looked
at
me
with
an
air
of
disbelief
and
said--
what--do
you
mean
to
say
there's
a
man
on
board
we
haven't
seen
before
yes
i
do
captain
i
never
saw
him
afore
and
he's
sitting
beating
his
heels
on
the
water-cask
on
deck
the
devil
he
is
i
assure
you
sir
and
he
won't
answer
any
questions
i'll
see
to
that
i'll
see
if
i
can't
make
the
lubber
say
something
providing
his
tongue's
not
cut
out
but
how
came
he
on
board
confound
it
he
can't
be
the
devil
and
dropped
from
the
moon
don't
know
captain
said
i
he
is
evil-looking
enough
to
my
mind
to
be
the
father
of
evil
but
it's
ill
bespeaking
attentions
from
that
quarter
at
any
time
go
on
lad
i'll
come
up
after
you
i
left
the
cabin
and
i
heard
the
captain
coming
after
me
when
i
got
on
deck
i
saw
he
had
not
moved
from
the
place
where
i
left
him
there
was
a
general
commotion
among
the
crew
when
they
heard
of
the
occurrence
and
all
crowded
round
him
save
the
man
at
the
wheel
who
had
to
remain
at
his
post
the
captain
now
came
forward
and
the
men
fell
a
little
back
as
he
approached
for
a
moment
the
captain
stood
silent
attentively
examining
the
stranger
who
was
excessively
cool
and
stood
the
scrutiny
with
the
same
unconcern
that
he
would
had
the
captain
been
looking
at
his
watch
well
my
man
said
the
captain
how
did
you
come
here
i'm
part
of
the
cargo
he
said
with
an
indescribable
leer
part
of
the
cargo
be
d----d
said
the
captain
in
sudden
rage
for
he
thought
the
stranger
was
coming
his
jokes
too
strong
i
know
you
are
not
in
the
bills
of
lading
i'm
contraband
replied
the
stranger
and
my
uncle's
the
great
chain
of
tartary
the
captain
stared
as
well
he
might
and
did
not
speak
for
some
minutes
all
the
while
the
stranger
kept
kicking
his
heels
against
the
water-casks
and
squinting
up
at
the
skies
it
made
us
feel
very
queer
well
i
must
confess
you
are
not
in
the
regular
way
of
trading
oh
no
said
the
stranger
i
am
contraband--entirely
contraband
and
how
did
you
come
on
board
at
this
question
the
stranger
again
looked
curiously
up
at
the
skies
and
continued
to
do
so
for
more
than
a
minute
he
then
turned
his
gaze
upon
the
captain
no
no
said
the
captain
eloquent
dumb
show
won't
do
with
me
you
didn't
come
like
mother
shipton
upon
a
birch
broom
how
did
you
come
on
board
my
vessel
i
walked
on
board
said
the
stranger
you
walked
on
board
and
where
did
you
conceal
yourself
below
very
good
and
why
didn't
you
stay
below
altogether
because
i
wanted
fresh
air
i'm
in
a
delicate
state
of
health
you
see
it
doesn't
do
to
stay
in
a
confined
place
too
long
confound
the
binnacle
said
the
captain
it
was
his
usual
oath
when
anything
bothered
him
and
he
could
not
make
it
out
confound
the
binnacle--what
a
delicate-looking
animal
you
are
i
wish
you
had
stayed
where
you
were
your
delicacy
would
have
been
all
the
same
to
me
delicate
indeed
yes
very
said
the
stranger
coolly
there
was
something
so
comic
in
the
assertion
of
his
delicateness
of
health
that
we
should
all
have
laughed
but
we
were
somewhat
scared
and
had
not
the
inclination
how
have
you
lived
since
you
came
on
board
inquired
the
captain
very
indifferently
but
how
what
have
you
eaten
and
what
have
you
drank
nothing
i
assure
you
all
i
did
while
was
below
was--
what
why
i
sucked
my
thumbs
like
a
polar
bear
in
its
winter
quarters
and
as
he
spoke
the
stranger
put
his
two
thumbs
into
his
mouth
and
extraordinary
thumbs
they
were
too
for
each
would
have
filled
an
ordinary
man's
mouth
these
said
the
stranger
pulling
them
out
and
gazing
at
them
wistfully
and
with
a
deep
sigh
he
continued--
these
were
thumbs
at
one
time
but
they
are
nothing
now
to
what
they
were
confound
the
binnacle
muttered
the
captain
to
himself
and
then
he
added
aloud--
it's
cheap
living
however
but
where
are
you
going
to
and
why
did
you
come
aboard
i
wanted
a
cheap
cruise
and
i
am
going
there
and
back
why
that's
where
we
are
going
said
the
captain
then
we
are
brothers
exclaimed
the
stranger
hopping
off
the
water-cask
like
a
kangaroo
and
bounding
towards
the
captain
holding
out
his
hand
as
though
he
would
have
shaken
hands
with
him
no
no
said
the
captain
i
can't
do
it
can't
do
it
exclaimed
the
stranger
angrily
what
do
you
mean
that
i
can't
have
anything
to
do
with
contraband
articles
i
am
a
fair
trader
and
do
all
above
board
i
haven't
a
chaplain
on
board
or
he
should
offer
up
prayers
for
your
preservation
and
the
recovery
of
your
health
which
seems
so
delicate
that
be--
the
stranger
didn't
finish
the
sentence
he
merely
screwed
his
mouth
up
into
an
incomprehensible
shape
and
puffed
out
a
lot
of
breath
with
some
force
and
which
sounded
very
much
like
a
whistle
but
oh
what
thick
breath
he
had
it
was
as
much
like
smoke
as
anything
i
ever
saw
and
so
my
shipmate
said
i
say
captain
said
the
stranger
as
he
saw
him
pacing
the
deck
well
just
send
me
up
some
beef
and
biscuit
and
some
coffee
royal--be
sure
it's
royal
do
you
hear
because
i'm
partial
to
brandy
it's
the
only
good
thing
there
is
on
earth
i
shall
not
easily
forget
the
captain's
look
as
he
turned
towards
the
stranger
and
gave
his
huge
shoulders
a
shrug
as
much
as
to
say--
well
i
can't
help
it
now
he's
here
and
i
can't
throw
him
overboard
the
coffee
beef
and
biscuit
were
sent
him
and
the
stranger
seemed
to
eat
them
with
great
gout
and
drank
the
coffee
with
much
relish
and
returned
the
things
saying
your
captain
is
an
excellent
cook
give
him
my
compliments
i
thought
the
captain
would
think
that
was
but
a
left-handed
compliment
and
look
more
angry
than
pleased
but
no
notice
was
taken
of
it
it
was
strange
but
this
man
had
impressed
upon
all
in
the
vessel
some
singular
notion
of
his
being
more
than
he
should
be--more
than
a
mere
mortal
and
not
one
endeavoured
to
interfere
with
him
the
captain
was
a
stout
and
dare-devil
a
fellow
as
you
would
well
met
with
yet
he
seemed
tacitly
to
acknowledge
more
than
he
would
say
for
he
never
after
took
any
further
notice
of
the
stranger
nor
he
of
him
they
had
barely
any
conversation
simply
a
civil
word
when
they
first
met
and
so
forth
but
there
was
little
or
no
conversation
of
any
kind
between
them
the
stranger
slept
upon
deck
and
lived
upon
deck
entirely
he
never
once
went
below
after
we
saw
him
and
his
own
account
of
being
below
so
long
this
was
very
well
but
the
night-watch
did
not
enjoy
his
society
and
would
have
willingly
dispensed
with
it
at
that
hour
so
particularly
lonely
and
dejected
upon
the
broad
ocean
and
perhaps
a
thousand
miles
away
from
the
nearest
point
of
land
at
this
dread
and
lonely
hour
when
no
sound
reaches
the
ear
and
disturbs
the
wrapt
stillness
of
the
night
save
the
whistling
of
the
wind
through
the
cordage
or
an
occasional
dash
of
water
against
the
vessel's
side
the
thoughts
of
the
sailor
are
fixed
on
far
distant
objects--his
own
native
land
and
the
friends
and
loved
ones
he
has
left
behind
him
he
then
thinks
of
the
wilderness
before
behind
and
around
him
of
the
immense
body
of
water
almost
in
places
bottomless
gazing
upon
such
a
scene
and
with
thoughts
as
strange
and
indefinite
as
the
very
boundless
expanse
before
him
it
is
no
wonder
if
he
should
become
superstitious
the
time
and
place
would
indeed
unbidden
conjure
up
thoughts
and
feelings
of
a
fearful
character
and
intensity
the
stranger
at
such
times
would
occupy
his
favourite
seat
on
the
water
cask
and
looking
up
at
the
sky
and
then
on
the
ocean
and
between
whiles
he
would
whistle
a
strange
wild
unknown
melody
the
flesh
of
the
sailors
used
to
creep
up
in
knots
and
bumps
when
they
heard
it
the
wind
used
to
whistle
as
an
accompaniment
and
pronounce
fearful
sounds
to
their
ears
the
wind
had
been
highly
favourable
from
the
first
and
since
the
stranger
had
been
discovered
it
had
blown
fresh
and
we
went
along
at
a
rapid
rate
stemming
the
water
and
dashing
the
spray
off
from
the
bows
and
cutting
the
water
like
a
shark
this
was
very
singular
to
us
we
couldn't
understand
it
neither
could
the
captain
and
we
looked
very
suspiciously
at
the
stranger
and
wished
him
at
the
bottom
for
the
freshness
of
the
wind
now
became
a
gale
and
yet
the
ship
came
through
the
water
steadily
and
away
we
went
before
the
wind
as
if
the
devil
drove
us
and
mind
i
don't
mean
to
say
he
didn't
the
gale
increased
to
a
hurricane
and
though
we
had
not
a
stitch
of
canvass
out
yet
we
drove
before
the
gale
as
if
we
had
been
shot
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
gun
the
stranger
still
sat
on
the
water
casks
and
all
night
long
he
kept
up
his
infernal
whistle
now
sailors
don't
like
to
hear
any
one
whistle
when
there's
such
a
gale
blowing
over
their
heads--it's
like
asking
for
more
but
he
would
persist
and
the
louder
and
stronger
the
wind
blew
the
louder
he
whistled
at
length
there
came
a
storm
of
rain
lightning
and
wind
we
were
tossed
mountains
high
and
the
foam
rose
over
the
vessel
and
often
entirely
over
our
heads
and
the
men
were
lashed
to
their
posts
to
prevent
being
washed
away
but
the
stranger
still
lay
on
the
water
casks
kicking
his
heels
and
whistling
his
infernal
tune
always
the
same
he
wasn't
washed
away
nor
moved
by
the
action
of
the
water
indeed
we
heartily
hoped
and
expected
to
see
both
him
and
the
water
cask
floated
overboard
at
every
minute
but
as
the
captain
said--
confound
the
binnacle
the
old
water
tub
seems
as
if
it
were
screwed
on
to
the
deck
and
won't
move
off
and
he
on
the
top
of
it
there
was
a
strong
inclination
to
throw
him
overboard
and
the
men
conversed
in
low
whispers
and
came
round
the
captain
saying--
we
have
come
captain
to
ask
you
what
you
think
of
this
strange
man
who
has
come
so
mysteriously
on
board
i
can't
tell
what
to
think
lads
he's
past
thinking
about--he's
something
above
my
comprehension
altogether
i
promise
you
well
then
we
are
thinking
much
of
the
same
thing
captain
what
do
you
mean
that
he
ain't
exactly
one
of
our
sort
no
he's
no
sailor
certainly
and
yet
for
a
land
lubber
he's
about
as
rum
a
customer
as
ever
i
met
with
so
he
is
sir
he
stands
salt
water
well
and
i
must
say
that
i
couldn't
lay
a
top
of
those
water
casks
in
that
style
very
well
nor
nobody
amongst
us
sir
well
then
he's
in
nobody's
way
it
he--nobody
wants
to
take
his
berth
i
suppose
the
men
looked
at
each
other
somewhat
blank
they
didn't
understand
the
meaning
at
all--far
from
it
and
the
idea
of
any
one's
wanting
to
take
the
stranger's
place
on
the
water
casks
was
so
outrageously
ludicrous
that
at
any
other
time
they
would
have
considered
it
a
devilish
good
joke
and
have
never
ceased
laughing
at
it
he
paused
some
minutes
and
then
one
of
them
said--
it
isn't
that
we
envy
him
his
berth
captain
'cause
nobody
else
could
live
there
for
a
moment
any
one
amongst
us
that
had
been
there
would
have
been
washed
overboard
a
thousand
times
over
so
they
would
said
the
captain
well
sir
he's
more
than
us
very
likely
but
how
can
i
help
that
we
think
he's
the
main
cause
of
all
this
racket
in
the
heavens--the
storm
and
hurricane
and
that
in
short
if
he
remains
much
longer
we
shall
all
sink
i
am
sorry
for
it
i
don't
think
we
are
in
any
danger
and
had
the
strange
being
any
power
to
prevent
it
he
would
assuredly
do
so
lest
he
got
drowned
but
we
think
if
he
were
thrown
overboard
all
would
be
well
indeed
yes
captain
you
may
depend
upon
it
he's
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
throw
him
overboard
and
that's
all
we
want
i
shall
not
throw
him
overboard
even
if
i
could
do
such
a
thing
and
i
am
by
no
means
sure
of
anything
of
the
kind
we
do
not
ask
it
sir
what
do
you
desire
leave
to
throw
him
overboard--it
is
to
save
our
own
lives
i
can't
let
you
do
any
such
thing
he's
in
nobody's
way
but
he's
always
a
whistling
only
hark
now
and
in
such
a
hurricane
as
this
it
is
dreadful
to
think
of
it
what
else
can
we
do
sir--he's
not
human
at
this
moment
the
stranger's
whistling
came
clear
upon
their
ears
there
was
the
same
wild
unearthly
notes
as
before
but
the
cadences
were
stronger
and
there
was
a
supernatural
clearness
in
all
the
tones
there
now
said
another
he's
kicking
the
water
cask
with
his
heels
confound
the
binnacle
said
the
captain
it
sounds
like
short
peals
of
thunder
go
and
talk
to
him
lads
and
if
that
won't
do
sir
may
we--
don't
ask
me
any
questions
i
don't
think
a
score
of
the
best
men
that
were
ever
born
could
move
him
i
don't
mind
trying
said
one
upon
this
the
whole
of
the
men
moved
to
the
spot
where
the
water
casks
were
standing
and
the
stranger
lay
there
was
he
whistling
like
fury
and
at
the
same
time
beating
his
heels
to
the
tune
against
the
empty
casks
we
came
up
to
him
and
he
took
no
notice
of
us
at
all
but
kept
on
in
the
same
way
hilloa
shouted
one
hilloa
shouted
another
no
notice
however
was
taken
of
us
and
one
of
our
number
a
big
herculean
fellow
an
irishman
seized
him
by
the
leg
either
to
make
him
get
up
or
as
we
thought
to
give
him
a
lift
over
our
heads
into
the
sea
however
he
had
scarcely
got
his
fingers
round
the
calf
of
the
leg
when
the
stranger
pinched
his
leg
so
tight
against
the
water
cask
that
he
could
not
move
and
was
as
effectually
pinned
as
if
he
had
been
nailed
there
the
stranger
after
he
had
finished
a
bar
of
the
music
rose
gradually
to
a
sitting
posture
and
without
the
aid
of
his
hands
and
looking
the
unlucky
fellow
in
the
face
he
said--
well
what
do
you
want
my
hand
said
the
fellow
take
it
then
he
said
he
did
take
it
and
we
saw
that
there
was
blood
on
it
the
stranger
stretched
out
his
left
hand
and
taking
him
by
the
breech
he
lifted
him
without
any
effort
upon
the
water-cask
beside
him
we
all
stared
at
this
and
couldn't
help
it
and
we
were
quite
convinced
we
could
not
throw
him
overboard
but
he
would
probably
have
no
difficulty
in
throwing
us
overboard
well
what
do
you
want
he
again
exclaimed
to
us
all
we
looked
at
one
another
and
had
scarce
courage
to
speak
at
length
i
said--
we
wish
you
to
leave
off
whistling
leave
off
whistling
he
said
and
why
should
i
do
anything
of
the
kind
because
it
brings
the
wind
ha
ha
why
that's
the
very
reason
i
am
whistling
to
bring
the
wind
but
we
don't
want
so
much
pho
pho
you
don't
know
what's
good
for
you--it's
a
beautiful
breeze
and
not
a
bit
too
stiff
it's
a
hurricane
nonsense
but
it
is
now
you
see
how
i'll
prove
you
are
wrong
in
a
minute
you
see
my
hair
don't
you
he
said
after
he
took
off
his
cap
very
well
look
now
he
got
up
on
the
water-cask
and
stood
bolt
upright
and
running
his
fingers
through
his
hair
made
it
all
stand
straight
on
end
confound
the
binnacle
said
the
captain
if
ever
i
saw
the
like
there
said
the
stranger
triumphantly
don't
tell
me
there's
any
wind
to
signify
don't
you
see
it
doesn't
even
move
one
of
my
grey
hairs
and
if
it
blew
as
hard
as
you
say
i
am
certain
it
would
move
a
hair
confound
the
binnacle
muttered
the
captain
as
he
walked
away
d--n
the
cabouse
if
he
ain't
older
than
i
am--he's
too
many
for
me
and
everybody
else
are
you
satisfied
what
could
we
say--we
turned
away
and
left
the
place
and
stood
at
our
quarters--there
was
no
help
for
it--we
were
impelled
to
grin
and
abide
by
it
illustration
as
soon
as
we
had
left
the
place
he
put
his
cap
on
again
and
sat
down
on
the
water-casks
and
then
took
leave
of
his
prisoner
whom
he
set
free
and
there
lay
at
full
length
on
his
back
with
his
legs
hanging
down
once
more
he
began
to
whistle
most
furiously
and
beat
time
with
his
feet
for
full
three
weeks
did
he
continue
at
this
game
night
and
day
without
any
interruption
save
such
as
he
required
to
consume
enough
coffee
royal
junk
and
biscuit
as
would
have
served
three
hearty
men
well
about
that
time
one
night
the
whistling
ceased
and
he
began
to
sing--oh
it
was
singing--such
a
voice
gog
and
magog
in
guildhall
london
when
they
spoke
were
nothing
to
him--it
was
awful
but
the
wind
calmed
down
to
a
fresh
and
stiff
breeze
he
continued
at
this
game
for
three
whole
days
and
nights
and
on
the
fourth
it
ceased
and
when
we
went
to
take
his
coffee
royal
to
him
he
was
gone
we
hunted
about
everywhere
but
he
was
entirely
gone
and
in
three
weeks
after
we
safely
cast
anchor
having
performed
our
voyage
in
a
good
month
under
the
usual
time
and
had
it
been
an
old
vessel
she
would
have
leaked
and
stinted
like
a
tub
from
the
straining
however
we
were
glad
enough
to
get
in
and
were
curiously
inquisitive
as
to
what
was
put
in
our
vessel
to
come
back
with
for
as
the
captain
said--
confound
the
binnacle
i'll
have
no
more
contraband
articles
if
i
can
help
it
the
meeting
by
moonlight
in
the
park--the
turret
window
in
the
hall--the
letters
illustration
the
old
admiral
showed
such
a
strong
disposition
to
take
offence
at
charles
if
he
should
presume
for
a
moment
to
doubt
the
truth
of
the
narrative
that
was
thus
communicated
to
him
that
the
latter
would
not
anger
him
by
so
doing
but
confined
his
observations
upon
it
to
saying
that
he
considered
it
was
very
wonderful
and
very
extraordinary
and
so
on
which
very
well
satisfied
the
old
man
the
day
was
now
however
getting
far
advanced
and
charles
holland
began
to
think
of
his
engagement
with
the
vampyre
he
read
and
read
the
letter
over
and
over
again
but
he
could
not
come
to
a
correct
conclusion
as
to
whether
it
intended
to
imply
that
he
sir
francis
varney
would
wish
to
fight
him
at
the
hour
and
place
mentioned
or
merely
give
him
a
meeting
as
a
preliminary
step
he
was
rather
on
the
whole
inclined
to
think
that
some
explanation
would
be
offered
by
varney
but
at
all
events
he
persevered
in
his
determination
of
going
well
armed
lest
anything
in
the
shape
of
treachery
should
be
intended
as
nothing
of
any
importance
occurred
now
in
the
interval
of
time
till
nearly
midnight
we
will
at
once
step
to
that
time
and
our
readers
will
suppose
it
to
be
a
quarter
to
twelve
o'clock
at
night
and
young
charles
holland
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
house
to
keep
his
appointment
by
the
pollard
oak
with
the
mysterious
sir
francis
varney
he
placed
his
loaded
pistols
conveniently
in
his
pocket
so
that
at
a
moment's
notice
he
could
lay
hands
on
them
and
then
wrapping
himself
up
in
a
travelling
cloak
he
had
brought
with
him
to
bannerworth
hall
he
prepared
to
leave
his
chamber
the
moon
still
shone
although
now
somewhat
on
the
wane
and
although
there
were
certainly
many
clouds
in
the
sky
they
were
but
of
a
light
fleecy
character
and
very
little
interrupted
the
rays
of
light
that
came
from
the
nearly
full
disc
of
the
moon
from
his
window
he
could
not
perceive
the
spot
in
the
park
where
he
was
to
meet
varney
because
the
room
in
which
he
was
occupied
not
a
sufficiently
high
place
in
the
house
to
enable
him
to
look
over
a
belt
of
trees
that
stopped
the
view
from
almost
any
of
the
upper
windows
the
pollard
oak
could
be
seen
it
so
happened
now
that
the
admiral
had
been
placed
in
a
room
immediately
above
the
one
occupied
by
his
nephew
and
as
his
mind
was
full
of
how
he
should
manage
with
regard
to
arranging
the
preliminaries
of
the
duel
between
charles
and
varney
on
the
morrow
he
found
it
difficult
to
sleep
and
after
remaining
in
bed
about
twenty
minutes
and
finding
that
each
moment
he
was
only
getting
more
and
more
restless
he
adopted
a
course
which
he
always
did
under
such
circumstances
he
rose
and
dressed
himself
again
intending
to
sit
up
for
an
hour
and
then
turn
into
bed
and
try
a
second
time
to
get
to
sleep
but
he
had
no
means
of
getting
a
light
so
he
drew
the
heavy
curtain
from
before
the
window
and
let
in
as
much
of
the
moonlight
as
he
could
this
window
commanded
a
most
beautiful
and
extensive
view
for
from
it
the
eye
could
carry
completely
over
the
tops
of
the
tallest
trees
so
that
there
was
no
interruption
whatever
to
the
prospect
which
was
as
extensive
as
it
was
delightful
even
the
admiral
who
never
would
confess
to
seeing
much
beauty
in
scenery
where
water
formed
not
a
large
portion
of
it
could
not
resist
opening
his
window
and
looking
out
with
a
considerable
degree
of
admiration
upon
wood
and
dale
as
they
were
illuminated
by
the
moon's
rays
softened
and
rendered
if
anything
more
beautiful
by
the
light
vapours
through
which
they
had
to
struggle
to
make
their
way
charles
holland
in
order
to
avoid
the
likelihood
of
meeting
with
any
one
who
would
question
him
as
to
where
he
was
going
determined
upon
leaving
his
room
by
the
balcony
which
as
we
are
aware
presented
ample
facilities
for
his
so
doing
he
cast
a
glance
at
the
portrait
in
the
panel
before
he
left
the
apartment
and
then
saying--
for
you
dear
flora
for
you
i
essay
this
meeting
with
the
fearful
original
of
that
portrait
he
immediately
opened
his
window
and
stepped
out
on
to
the
balcony
young
and
active
as
was
charles
holland
to
descend
from
that
balcony
presented
to
him
no
difficulty
whatever
and
he
was
in
a
very
few
moments
safe
in
the
garden
of
bannerworth
hall
he
never
thought
for
a
moment
to
look
up
or
he
would
in
an
instant
have
seen
the
white
head
of
his
old
uncle
as
it
was
projected
over
the
sill
of
the
window
of
his
chamber
the
drop
of
charles
from
the
balcony
of
his
window
just
made
sufficient
noise
to
attract
the
admiral's
attention
and
then
before
he
could
think
of
making
any
alarm
he
saw
charles
walking
hastily
across
a
grass
plot
which
was
sufficiently
in
the
light
of
the
moon
to
enable
the
admiral
at
once
to
recognise
him
and
leave
no
sort
of
doubt
as
to
his
positive
identity
of
course
upon
discovering
that
it
was
charles
the
necessity
for
making
an
alarm
no
longer
existed
and
indeed
not
knowing
what
it
was
that
had
induced
him
to
leave
his
chamber
a
moment's
reflection
suggested
to
him
the
propriety
of
not
even
calling
to
charles
lest
he
should
defeat
some
discovery
which
he
might
be
about
to
make
he
has
heard
something
or
seen
something
thought
the
admiral
and
is
gone
to
find
out
what
it
is
i
only
wish
i
was
with
him
but
up
here
i
can
do
nothing
at
all
that's
quite
clear
charles
he
saw
walked
very
rapidly
and
like
a
man
who
has
some
fixed
destination
which
he
wishes
to
reach
as
quickly
as
possible
when
he
dived
among
the
trees
which
skirted
one
side
of
the
flower
gardens
the
admiral
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
and
he
said--
now
where
on
earth
is
he
off
to
he
is
fully
dressed
and
has
his
cloak
about
him
after
a
few
moments'
reflection
he
decided
that
having
seen
something
suspicious
charles
must
have
got
up
and
dressed
himself
to
fathom
it
the
moment
this
idea
became
fairly
impressed
upon
his
mind
he
left
his
bedroom
and
descended
to
where
one
of
the
brothers
he
knew
was
sitting
up
keeping
watch
during
the
night
it
was
henry
who
was
so
on
guard
and
when
the
admiral
came
into
the
room
he
uttered
an
expression
of
surprise
to
find
him
up
for
it
was
now
some
time
past
twelve
o'clock
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
charles
has
left
the
house
said
the
admiral
left
the
house
yes
i
saw
him
just
now
go
across
the
garden
and
you
are
sure
it
was
he
quite
sure
i
saw
him
by
the
moonlight
cross
the
green
plot
then
you
may
depend
he
has
seen
or
heard
something
and
gone
alone
to
find
out
what
it
is
rather
than
give
any
alarm
that
is
just
what
i
think
it
must
be
so
i
will
follow
him
if
you
can
show
me
exactly
which
way
he
went
that
i
can
easily
and
in
case
i
should
have
made
any
mistake
which
it
is
not
at
all
likely
we
can
go
to
his
room
first
and
see
if
it
is
empty
a
good
thought
certainly
that
will
at
once
put
an
end
to
all
doubt
upon
the
question
they
both
immediately
proceeded
to
charles's
room
and
then
the
admiral's
accuracy
of
identification
of
his
nephew
was
immediately
proved
by
finding
that
charles
was
not
there
and
that
the
window
was
wide
open
you
see
i
am
right
said
the
admiral
you
are
cried
henry
but
what
have
we
here
where
here
on
the
dressing-table
here
are
no
less
than
three
letters
all
laid
as
it
on
purpose
to
catch
the
eye
of
the
first
one
who
might
enter
the
room
indeed
you
perceive
them
henry
held
them
to
the
light
and
after
a
moment's
inspection
of
them
he
said
in
a
voice
of
much
surprise--
good
god
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
the
meaning
of
what
the
letters
are
addressed
to
parties
in
the
house
here
do
you
not
see
to
whom
one
to
admiral
bell--
the
deuce
another
to
me
and
the
third
to
my
sister
flora
there
is
some
new
mystery
here
the
admiral
looked
at
the
superscription
of
one
of
the
letters
which
was
handed
to
him
in
silent
amazement
then
he
cried--
set
down
the
light
and
let
us
read
them
henry
did
so
and
then
they
simultaneously
opened
the
epistles
which
were
severally
addressed
to
them
there
was
a
silence
as
of
the
very
grave
for
some
moments
and
then
the
old
admiral
staggered
to
a
seat
as
he
exclaimed--
am
i
dreaming--am
i
dreaming
is
this
possible
said
henry
in
a
voice
of
deep
emotion
as
he
allowed
the
note
addressed
to
him
to
drop
on
to
the
floor
d--n
it
what
does
yours
say
cried
the
old
admiral
in
a
louder
tone
read
it--what
says
yours
read
it--i'm
amazed
the
letters
were
exchanged
and
read
by
each
with
the
same
breathless
attention
they
had
bestowed
upon
their
own
after
which
they
both
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
pictures
of
amazement
and
the
most
absolute
state
of
bewilderment
not
to
keep
our
readers
in
suspense
we
at
once
transcribe
each
of
these
letters
the
one
to
the
admiral
contained
these
words--
my
dear
uncle
of
course
you
will
perceive
the
prudence
of
keeping
this
letter
to
yourself
but
the
fact
is
i
have
now
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
bannerworth
hall
flora
bannerworth
is
not
now
the
person
she
was
when
first
i
knew
her
and
loved
her
such
being
the
case
and
she
having
altered
not
i
she
cannot
accuse
me
of
fickleness
i
still
love
the
flora
bannerworth
i
first
knew
but
i
cannot
make
my
wife
one
who
is
subject
to
the
visitations
of
a
vampyre
i
have
remained
here
long
enough
now
to
satisfy
myself
that
this
vampyre
business
is
no
delusion
i
am
quite
convinced
that
it
is
a
positive
fact
and
that
after
death
flora
will
herself
become
one
of
the
horrible
existences
known
by
that
name
i
will
communicate
to
you
from
the
first
large
city
on
the
continent
whither
i
am
going
at
which
i
make
any
stay
and
in
the
meantime
make
what
excuses
you
like
at
bannerworth
hall
which
i
advise
you
to
leave
as
quickly
as
you
can
and
believe
me
to
be
my
dear
uncle
yours
truly
charles
holland
henry's
letter
was
this--
my
dear
sir
if
you
calmly
and
dispassionately
consider
the
painful
and
distressing
circumstances
in
which
your
family
are
placed
i
am
sure
that
far
from
blaming
me
for
the
step
which
this
note
will
announce
to
you
i
have
taken
you
will
be
the
first
to
give
me
credit
for
acting
with
an
amount
of
prudence
and
foresight
which
was
highly
necessary
under
the
circumstances
if
the
supposed
visits
of
a
vampyre
to
your
sister
flora
had
turned
out
as
first
i
hoped
they
would
a
delusion
and
been
in
any
satisfactory
manner
explained
away
i
should
certainly
have
felt
pride
and
pleasure
in
fulfilling
my
engagement
to
that
young
lady
you
must
however
yourself
feel
that
the
amount
of
evidence
in
favour
of
a
belief
that
an
actual
vampyre
has
visited
flora
enforces
a
conviction
of
its
truth
i
cannot
therefore
make
her
my
wife
under
such
very
singular
circumstances
perhaps
you
may
blame
me
for
not
taking
at
once
advantage
of
the
permission
given
me
to
forego
my
engagement
when
first
i
came
to
your
house
but
the
fact
is
i
did
not
then
in
the
least
believe
in
the
existence
of
the
vampyre
but
since
a
positive
conviction
of
that
most
painful
fact
has
now
forced
itself
upon
me
i
beg
to
decline
the
honour
of
an
alliance
which
i
had
at
one
time
looked
forward
to
with
the
most
considerable
satisfaction
i
shall
be
on
the
continent
as
fast
as
conveyances
can
take
me
therefore
should
you
entertain
any
romantic
notions
of
calling
me
to
an
account
for
a
course
of
proceeding
i
think
perfectly
and
fully
justifiable
you
will
not
find
me
accept
the
assurances
of
my
respect
for
yourself
and
pity
for
your
sister
and
believe
me
to
be
my
dear
sir
your
sincere
friend
charles
holland
these
two
letters
might
well
make
the
admiral
stare
at
henry
bannerworth
and
henry
stare
at
him
an
occurrence
so
utterly
and
entirely
unexpected
by
both
of
them
was
enough
to
make
them
doubt
the
evidence
of
their
own
senses
but
there
were
the
letters
as
a
damning
evidence
of
the
outrageous
fact
and
charles
holland
was
gone
it
was
the
admiral
who
first
recovered
from
the
stunning
effect
of
the
epistles
and
he
with
a
gesture
of
perfect
fury
exclaimed--
the
scoundrel--the
cold-blooded
villain
i
renounce
him
for
ever
he
is
no
nephew
of
mine
he
is
some
d----d
imposter
nobody
with
a
dash
of
my
family
blood
in
his
veins
would
have
acted
so
to
save
himself
from
a
thousand
deaths
who
shall
we
trust
now
said
henry
when
those
whom
we
take
to
our
inmost
hearts
deceive
us
thus
this
is
the
greatest
shock
i
have
yet
received
if
there
be
a
pang
greater
than
another
surely
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
faithlessness
and
heartlessness
of
one
we
loved
and
trusted
he
is
a
scoundrel
roared
the
admiral
d--n
him
he'll
die
on
a
dunghill
and
that's
too
good
a
place
for
him
i
cast
him
off--i'll
find
him
out
and
old
as
i
am
i'll
fight
him--i'll
wring
his
neck
the
rascal
and
as
for
poor
dear
miss
flora
god
bless
her
i'll--i'll
marry
her
myself
and
make
her
an
admiral--i'll
marry
her
myself
oh
that
i
should
be
uncle
to
such
a
rascal
calm
yourself
said
henry
no
one
can
blame
you
yes
you
can
i
had
no
right
to
be
his
uncle
and
i
was
an
old
fool
to
love
him
the
old
man
sat
down
and
his
voice
became
broken
with
emotion
as
he
said--
sir
i
tell
you
i
would
have
died
willingly
rather
than
this
should
have
happened
this
will
kill
me
now--i
shall
die
now
of
shame
and
grief
tears
gushed
from
the
admiral's
eyes
and
the
sight
of
the
noble
old
man's
emotion
did
much
to
calm
the
anger
of
henry
which
although
he
said
but
little
was
boiling
at
his
heart
like
a
volcano
admiral
bell
he
said
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
business
we
can
not
blame
you
for
the
heartlessness
of
another
i
have
but
one
favour
to
ask
of
you
what--what
can
i
do
say
no
more
about
him
at
all
i
can't
help
saying
something
about
him
you
ought
to
turn
me
out
of
the
house
heaven
forbid
what
for
because
i'm
his
uncle--his
d----d
old
fool
of
an
uncle
that
always
thought
so
much
of
him
nay
my
good
sir
that
was
a
fault
on
the
right
side
and
cannot
discredit
you
i
thought
him
the
most
perfect
of
human
beings
oh
if
i
could
but
have
guessed
this
it
was
impossible
such
duplicity
never
was
equalled
in
this
world--it
was
impossible
to
foresee
it
hold--hold
did
he
give
you
fifty
pounds
what
did
he
give
you
fifty
pounds
give
me
fifty
pounds
most
decidedly
not
what
made
you
think
of
such
a
thing
because
to-day
he
borrowed
fifty
pounds
of
me
he
said
to
lend
to
you
i
never
heard
of
the
transaction
until
this
moment
the
villain
no
doubt
sir
he
wanted
that
amount
to
expedite
his
progress
abroad
well
now
damme
if
an
angel
had
come
to
me
and
said
'hilloa
admiral
bell
your
nephew
charles
holland
is
a
thundering
rogue'
i
should
have
said
'you're
a
liar'
this
is
fighting
against
facts
my
dear
sir
he
is
gone--mention
him
no
more
forget
him
as
i
shall
endeavour
myself
to
do
and
persuade
my
poor
sister
to
do
poor
girl
what
can
we
say
to
her
nothing
but
give
her
all
the
letters
and
let
her
be
at
once
satisfied
of
the
worthlessness
of
him
she
loved
the
best
way
her
woman's
pride
will
then
come
to
her
help
i
hope
it
will
she
is
of
an
honourable
race
and
i
am
sure
she
will
not
condescend
to
shed
a
tear
for
such
a
man
as
charles
holland
has
proved
himself
to
be
d--n
him
i'll
find
him
out
and
make
him
fight
you
he
shall
give
you
satisfaction
no
no
no
but
he
shall
i
cannot
fight
with
him
you
cannot
certainly
not
he
is
too
far
beneath
me
now
i
cannot
fight
on
honourable
terms
with
one
whom
i
despise
as
too
dishonourable
to
contend
with
i
have
nothing
now
but
silence
and
contempt
i
have
though
for
i'll
break
his
neck
when
i
see
him
or
he
shall
break
mine
the
villain
i'm
ashamed
to
stay
here
my
young
friend
how
mistaken
a
view
you
take
of
this
matter
my
dear
sir
as
admiral
bell
a
gentleman
a
brave
officer
and
a
man
of
the
purest
and
most
unblemished
honour
you
confer
a
distinction
upon
us
by
your
presence
here
the
admiral
wrung
henry
by
the
hand
as
he
said--
to-morrow--wait
till
to-morrow
we
will
talk
over
this
matter
to
morrow--i
cannot
to-night
i
have
not
patience
but
to-morrow
my
dear
boy
we
will
have
it
all
out
god
bless
you
good
night
the
noble
confidence
of
flora
bannerworth
in
her
lover--her
opinion
of
the
three
letters--the
admiral's
admiration
illustration
to
describe
the
feelings
of
henry
bannerworth
on
the
occasion
of
this
apparent
defalcation
from
the
path
of
rectitude
and
honour
by
his
friend
as
he
had
fondly
imagined
charles
holland
to
be
would
be
next
to
impossible
if
as
we
have
taken
occasion
to
say
it
be
a
positive
fact
that
a
noble
and
a
generous
mind
feels
more
acutely
any
heartlessness
of
this
description
from
one
on
whom
it
has
placed
implicit
confidence
than
the
most
deliberate
and
wicked
of
injuries
from
absolute
strangers
we
can
easily
conceive
that
henry
bannerworth
was
precisely
the
person
to
feel
most
acutely
the
conduct
which
all
circumstances
appeared
to
fix
upon
charles
holland
upon
whose
faith
truth
and
honour
he
would
have
staked
his
very
existence
but
a
few
short
hours
before
with
such
a
bewildered
sensation
that
he
scarcely
knew
where
he
walked
or
whither
to
betake
himself
did
he
repair
to
his
own
chamber
and
there
he
strove
with
what
energy
he
was
able
to
bring
to
the
task
to
find
out
some
excuses
if
he
could
for
charles's
conduct
but
he
could
find
none
view
it
in
what
light
he
would
it
presented
but
a
picture
of
the
most
heartless
selfishness
it
had
ever
been
his
lot
to
encounter
the
tone
of
the
letters
too
which
charles
had
written
materially
aggravated
the
moral
delinquency
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
belief
far
better
had
he
not
attempted
an
excuse
at
all
than
have
attempted
such
excuses
as
were
there
put
down
in
those
epistles
a
more
cold
blooded
dishonourable
proceeding
could
not
possibly
be
conceived
it
would
appear
that
while
he
entertained
a
doubt
with
regard
to
the
reality
of
the
visitation
of
the
vampyre
to
flora
bannerworth
he
had
been
willing
to
take
to
himself
abundance
of
credit
for
the
most
honourable
feelings
and
to
induce
a
belief
in
the
minds
of
all
that
an
exalted
feeling
of
honour
as
well
as
a
true
affection
that
would
know
no
change
kept
him
at
the
feet
of
her
whom
he
loved
like
some
braggart
who
when
there
is
no
danger
is
a
very
hero
but
who
the
moment
he
feels
convinced
he
will
be
actually
and
truly
called
upon
for
an
exhibition
of
his
much-vaunted
prowess
had
charles
holland
deserted
the
beautiful
girl
who
if
anything
had
now
certainly
in
her
misfortunes
a
far
higher
claim
upon
his
kindly
feeling
than
before
henry
could
not
sleep
although
at
the
request
of
george
who
offered
to
keep
watch
for
him
the
remainder
of
the
night
he
attempted
to
do
so
he
in
vain
said
to
himself
i
will
banish
from
my
mind
this
most
unworthy
subject
i
have
told
admiral
bell
that
contempt
is
the
only
feeling
i
can
now
have
for
his
nephew
and
yet
i
now
find
myself
dwelling
upon
him
and
upon
his
conduct
with
a
perseverance
which
is
a
foe
to
my
repose
at
length
came
the
welcome
and
beautiful
light
of
day
and
henry
rose
fevered
and
unrefreshed
his
first
impulse
now
was
to
hold
a
consultation
with
his
brother
george
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
and
george
advised
that
mr
marchdale
who
as
yet
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
should
be
immediately
informed
of
it
and
consulted
as
being
probably
better
qualified
than
either
of
them
to
come
to
a
just
a
cool
and
a
reasonable
opinion
upon
the
painful
circumstance
which
it
could
not
be
expected
that
either
of
them
would
be
able
to
view
calmly
let
it
be
so
then
said
henry
mr
marchdale
shall
decide
for
us
they
at
once
sought
this
friend
of
the
family
who
was
in
his
own
bed-room
and
when
henry
knocked
at
the
door
marchdale
opened
it
hurriedly
eagerly
inquiring
what
was
the
matter
there
is
no
alarm
said
henry
we
have
only
come
to
tell
you
of
a
circumstance
which
has
occurred
during
the
night
and
which
will
somewhat
surprise
you
nothing
calamitous
i
hope
vexatious
and
yet
i
think
it
is
a
matter
upon
which
we
ought
almost
to
congratulate
ourselves
read
those
two
letters
and
give
us
your
candid
opinion
upon
them
henry
placed
in
mr
marchdale's
hands
the
letter
addressed
to
himself
as
well
as
that
to
the
admiral
marchdale
read
them
both
with
marked
attention
but
he
did
not
exhibit
in
his
countenance
so
much
surprise
as
regret
when
he
had
finished
henry
said
to
him--
well
marchdale
what
think
you
of
this
new
and
extraordinary
episode
in
our
affairs
my
dear
young
friends
said
marchdale
in
a
voice
of
great
emotion
i
know
not
what
to
say
to
you
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
you
are
both
of
you
much
astonished
at
the
receipt
of
these
letters
and
equally
so
at
the
sudden
absence
of
charles
holland
and
are
not
you
not
so
much
as
you
doubtless
are
the
fact
is
i
never
did
entertain
a
favourable
opinion
of
the
young
man
and
he
knew
it
i
have
been
accustomed
to
the
study
of
human
nature
under
a
variety
of
aspects
i
have
made
it
a
matter
of
deep
and
i
may
add
sorrowful
contemplation
to
study
and
remark
those
minor
shades
of
character
which
commonly
escape
observation
wholly
and
i
repeat
i
always
had
a
bad
opinion
of
charles
holland
which
he
guessed
and
hence
he
conceived
a
hatred
to
me
which
more
than
once
as
you
cannot
but
remember
showed
itself
in
little
acts
of
opposition
and
hostility
you
much
surprise
me
i
expected
to
do
so
but
you
cannot
help
remembering
that
at
one
time
i
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
here
solely
on
his
account
you
were
so
indeed
i
should
have
done
so
but
that
i
reasoned
with
myself
upon
the
subject
and
subdued
the
impulse
of
the
anger
which
some
years
ago
when
i
had
not
seen
so
much
of
the
world
would
have
guided
me
but
why
did
you
not
impart
to
us
your
suspicions
we
should
at
least
then
have
been
prepared
for
such
a
contingency
as
has
occurred
place
yourself
in
my
position
and
then
yourself
what
you
would
have
done
suspicion
is
one
of
those
hideous
things
which
all
men
should
be
most
specially
careful
not
only
how
they
entertain
at
all
but
how
they
give
expression
to
besides
whatever
may
be
the
amount
of
one's
own
internal
conviction
with
regard
to
the
character
of
any
one
there
is
just
a
possibility
that
one
may
be
wrong
true
true
that
possibility
ought
to
keep
any
one
silent
who
has
nothing
but
suspicion
to
go
upon
however
cautious
it
may
make
him
as
regards
his
dealings
with
the
individual
i
only
suspected
from
little
minute
shades
of
character
that
would
peep
out
in
spite
of
him
that
charles
holland
was
not
the
honourable
man
he
would
fain
have
had
everybody
believe
him
to
be
and
had
you
from
the
first
such
a
feeling
i
had
it
is
very
strange
yes
and
what
is
more
strange
still
is
that
he
from
the
first
seemed
to
know
it
and
despite
a
caution
which
i
could
see
he
always
kept
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
he
could
not
help
speaking
tartly
to
me
at
times
i
have
noticed
that
said
george
you
may
depend
it
is
a
fact
added
marchdale
that
nothing
so
much
excites
the
deadly
and
desperate
hatred
of
a
man
who
is
acting
a
hypocritical
part
as
the
suspicion
well
grounded
or
not
that
another
sees
and
understands
the
secret
impulses
of
his
dishonourable
heart
i
cannot
blame
you
or
any
one
else
mr
marchdale
said
henry
that
you
did
not
give
utterance
to
your
secret
thoughts
but
i
do
wish
that
you
had
done
so
nay
dear
henry
replied
mr
marchdale
believe
me
i
have
made
this
matter
a
subject
of
deep
thought
and
have
abundance
of
reasons
why
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
to
you
upon
the
subject
indeed
indeed
i
have
and
not
among
the
least
important
is
the
one
that
if
i
had
acquainted
you
with
my
suspicions
you
would
have
found
yourself
in
the
painful
position
of
acting
a
hypocritical
part
yourself
towards
this
charles
holland
for
you
must
either
have
kept
the
secret
that
he
was
suspected
or
you
must
have
shewn
it
to
him
by
your
behaviour
well
well
i
dare
say
marchdale
you
acted
for
the
best
what
shall
we
do
now
can
you
doubt
i
was
thinking
of
letting
flora
at
once
know
the
absolute
and
complete
worthlessness
of
her
lover
so
that
she
could
have
no
difficulty
in
at
once
tearing
herself
from
him
by
the
assistance
of
the
natural
pride
which
would
surely
come
to
her
aid
upon
finding
herself
so
much
deceived
the
test
may
be
possible
you
think
so
i
do
indeed
here
is
a
letter
which
of
course
remains
unopened
addressed
to
flora
by
charles
holland
the
admiral
rather
thought
it
would
hurt
her
feelings
to
deliver
her
such
an
epistle
but
i
must
confess
i
am
of
a
contrary
opinion
upon
that
point
and
think
now
the
more
evidence
she
has
of
the
utter
worthlessness
of
him
who
professed
to
love
her
with
so
much
disinterested
affection
the
better
it
will
be
for
her
you
could
not
possibly
henry
have
taken
a
more
sensible
view
of
the
subject
i
am
glad
you
agree
with
me
no
reasonable
man
could
do
otherwise
and
from
what
i
have
seen
of
admiral
bell
i
am
sure
upon
reflection
he
will
be
of
the
same
opinion
then
it
shall
be
so
the
first
shock
to
poor
flora
may
be
severe
but
we
shall
then
have
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
it
is
the
only
one
and
that
in
knowing
the
very
worst
she
has
no
more
on
that
score
to
apprehend
alas
alas
the
hand
of
misfortune
now
appears
to
have
pressed
heavily
upon
us
indeed
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
unlucky
and
disastrous
will
happen
next
i
wonder
what
can
happen
said
marchdale
i
think
you
have
now
got
rid
of
the
greatest
evil
of
all--a
false
friend
we
have
indeed
go
then
to
flora
assure
her
that
in
the
affection
of
others
who
know
no
falsehood
she
will
find
a
solace
from
every
ill
assure
her
that
there
are
hearts
that
will
place
themselves
between
her
and
every
misfortune
mr
marchdale
was
much
affected
as
he
spoke
probably
he
felt
deeper
than
he
chose
to
express
the
misfortunes
of
that
family
for
whom
he
entertained
so
much
friendship
he
turned
aside
his
head
to
hide
the
traces
of
emotion
which
despite
even
his
great
powers
of
self-command
would
shew
themselves
upon
his
handsome
and
intelligent
countenance
then
it
appeared
as
if
his
noble
indignation
had
got
for
a
few
brief
moments
the
better
of
all
prudence
and
he
exclaimed--
the
villain
the
worse
than
villain
who
would
with
a
thousand
artifices
make
himself
beloved
by
a
young
unsuspecting
and
beautiful
girl
but
then
to
leave
her
to
the
bitterness
of
regret
that
she
had
ever
given
such
a
man
a
place
in
her
esteem
the
heartless
ruffian
be
calm
mr
marchdale
i
pray
you
be
calm
said
george
i
never
saw
you
so
much
moved
excuse
me
he
said
excuse
me
i
am
much
moved
and
i
am
human
i
cannot
always
let
me
strive
my
utmost
place
a
curb
upon
my
feelings
they
are
feelings
which
do
you
honour
nay
nay
i
am
foolish
to
have
suffered
myself
to
be
led
away
into
such
a
hasty
expression
of
them
i
am
accustomed
to
feel
acutely
and
to
feel
deeply
but
it
is
seldom
i
am
so
much
overcome
as
this
will
you
accompany
us
to
the
breakfast
room
at
once
mr
marchdale
where
we
will
make
this
communication
to
flora
you
will
then
be
able
to
judge
by
her
manner
of
receiving
it
what
it
will
be
best
to
say
to
her
come
then
and
pray
be
calm
the
least
that
is
said
upon
this
painful
and
harassing
subject
after
this
morning
will
be
the
best
you
are
right--you
are
right
mr
marchdale
hastily
put
on
his
coat
he
was
dressed
with
the
exception
of
that
one
article
of
apparel
when
the
brothers
came
to
his
chamber
and
then
he
came
to
the
breakfast-parlour
where
the
painful
communication
was
to
be
made
to
flora
of
her
lover's
faithlessness
flora
was
already
seated
in
that
apartment
indeed
she
had
been
accustomed
to
meet
charles
holland
there
before
others
of
the
family
made
their
appearance
but
alas
this
morning
the
kind
and
tender
lover
was
not
there
the
expression
that
sat
upon
the
countenances
of
her
brothers
and
of
mr
marchdale
was
quite
sufficient
to
convince
her
that
something
more
serious
than
usual
had
occurred
and
she
at
the
moment
turned
very
pale
marchdale
observed
this
change
of
change
of
countenance
in
her
and
he
advanced
towards
her
saying--
calm
yourself
flora
we
have
something
to
communicate
to
you
but
it
is
a
something
which
should
excite
indignation
and
no
other
feeling
in
your
breast
brother
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
said
flora
turning
aside
from
marchdale
and
withdrawing
the
hand
which
he
would
have
taken
i
would
rather
have
admiral
bell
here
before
i
say
anything
said
henry
regarding
a
matter
in
which
he
cannot
but
feel
much
interested
personally
here
he
is
said
the
admiral
who
at
that
moment
had
opened
the
door
of
the
breakfast
room
here
he
is
so
now
fire
away
and
don't
spare
the
enemy
and
charles
said
flora
where
is
charles
d--n
charles
cried
the
admiral
who
had
not
been
much
accustomed
to
control
his
feelings
hush
hush
said
henry
my
dear
sir
hush
do
not
indulge
now
in
any
invectives
flora
here
are
three
letters
you
will
see
that
the
one
which
is
unopened
is
addressed
to
yourself
however
we
wish
you
to
read
the
whole
three
of
them
and
then
to
form
your
own
free
and
unbiased
opinion
flora
looked
as
pale
as
a
marble
statue
when
she
took
the
letters
into
her
hands
she
let
the
two
that
were
open
fall
on
the
table
before
her
while
she
eagerly
broke
the
seal
of
that
which
was
addressed
to
herself
illustration
henry
with
an
instinctive
delicacy
beckoned
every
one
present
to
the
window
so
that
flora
had
not
the
pain
of
feeling
that
any
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
but
those
of
her
mother
who
had
just
come
into
the
room
while
she
was
perusing
those
documents
which
told
such
a
tale
of
heartless
dissimulation
my
dear
child
said
mrs
bannerworth
you
are
ill
hush
mother--hush
said
flora
let
me
know
all
she
read
the
whole
of
the
letters
through
and
then
as
the
last
one
dropped
from
her
grasp
she
exclaimed--
oh
god
oh
god
what
is
all
that
has
occurred
compared
to
this
charles--charles--charles
flora
exclaimed
henry
suddenly
turning
from
the
window
flora
is
this
worthy
of
you
heaven
now
support
me
is
this
worthy
of
the
name
you
bear
flora
i
should
have
thought
and
i
did
hope
that
woman's
pride
would
have
supported
you
let
me
implore
you
added
marchdale
to
summon
indignation
to
your
aid
miss
bannerworth
charles--charles--charles
she
again
exclaimed
as
she
wrung
her
hands
despairingly
flora
if
anything
could
add
a
sting
to
my
already
irritated
feelings
said
henry
this
conduct
of
yours
would
henry--brother
what
mean
you
are
you
mad
are
you
flora
god
i
wish
now
that
i
was
you
have
read
those
letters
and
yet
you
call
upon
the
name
of
him
who
wrote
them
with
frantic
tenderness
yes
yes
she
cried
frantic
tenderness
is
the
word
it
is
with
frantic
tenderness
i
call
upon
his
name
and
ever
will--charles
charles--dear
charles
this
surpasses
all
belief
said
marchdale
it
is
the
frenzy
of
grief
added
george
but
i
did
not
expect
it
of
her
flora--flora
think
again
think--think--the
rush
of
thought
distracts
whence
came
these
letters--where
did
you
find
these
most
disgraceful
forgeries
forgeries
exclaimed
henry
and
he
staggered
back
as
if
someone
had
struck
him
a
blow
yes
forgeries
screamed
flora
what
has
become
of
charles
holland
has
he
been
murdered
by
some
secret
enemy
and
then
these
most
vile
fabrications
made
up
in
his
name
oh
charles
charles
are
you
lost
to
me
for
ever
good
god
said
henry
i
did
not
think
of
that
madness--madness
cried
marchdale
hold
shouted
the
admiral
let
me
speak
to
her
he
pushed
every
one
aside
and
advanced
to
flora
he
seized
both
her
hands
in
his
own
and
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
was
struggling
with
feeling
he
cried--
look
at
me
my
dear
i'm
an
old
man
old
enough
to
be
your
grandfather
so
you
needn't
mind
looking
me
steadily
in
the
face
look
at
me
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
flora
raised
her
beautiful
eyes
and
looked
the
old
weather-beaten
admiral
full
in
the
face
oh
what
a
striking
contrast
did
those
two
persons
present
to
each
other
that
young
and
beautiful
girl
with
her
small
delicate
childlike
hands
clasped
and
completely
hidden
in
the
huge
ones
of
the
old
sailor
the
white
smooth
skin
contrasting
wonderfully
with
his
wrinkled
hardened
features
my
dear
he
cried
you
have
read
those--those
d----d
letters
my
dear
i
have
sir
and
what
do
you
think
of
them
they
were
not
written
by
charles
holland
your
nephew
a
choking
sensation
seemed
to
come
over
the
old
man
and
he
tried
to
speak
but
in
vain
he
shook
the
hands
of
the
young
girl
violently
until
he
saw
that
he
was
hurting
her
and
then
before
she
could
be
aware
of
what
he
was
about
he
gave
her
a
kiss
on
the
cheek
as
he
cried--
god
bless
you--god
bless
you
you
are
the
sweetest
dearest
little
creature
that
ever
was
or
that
ever
will
be
and
i'm
a
d----d
old
fool
that's
what
i
am
these
letters
were
not
written
by
my
nephew
charles
he
is
incapable
of
writing
them
and
d--n
me
i
shall
take
shame
to
myself
as
long
as
i
live
for
ever
thinking
so
dear
sir
said
flora
who
somehow
or
another
did
not
seem
at
all
offended
at
the
kiss
which
the
old
man
had
given
her
dear
sir
how
could
you
believe
for
one
moment
that
they
came
from
him
there
has
been
some
desperate
villany
on
foot
where
is
he--oh
find
him
if
he
be
yet
alive
if
they
who
have
thus
striven
to
steal
from
him
that
honour
which
is
the
jewel
of
his
heart
have
murdered
him
seek
them
out
sir
in
the
sacred
name
of
justice
i
implore
you
i
will--i
will
i
don't
renounce
him
he
is
my
nephew
still--charles
holland--my
own
dear
sister's
son
and
you
are
the
best
girl
god
bless
you
that
ever
breathed
he
loved
you--he
loves
you
still
and
if
he's
above
ground
poor
fellow
he
shall
yet
tell
you
himself
he
never
saw
those
infamous
letters
you--you
will
seek
for
him
sobbed
flora
and
the
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
upon
you
sir
who
as
i
do
feel
assured
of
his
innocence
i
alone
rely
if
all
the
world
say
he
is
guilty
we
will
not
think
so
i'm
d----d
if
we
do
henry
had
sat
down
by
the
table
and
with
his
hands
clasped
together
seemed
in
an
agony
of
thought
he
was
now
roused
by
a
thump
on
the
back
by
the
admiral
who
cried--
what
do
you
think
now
old
fellow
d--n
it
things
look
a
little
different
now
as
god
is
my
judge
said
henry
holding
up
his
hands
i
know
not
what
to
think
but
my
heart
and
feelings
all
go
with
you
and
with
flora
in
your
opinion
of
the
innocence
of
charles
holland
i
knew
you
would
say
that
because
you
could
not
possibly
help
it
my
dear
boy
now
we
are
all
right
again
and
all
we
have
got
to
do
is
to
find
out
which
way
the
enemy
has
gone
and
then
give
chase
to
him
mr
marchdale
what
do
you
think
of
this
new
suggestion
said
george
to
that
gentleman
pray
excuse
me
was
his
reply
i
would
much
rather
not
be
called
upon
to
give
an
opinion
why
what
do
you
mean
by
that
said
the
admiral
precisely
what
i
say
sir
d--n
me
we
had
a
fellow
once
in
the
combined
fleets
who
never
had
an
opinion
till
after
something
had
happened
and
then
he
always
said
that
was
just
what
he
thought
i
was
never
in
the
combined
or
any
other
fleet
sir
said
marchdale
coldly
who
the
devil
said
you
were
roared
the
admiral
marchdale
merely
hawed
however
added
the
admiral
i
don't
care
and
never
did
for
anybody's
opinion
when
i
know
i
am
right
i'd
back
this
dear
girl
here
for
opinions
and
good
feelings
and
courage
to
express
them
against
all
the
world
i
would
any
day
if
i
was
not
the
old
hulk
i
am
i
would
take
a
cruise
in
any
latitude
under
the
sun
if
it
was
only
for
the
chance
of
meeting
with
just
such
another
oh
lose
no
time
said
flora
if
charles
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
house
lose
no
time
in
searching
for
him
i
pray
you
seek
him
wherever
there
is
the
remotest
probability
he
may
chance
to
be
do
not
let
him
think
he
is
deserted
not
a
bit
of
it
cried
the
admiral
you
make
your
mind
easy
my
dear
if
he's
above
ground
we
shall
find
him
out
you
may
depend
upon
it
come
along
master
henry
you
and
i
will
consider
what
had
best
be
done
in
this
uncommonly
ugly
matter
henry
and
george
followed
the
admiral
from
the
breakfast-room
leaving
marchdale
there
who
looked
serious
and
full
of
melancholy
thought
it
was
quite
clear
that
he
considered
flora
had
spoken
from
the
generous
warmth
of
her
affection
as
regarded
charles
holland
and
not
from
the
convictions
which
reason
would
have
enforced
her
to
feel
when
he
was
now
alone
with
her
and
mrs
bannerworth
he
spoke
in
a
feeling
and
affectionate
tone
regarding
the
painful
and
inexplicable
events
which
had
transpired
mr
marchdale's
exculpation
of
himself--the
search
through
the
gardens--the
spot
of
the
deadly
struggle--the
mysterious
paper
illustration
it
was
perhaps
very
natural
that
with
her
feelings
towards
charles
holland
flora
should
shrink
from
every
one
who
seemed
to
be
of
a
directly
contrary
impression
and
when
mr
marchdale
now
spoke
she
showed
but
little
inclination
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
in
explanation
the
genuine
and
unaffected
manner
however
in
which
he
spoke
could
not
but
have
its
effect
upon
her
and
she
found
herself
compelled
to
listen
as
well
as
to
a
great
extent
approve
of
the
sentiments
that
fell
from
his
lips
flora
he
said
i
beg
that
you
will
here
in
the
presence
of
your
mother
give
me
a
patient
hearing
you
fancy
that
because
i
cannot
join
so
glibly
as
the
admiral
in
believing
that
these
letters
are
forgeries
i
must
be
your
enemy
those
letters
said
flora
were
not
written
by
charles
holland
that
is
your
opinion
it
is
more
than
an
opinion
he
could
not
write
them
well
then
of
course
if
i
felt
inclined
which
heaven
alone
knows
i
do
not
i
could
not
hope
successfully
to
argue
against
such
a
conviction
but
i
do
not
wish
to
do
so
all
i
want
to
impress
upon
you
is
that
i
am
not
to
be
blamed
for
doubting
his
innocence
and
at
the
same
time
i
wish
to
assure
you
that
no
one
in
this
house
would
feel
more
exquisite
satisfaction
than
i
in
seeing
it
established
i
thank
you
for
so
much
said
flora
but
as
to
my
mind
his
innocence
has
never
been
doubted
it
needs
to
me
no
establishing
very
good
you
believe
these
letters
forgeries
i
do
and
that
the
disappearance
of
charles
holland
is
enforced
and
not
of
his
own
free
will
i
do
then
you
may
rely
upon
my
unremitting
exertions
night
and
day
to
find
him
and
any
suggestion
you
can
make
which
is
likely
to
aid
in
the
search
shall
i
pledge
myself
be
fully
carried
out
i
thank
you
mr
marchdale
my
dear
said
the
mother
rely
on
mr
marchdale
i
will
rely
on
any
one
who
believe
charles
holland
innocent
of
writing
those
odious
letters
mother--i
rely
upon
the
admiral
he
will
aid
me
heart
and
hand
and
so
will
mr
marchdale
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
and
yet
doubt
it
flora
said
marchdale
dejectedly
i
am
very
sorry
that
such
should
be
the
case
i
will
not
however
trouble
you
any
further
nor
give
me
leave
to
assure
you
will
i
relax
in
my
honest
endeavours
to
clear
up
this
mystery
so
saying
mr
marchdale
bowed
and
left
the
room
apparently
more
vexed
than
he
cared
to
express
at
the
misconstruction
which
had
been
put
upon
his
conduct
and
motives
he
at
once
sought
henry
and
the
admiral
to
whom
he
expressed
his
most
earnest
desire
to
aid
in
attempting
to
unravel
the
mysterious
circumstances
which
had
occurred
this
strongly-expressed
opinion
of
flora
he
remarked
is
of
course
amply
sufficient
to
induce
us
to
pause
before
we
say
one
word
more
that
shall
in
any
way
sound
like
a
condemnation
of
mr
holland
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
no
said
the
admiral
don't
i
do
not
intend
i
would
not
advise
anybody
sir
if
you
use
that
as
a
threat--
a
threat
yes
i
must
say
it
sounded
marvellously
like
one
oh
dear
no--quite
a
mistake
i
consider
that
every
man
has
a
fair
right
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
opinion
all
i
have
to
remark
is
that
i
shall
after
what
has
occurred
feel
myself
called
upon
to
fight
anybody
who
says
those
letters
were
written
by
my
nephew
indeed
sir
ah
indeed
you
will
permit
me
to
say
such
is
a
strange
mode
of
allowing
every
one
the
free
enjoyment
of
his
opinion
not
at
all
whatever
pains
and
penalties
may
be
the
result
admiral
bell
of
differing
with
so
infallible
authority
as
yourself
i
shall
do
so
whenever
my
judgment
induces
me
you
will
indeed
i
will
very
good
you
know
the
consequences
as
to
fighting
you
i
should
refuse
to
do
so
refuse
yes
most
certainly
upon
what
ground
upon
the
ground
that
you
were
a
madman
come
now
interposed
henry
let
me
hope
that
for
my
sake
as
well
as
for
flora's
this
dispute
will
proceed
no
further
i
have
not
courted
it
said
marchdale
i
have
much
temper
but
i
am
not
a
stick
or
a
stone
d----e
if
i
don't
think
said
the
admiral
you
are
a
bit
of
both
mr
henry
bannerworth
said
marchdale
i
am
your
guest
and
but
for
the
duty
i
feel
in
assisting
in
the
search
for
mr
charles
holland
i
should
at
once
leave
your
house
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
on
my
account
said
the
admiral
if
i
find
no
clue
to
him
in
the
neighbourhood
for
two
or
three
days
i
shall
be
off
myself
i
am
going
said
henry
rising
to
search
the
garden
and
adjoining
meadows
if
you
two
gentlemen
choose
to
come
with
me
i
shall
of
course
be
happy
of
your
company
if
however
you
prefer
remaining
here
to
wrangle
you
can
do
so
this
had
the
effect
at
all
events
of
putting
a
stop
to
the
dispute
for
the
present
and
both
the
admiral
and
mr
marchdale
accompanied
henry
on
his
search
that
search
was
commenced
immediately
under
the
balcony
of
charles
holland's
window
from
which
the
admiral
had
seen
him
emerge
there
was
nothing
particular
found
there
or
in
the
garden
admiral
bell
pointed
out
accurately
the
route
he
had
seen
charles
take
across
the
grass
plot
just
before
he
himself
left
his
chamber
to
seek
henry
accordingly
this
route
was
now
taken
and
it
led
to
a
low
part
of
the
garden
wall
which
any
one
of
ordinary
vigour
could
easily
have
surmounted
my
impression
is
said
the
admiral
that
he
got
over
here
the
ivy
appears
to
be
disturbed
remarked
henry
suppose
we
mark
the
spot
and
then
go
round
to
it
on
the
outer
side
suggested
george
this
was
agreed
to
for
although
the
young
man
might
have
chosen
rather
to
clamber
over
the
wall
than
go
round
it
was
doubtful
if
the
old
admiral
could
accomplish
such
a
feat
the
distance
round
however
was
not
great
and
as
they
had
cast
over
the
wall
a
handful
of
flowers
from
the
garden
to
mark
the
precise
spot
it
was
easily
discoverable
the
moment
they
reached
it
they
were
panic-stricken
by
the
appearances
which
it
presented
the
grass
was
for
some
yards
round
about
completely
trodden
up
and
converted
into
mud
there
were
deep
indentations
of
feet-marks
in
all
directions
and
such
abundance
of
evidence
that
some
most
desperate
struggle
had
recently
taken
place
there
that
the
most
sceptical
person
in
the
world
could
not
have
entertained
any
doubt
upon
the
subject
henry
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
with
which
they
each
regarded
the
broken
ground
this
is
conclusive
to
my
mind
he
said
with
a
deep
sigh
here
has
poor
charles
been
attacked
god
keep
him
exclaimed
marchdale
and
pardon
me
my
doubts--i
am
now
convinced
the
old
admiral
gazed
about
him
like
one
distracted
suddenly
he
cried--
they
have
murdered
him
some
fiends
in
the
shape
of
men
have
murdered
him
and
heaven
only
knows
for
what
it
seems
but
too
probable
said
henry
let
us
endeavour
to
trace
the
footsteps
oh
flora
flora
what
terrible
news
this
will
be
to
you
a
horrible
supposition
comes
across
my
mind
said
george
what
if
he
met
the
vampyre
it
may
have
been
so
said
marchdale
with
a
shudder
it
is
a
point
which
we
should
endeavour
to
ascertain
and
i
think
we
may
do
so
how
by
some
inquiry
as
to
whether
sir
francis
varney
was
from
home
at
midnight
last
night
true
that
might
be
done
the
question
suddenly
put
to
one
of
his
servants
would
most
probably
be
answered
as
a
thing
of
course
it
would
then
that
shall
be
decided
upon
and
now
my
friends
since
you
have
some
of
you
thought
me
luke-warm
in
this
business
i
pledge
myself
that
should
it
be
ascertained
that
varney
was
from
home
at
midnight
last
evening
i
will
defy
him
personally
and
meet
him
hand
to
hand
nay
nay
said
henry
leave
that
course
to
younger
hands
why
so
it
more
befits
me
to
be
his
challenger
no
henry
you
are
differently
situated
to
what
i
am
how
so
remember
that
i
am
in
the
world
a
lone
man
without
ties
or
connexions
if
i
lose
my
life
i
compromise
no
one
by
my
death
but
you
have
a
mother
and
a
bereaved
sister
to
look
to
who
will
deserve
your
care
hilloa
cried
the
admiral
what's
this
what
cried
each
eagerly
and
they
pressed
forward
to
where
the
admiral
was
stooping
to
the
ground
to
pick
up
something
which
was
nearly
completely
trodden
into
the
grass
he
with
some
difficulty
raised
it
it
was
a
small
slip
of
paper
on
which
was
some
writing
but
it
was
so
much
covered
with
mud
as
not
to
be
legible
if
this
be
washed
said
henry
i
think
we
shall
be
able
to
read
it
clearly
we
can
soon
try
that
experiment
said
george
and
as
the
footsteps
by
some
mysterious
means
show
themselves
nowhere
else
but
in
this
one
particular
spot
any
further
pursuit
of
inquiry
about
here
appears
useless
then
we
will
return
to
the
house
said
henry
and
wash
the
mud
from
this
paper
there
is
one
important
point
remarked
marchdale
which
it
appears
to
me
we
have
all
overlooked
indeed
yes
what
may
that
be
it
is
this
is
any
one
here
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
handwriting
of
mr
charles
holland
to
come
to
an
opinion
upon
the
letters
i
have
some
letters
from
him
said
henry
which
we
received
while
on
the
continent
and
i
dare
say
flora
has
likewise
then
they
should
be
compared
with
the
alleged
forgeries
i
know
his
handwriting
well
said
the
admiral
the
letters
bear
so
strong
a
resemblance
to
it
that
they
would
deceive
anybody
then
you
may
depend
remarked
henry
some
most
deep-laid
and
desperate
plot
is
going
on
i
begin
added
marchdale
to
dread
that
such
must
be
the
case
what
say
you
to
claiming
the
assistance
of
the
authorities
as
well
as
offering
a
large
reward
for
any
information
regarding
mr
charles
holland
no
plan
shall
be
left
untried
you
may
depend
they
had
now
reached
the
house
and
henry
having
procured
some
clean
water
carefully
washed
the
paper
which
had
been
found
among
the
trodden
grass
when
freed
from
the
mixture
of
clay
and
mud
which
had
obscured
it
they
made
out
the
following
words--
--it
be
so
well
at
the
next
full
moon
seek
a
convenient
spot
and
it
can
be
done
the
signature
is
to
my
apprehension
perfect
the
money
which
i
hold
in
my
opinion
is
much
more
in
amount
than
you
imagine
must
be
ours
and
as
for--
here
the
paper
was
torn
across
and
no
further
words
were
visible
upon
it
mystery
seemed
now
to
be
accumulating
upon
mystery
each
one
as
it
showed
itself
darkly
seeming
to
bear
some
remote
relation
to
what
preceded
it
and
yet
only
confusing
it
the
more
that
this
apparent
scrap
of
a
letter
had
dropped
from
some
one's
pocket
during
the
fearful
struggle
of
which
there
were
such
ample
evidences
was
extremely
probable
but
what
it
related
to
by
whom
it
was
written
or
by
whom
dropped
were
unfathomable
mysteries
in
fact
no
one
could
give
an
opinion
upon
these
matters
at
all
and
after
a
further
series
of
conjectures
it
could
only
be
decided
that
unimportant
as
the
scrap
of
paper
appeared
now
to
be
it
should
be
preserved
in
case
it
should
as
there
was
a
dim
possibility
that
it
might
become
a
connecting
link
in
some
chain
of
evidence
at
another
time
and
here
we
are
said
henry
completely
at
fault
and
knowing
not
what
to
do
well
it
is
a
hard
case
said
the
admiral
that
with
all
the
will
in
the
world
to
be
up
and
doing
something
we
are
lying
here
like
a
fleet
of
ships
in
a
calm
as
idle
as
possible
you
perceive
we
have
no
evidence
to
connect
sir
francis
varney
with
this
affair
either
nearly
or
remotely
said
marchdale
certainly
not
replied
henry
but
yet
i
hope
you
will
not
lose
sight
of
the
suggestion
i
proposed
to
the
effect
of
ascertaining
if
he
were
from
home
last
night
but
how
is
that
to
be
carried
out
boldly
how
boldly
by
going
at
once
i
should
advise
to
his
house
and
asking
the
first
one
of
his
domestics
you
may
happen
to
see
i
will
go
over
cried
george
on
such
occasions
as
these
one
cannot
act
upon
ceremony
he
seized
his
hat
and
without
waiting
for
a
word
from
any
one
approving
or
condemning
his
going
off
he
went
if
said
henry
we
find
that
varney
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
we
are
completely
at
fault
completely
echoed
marchdale
in
that
case
admiral
i
think
we
ought
to
defer
to
your
feelings
upon
the
subject
and
do
whatever
you
suggest
should
be
done
i
shall
offer
a
hundred
pounds
reward
to
any
one
who
can
and
will
bring
any
news
of
charles
a
hundred
pounds
is
too
much
said
marchdale
not
at
all
and
while
i
am
about
it
since
the
amount
is
made
a
subject
of
discussion
i
shall
make
it
two
hundred
and
that
may
benefit
some
rascal
who
is
not
so
well
paid
for
keeping
the
secret
as
i
will
pay
him
for
disclosing
it
perhaps
you
are
right
said
marchdale
i
know
i
am
as
i
always
am
marchdale
could
not
forbear
a
smile
at
the
opinionated
old
man
who
thought
no
one's
opinion
upon
any
subject
at
all
equal
to
his
own
but
he
made
no
remark
and
only
waited
as
did
henry
with
evident
anxiety
for
the
return
of
george
the
distance
was
not
great
and
george
certainly
performed
his
errand
quickly
for
he
was
back
in
less
time
than
they
had
thought
he
could
return
in
the
moment
he
came
into
the
room
he
said
without
waiting
for
any
inquiry
to
be
made
of
him--
we
are
at
fault
again
i
am
assured
that
sir
francis
varney
never
stirred
from
home
after
eight
o'clock
last
evening
d--n
it
then
said
the
admiral
let
us
give
the
devil
his
due
he
could
not
have
had
any
hand
in
this
business
certainly
not
from
whom
george
did
you
get
your
information
asked
henry
in
a
desponding
tone
from
first
of
all
one
of
his
servants
whom
i
met
away
from
the
house
and
then
from
one
whom
i
saw
at
the
house
there
can
be
no
mistake
then
certainly
none
the
servants
answered
me
at
once
and
so
frankly
that
i
cannot
doubt
it
the
door
of
the
room
was
slowly
opened
and
flora
came
in
she
looked
almost
the
shadow
of
what
she
had
been
but
a
few
weeks
before
she
was
beautiful
but
she
almost
realised
the
poet's
description
of
one
who
had
suffered
much
and
was
sinking
into
an
early
grave
the
victim
of
a
broken
heart--
she
was
more
beautiful
than
death
and
yet
as
sad
to
look
upon
her
face
was
of
a
marble
paleness
and
as
she
clasped
her
hands
and
glanced
from
face
to
face
to
see
if
she
could
gather
hope
and
consolation
from
the
expression
of
any
one
she
might
have
been
taken
for
some
exquisite
statue
of
despair
have
you
found
him
she
said
have
you
found
charles
flora
flora
said
henry
as
he
approached
her
nay
answer
me
have
you
found
him
you
went
to
seek
him
dead
or
alive
have
you
found
him
we
have
not
flora
then
i
must
seek
him
myself
none
will
search
for
him
as
i
will
search
i
must
myself
seek
him
'tis
true
affection
that
can
alone
be
successful
in
such
a
search
believe
me
dear
flora
that
all
has
been
done
which
the
shortness
of
the
time
that
has
elapsed
would
permit
further
measures
will
now
immediately
be
taken
rest
assured
dear
sister
that
all
will
be
done
that
the
utmost
zeal
can
suggest
they
have
killed
him
they
have
killed
him
she
said
mournfully
oh
god
they
have
killed
him
i
am
not
now
mad
but
the
time
will
come
when
i
must
surely
be
maddened
the
vampyre
has
killed
charles
holland--the
dreadful
vampyre
nay
now
flora
this
is
frenzy
because
he
loved
me
has
he
been
destroyed
i
know
it
i
know
it
the
vampyre
has
doomed
me
to
destruction
i
am
lost
and
all
who
loved
me
will
be
involved
in
one
common
ruin
on
my
account
leave
me
all
of
you
to
perish
if
for
iniquities
done
in
our
family
some
one
must
suffer
to
appease
the
divine
vengeance
let
that
one
be
me
and
only
me
hush
sister
hush
cried
henry
i
expected
not
this
from
you
the
expressions
you
use
are
not
your
expressions
i
know
you
better
there
is
abundance
of
divine
mercy
but
no
divine
vengeance
be
calm
i
pray
you
calm
calm
yes
make
an
exertion
of
that
intellect
we
all
know
you
to
possess
it
is
too
common
a
thing
with
human
nature
when
misfortune
overtakes
it
to
imagine
that
such
a
state
of
things
is
specially
arranged
we
quarrel
with
providence
because
it
does
not
interfere
with
some
special
miracle
in
our
favour
forgetting
that
being
denizens
of
this
earth
and
members
of
a
great
social
system
we
must
be
subject
occasionally
to
the
accidents
which
will
disturb
its
efficient
working
oh
brother
brother
she
exclaimed
as
she
dropped
into
a
seat
you
have
never
loved
indeed
no
you
have
never
felt
what
it
was
to
hold
your
being
upon
the
breath
of
another
you
can
reason
calmly
because
you
cannot
know
the
extent
of
feeling
you
are
vainly
endeavouring
to
combat
flora
you
do
me
less
than
justice
all
i
wish
to
impress
upon
your
mind
is
that
you
are
not
in
any
way
picked
out
by
providence
to
be
specially
unhappy--that
there
is
no
perversion
of
nature
on
your
account
call
you
that
hideous
vampyre
form
that
haunts
me
no
perversion
of
ordinary
nature
what
is
is
natural
said
marchdale
cold
reasoning
to
one
who
suffers
as
i
suffer
i
cannot
argue
with
you
i
can
only
know
that
i
am
most
unhappy--most
miserable
but
that
will
pass
away
sister
and
the
sun
of
your
happiness
may
smile
again
oh
if
i
could
but
hope
and
wherefore
should
you
deprive
yourself
of
that
poorest
privilege
of
the
most
unhappy
because
my
heart
tells
me
to
despair
tell
it
you
won't
then
cried
admiral
bell
if
you
had
been
at
sea
as
long
as
i
have
miss
bannerworth
you
would
never
despair
of
anything
at
all
providence
guarded
you
said
marchdale
yes
that's
true
enough
i
dare
say
i
was
in
a
storm
once
off
cape
ushant
and
it
was
only
through
providence
and
cutting
away
the
mainmast
myself
that
we
succeeded
in
getting
into
port
you
have
one
hope
said
marchdale
to
flora
as
he
looked
in
her
wan
face
one
hope
yes
recollect
you
have
one
hope
what
is
that
you
think
that
by
removing
from
this
place
you
may
find
that
peace
which
is
here
denied
you
no
no
no
indeed
i
thought
that
such
was
your
firm
conviction
it
was
but
circumstances
have
altered
how
charles
holland
has
disappeared
here
and
here
must
i
remain
to
seek
for
him
true
he
may
have
disappeared
here
remarked
marchdale
and
yet
that
may
be
no
argument
for
supposing
him
still
here
where
then
is
he
god
knows
how
rejoiced
i
should
be
if
i
were
able
to
answer
your
question
i
must
seek
him
dead
or
alive
i
must
see
him
yet
before
i
bid
adieu
to
this
world
which
has
now
lost
all
its
charms
for
me
do
not
despair
said
henry
i
will
go
to
the
town
now
at
once
to
make
known
our
suspicions
that
he
has
met
with
some
foul
play
i
will
set
every
means
in
operation
that
i
possibly
can
to
discover
him
mr
chillingworth
will
aid
me
too
and
i
hope
that
not
many
days
will
elapse
flora
before
some
intelligence
of
a
most
satisfactory
nature
shall
be
brought
to
you
on
charles
holland's
account
go
go
brother
go
at
once
i
go
now
at
once
shall
i
accompany
you
said
marchdale
no
remain
here
to
keep
watch
over
flora's
safety
while
i
am
gone
i
can
alone
do
all
that
can
be
done
and
don't
forget
to
offer
the
two
hundred
pounds
reward
said
the
admiral
to
any
one
who
can
bring
us
news
of
charles
on
which
we
can
rely
i
will
not
surely--surely
something
must
result
from
that
said
flora
as
she
looked
in
the
admiral's
face
as
if
to
gather
encouragement
in
her
dawning
hopes
from
its
expression
of
course
it
will
my
dear
he
said
don't
you
be
downhearted
you
and
i
are
of
one
mind
in
this
affair
and
of
one
mind
we
will
keep
we
won't
give
up
our
opinions
for
anybody
our
opinions
she
said
of
the
honour
and
honesty
of
charles
holland
that
is
what
we
will
adhere
to
of
course
we
will
ah
sir
it
joys
me
even
in
the
midst
of
this
my
affliction
to
find
one
at
least
who
is
determined
to
do
him
full
justice
we
cannot
find
such
contradictions
in
nature
as
that
a
mind
full
of
noble
impulses
should
stoop
to
such
a
sudden
act
of
selfishness
as
those
letters
would
attribute
to
charles
holland
it
cannot--cannot
be
you
are
right
my
dear
and
now
master
henry
you
be
off
will
you
if
you
please
i
am
off
now
farewell
flora
for
a
brief
space
farewell
brother
and
heaven
speed
you
on
your
errand
amen
to
that
cried
the
admiral
and
now
my
dear
if
you
have
got
half
an
hour
to
spare
just
tuck
your
arm
under
mine
and
take
a
walk
with
me
in
the
garden
for
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
most
willingly
said
flora
i
would
not
advise
you
to
stray
far
from
the
house
miss
bannerworth
said
marchdale
nobody
asked
you
for
advice
said
the
admiral
d----e
do
you
want
to
make
out
that
i
ain't
capable
of
taking
care
of
her
no
no
but--
oh
nonsense
come
along
my
dear
and
if
all
the
vampyres
and
odd
fish
that
were
ever
created
were
to
come
across
our
path
we
would
settle
them
somehow
or
another
come
along
and
don't
listen
to
anybody's
croaking
a
peep
through
an
iron
grating--the
lonely
prisoner
in
his
dungeon--the
mystery
illustration
without
forestalling
the
interest
of
our
story
or
recording
a
fact
in
its
wrong
place
we
now
call
our
readers'
attention
to
a
circumstance
which
may
at
all
events
afford
some
food
for
conjecture
some
distance
from
the
hall
which
from
time
immemorial
had
been
the
home
and
the
property
of
the
bannerworth
family
was
an
ancient
ruin
known
by
the
name
of
the
monks'
hall
it
was
conjectured
that
this
ruin
was
the
remains
of
some
one
of
those
half
monastic
half
military
buildings
which
during
the
middle
ages
were
so
common
in
almost
every
commanding
situation
in
every
county
of
england
at
a
period
of
history
when
the
church
arrogated
to
itself
an
amount
of
political
power
which
the
intelligence
of
the
spirit
of
the
age
now
denies
to
it
and
when
its
members
were
quite
ready
to
assert
at
any
time
the
truth
of
their
doctrines
by
the
strong
arm
of
power
such
buildings
as
the
one
the
old
grey
ruins
of
which
were
situated
near
to
bannerworth
hall
were
erected
ostensibly
for
religious
purposes
but
really
as
a
stronghold
for
defence
as
well
as
for
aggression
this
monks'
hall
as
it
was
called
partook
quite
as
much
of
the
character
of
a
fortress
as
of
an
ecclesiastical
building
the
ruins
covered
a
considerable
extent
of
ground
but
the
only
part
which
seemed
successfully
to
have
resisted
the
encroaches
of
time
at
least
to
a
considerable
extent
was
a
long
hall
in
which
the
jolly
monks
no
doubt
feasted
and
caroused
adjoining
to
this
hall
were
the
walls
of
other
parts
of
the
building
and
at
several
places
there
were
small
low
mysterious-looking
doors
that
led
heaven
knows
where
into
some
intricacies
and
labyrinths
beneath
the
building
which
no
one
had
within
the
memory
of
man
been
content
to
run
the
risk
of
losing
himself
in
illustration
it
was
related
that
among
these
subterranean
passages
and
arches
there
were
pitfalls
and
pools
of
water
and
whether
such
a
statement
was
true
or
not
it
certainly
acted
as
a
considerable
damper
upon
the
vigour
of
curiosity
this
ruin
was
so
well
known
in
the
neighbourhood
and
had
become
from
earliest
childhood
so
familiar
to
the
inhabitants
of
bannerworth
hall
that
one
would
as
soon
expect
an
old
inhabitant
of
ludgate-hill
to
make
some
remark
about
st
paul's
as
any
of
them
to
allude
to
the
ruins
of
monks'
hall
they
never
now
thought
of
going
near
to
it
for
in
infancy
they
had
spoiled
among
its
ruins
and
it
had
become
one
of
those
familiar
objects
which
almost
from
that
very
familiarity
cease
to
hold
a
place
in
the
memories
of
those
who
know
it
so
well
it
is
however
to
this
ruin
we
would
now
conduct
our
readers
premising
that
what
we
have
to
say
concerning
it
now
is
not
precisely
in
the
form
of
a
connected
portion
of
our
narrative





it
is
evening--the
evening
of
that
first
day
of
heart
loneliness
to
poor
flora
bannerworth
the
lingering
rays
of
the
setting
sun
are
gilding
the
old
ruins
with
a
wondrous
beauty
the
edges
of
the
decayed
stones
seem
now
to
be
tipped
with
gold
and
as
the
rich
golden
refulgence
of
light
gleams
upon
the
painted
glass
which
still
adorned
a
large
window
of
the
hall
a
flood
of
many-coloured
beautiful
light
was
cast
within
making
the
old
flag-stones
with
which
the
interior
was
paved
look
more
like
some
rich
tapestry
laid
down
to
do
honour
to
a
monarch
so
picturesque
and
so
beautiful
an
aspect
did
the
ancient
ruin
wear
that
to
one
with
a
soul
to
appreciate
the
romantic
and
the
beautiful
it
would
have
amply
repaid
the
fatigue
of
a
long
journey
now
to
see
it
and
as
the
sun
sank
to
rest
the
gorgeous
colours
that
it
cast
upon
the
mouldering
wall
deepened
from
an
appearance
of
burnished
gold
to
a
crimson
hue
and
from
that
again
the
colour
changed
to
a
shifting
purple
mingling
with
the
shadows
of
the
evening
and
so
gradually
fading
away
into
absolute
darkness
the
place
is
as
silent
as
the
tomb--a
silence
far
more
solemn
than
could
have
existed
had
there
been
no
remains
of
a
human
habitation
because
even
these
time-worn
walls
were
suggestive
of
what
once
had
been
and
the
wrapt
stillness
which
now
pervaded
them
brought
with
them
a
melancholy
feeling
for
the
past
there
was
not
even
the
low
hum
of
insect
life
to
break
the
stillness
of
these
ancient
ruins
and
now
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
are
gradually
fading
away
in
a
short
time
all
will
be
darkness
a
low
gentle
wind
is
getting
up
and
beginning
slightly
to
stir
the
tall
blades
of
grass
that
have
shot
up
between
some
of
the
old
stones
the
silence
is
broken
awfully
broken
by
a
sudden
cry
of
despair
such
a
cry
as
might
come
from
some
imprisoned
spirit
doomed
to
waste
an
age
of
horror
in
a
tomb
and
yet
it
was
scarcely
to
be
called
a
scream
and
not
all
a
groan
it
might
have
come
from
some
one
on
the
moment
of
some
dreadful
sacrifice
when
the
judgment
had
not
sufficient
time
to
call
courage
to
its
aid
but
involuntarily
had
induced
that
sound
which
might
not
be
repeated
a
few
startled
birds
flew
from
odd
holes
and
corners
about
the
ruins
to
seek
some
other
place
of
rest
the
owl
hooted
from
a
corner
of
what
had
once
been
a
belfry
and
a
dreamy-looking
bat
flew
out
from
a
cranny
and
struck
itself
headlong
against
a
projection
then
all
was
still
again
silence
resumed
its
reign
and
if
there
had
been
a
mortal
ear
to
drink
in
that
sudden
sound
the
mind
might
well
have
doubted
if
fancy
had
not
more
to
do
with
the
matter
than
reality
from
out
a
portion
of
the
ruins
that
was
enveloped
in
the
deepest
gloom
there
now
glides
a
figure
it
is
of
gigantic
height
and
it
moves
along
with
a
slow
and
measured
tread
an
ample
mantle
envelopes
the
form
which
might
well
have
been
taken
for
the
spirit
of
one
of
the
monks
who
centuries
since
had
made
that
place
their
home
it
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
ample
hall
we
have
alluded
to
and
then
at
the
window
from
which
had
streamed
the
long
flood
of
many
coloured
light
it
paused
for
more
than
ten
minutes
this
mysterious
looking
figure
there
stood
at
length
there
passed
something
on
the
outside
of
the
window
that
looked
like
the
shadow
of
a
human
form
then
the
tall
mysterious
apparition-looking
man
turned
and
sought
a
side
entrance
to
the
hall
then
he
paused
and
in
about
a
minute
he
was
joined
by
another
who
must
have
been
he
who
had
so
recently
passed
the
stained
glass
window
on
the
outer
side
there
was
a
friendly
salutation
between
these
two
beings
and
they
walked
to
the
centre
of
the
hall
where
they
remained
for
some
time
in
animated
conversation
from
the
gestures
they
used
it
was
evident
that
the
subject
of
their
discourse
was
one
of
deep
and
absorbing
interest
to
both
it
was
one
too
upon
which
after
a
time
they
seemed
a
little
to
differ
and
more
than
once
they
each
assumed
attitudes
of
mutual
defiance
this
continued
until
the
sun
had
so
completely
sunk
that
twilight
was
beginning
sensibly
to
wane
and
then
gradually
the
two
men
appeared
to
have
come
to
a
better
understanding
and
whatever
might
be
the
subject
of
their
discourse
there
was
some
positive
result
evidently
arrived
at
now
they
spoke
in
lower
tones
they
used
less
animated
gestures
than
before
and
after
a
time
they
both
walked
slowly
down
the
hull
towards
the
dark
spot
from
whence
the
first
tall
figure
had
so
mysteriously
emerged





there
it
a
dungeon--damp
and
full
of
the
most
unwholesome
exhalations--deep
under
ground
it
seems
and
in
its
excavations
it
would
appear
as
if
some
small
land
springs
had
been
liberated
for
the
earthen
floor
was
one
continued
extent
of
moisture
from
the
roof
too
came
perpetually
the
dripping
of
water
which
fell
with
sullen
startling
splashes
in
the
pool
below
at
one
end
and
near
to
the
roof--so
near
that
to
reach
it
without
the
most
efficient
means
from
the
inside
was
a
matter
of
positive
impossibility--is
a
small
iron
grating
and
not
much
larger
than
might
be
entirely
obscured
by
any
human
face
that
might
be
close
to
it
from
the
outside
of
the
dungeon
that
dreadful
abode
is
tenanted
in
one
corner
on
a
heap
of
straw
which
appears
freshly
to
have
been
cast
into
the
place
lies
a
hopeless
prisoner
it
is
no
great
stretch
of
fancy
to
suppose
that
it
is
from
his
lips
came
the
sound
of
terror
and
of
woe
that
had
disturbed
the
repose
of
that
lonely
spot
the
prisoner
is
lying
on
his
back
a
rude
bandage
round
his
head
on
which
were
numerous
spots
of
blood
would
seem
to
indicate
that
he
had
suffered
personal
injury
in
some
recent
struggle
his
eyes
were
open
they
were
fixed
desparingly
perhaps
unconsciously
upon
that
small
grating
which
looked
into
the
upper
world
that
grating
slants
upwards
and
looks
to
the
west
so
that
any
one
confined
in
that
dreary
dungeon
might
be
tantalized
on
a
sweet
summer's
day
by
seeing
the
sweet
blue
sky
and
occasionally
the
white
clouds
flitting
by
in
that
freedom
which
he
cannot
hope
for
the
carol
of
a
bird
too
might
reach
him
there
alas
sad
remembrance
of
life
and
joy
and
liberty
but
now
all
is
deepening
gloom
the
prisoner
sees
nothing--hears
nothing
and
the
sky
is
not
quite
dark
that
small
grating
looks
like
a
strange
light-patch
in
the
dungeon
wall
hark
some
footstep
sounds
upon
his
ear
the
creaking
of
a
door
follows--a
gleam
of
light
shines
into
the
dungeon
and
the
tall
mysterious-looking
figure
in
the
cloak
stands
before
the
occupant
of
that
wretched
place
then
comes
in
the
other
man
and
he
carries
in
his
hand
writing
materials
he
stoops
to
the
stone
couch
on
which
the
prisoner
lies
and
offers
him
a
pen
as
he
raises
him
partially
from
the
miserable
damp
pallet
but
there
is
no
speculation
in
the
eyes
of
that
oppressed
man
in
vain
the
pen
is
repeatedly
placed
in
his
grasp
and
a
document
of
some
length
written
on
parchment
spread
out
before
him
to
sign
in
vain
is
he
held
up
now
by
both
the
men
who
have
thus
mysteriously
sought
him
in
his
dungeon
he
has
not
power
to
do
as
they
would
wish
him
the
pen
falls
from
his
nerveless
grasp
and
with
a
deep
sigh
when
they
cease
to
hold
him
up
he
falls
heavily
back
upon
the
stone
couch
then
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
for
about
a
minute
silently
after
which
he
who
was
the
shorter
of
the
two
raised
one
hand
and
in
a
voice
of
such
concentrated
hatred
and
passion
as
was
horrible
to
hear
he
said--
d--n
the
reply
of
the
other
was
a
laugh
and
then
he
took
the
light
from
the
floor
and
motioned
the
one
who
seemed
so
little
able
to
control
his
feelings
of
bitterness
and
disappointment
to
leave
the
place
with
him
with
a
haste
and
vehemence
then
which
showed
how
much
angered
he
was
the
shorter
man
of
the
two
now
rolled
up
the
parchment
and
placed
it
in
a
breast-pocket
of
his
coat
he
cast
a
withering
look
of
intense
hatred
on
the
form
of
the
nearly-unconscious
prisoner
and
then
prepared
to
follow
the
other
but
when
they
reached
the
door
of
the
dungeon
the
taller
man
of
the
two
paused
and
appeared
for
a
moment
or
two
to
be
in
deep
thought
after
which
he
handed
the
lamp
he
carried
to
his
companion
and
approached
the
pallet
of
the
prisoner
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
bottle
and
raising
the
head
of
the
feeble
and
wounded
man
he
poured
some
portion
of
the
contents
into
his
mouth
and
watched
him
swallow
it
the
other
looked
on
in
silence
and
then
they
both
slowly
left
the
dreary
dungeon



the
wind
rose
and
the
night
had
deepened
into
the
utmost
darkness
the
blackness
of
a
night
unillumined
by
the
moon
which
would
not
now
rise
for
some
hours
was
upon
the
ancient
ruins
all
was
calm
and
still
and
no
one
would
have
supposed
that
aught
human
was
within
those
ancient
dreary
looking
walls
time
will
show
who
it
was
who
lay
in
that
unwholesome
dungeon
as
well
as
who
were
they
who
visited
him
so
mysteriously
and
retired
again
with
feelings
of
such
evident
disappointment
with
the
document
it
seemed
of
such
importance
at
least
to
one
of
them
to
get
that
unconscious
man
to
sign
the
visit
of
flora
to
the
vampyre--the
offer--the
solemn
asseveration
illustration
admiral
bell
had
of
course
nothing
particular
to
communicate
to
flora
in
the
walk
he
induced
her
to
take
with
him
in
the
gardens
of
bannerworth
hall
but
he
could
talk
to
her
upon
a
subject
which
was
sure
to
be
a
welcome
one
namely
of
charles
holland
and
not
only
could
he
talk
to
her
of
charles
but
he
was
willing
to
talk
of
him
in
the
style
of
enthusiastic
commendation
which
assimilated
best
with
her
own
feelings
no
one
but
the
honest
old
admiral
who
was
as
violent
in
his
likes
and
his
dislikes
as
any
one
could
possibly
be
could
just
then
have
conversed
with
flora
bannerworth
to
her
satisfaction
of
charles
holland
he
expressed
no
doubts
whatever
concerning
charles's
faith
and
to
his
mind
now
that
he
had
got
that
opinion
firmly
fixed
in
his
mind
everybody
that
held
a
contrary
one
he
at
once
denounced
as
a
fool
or
a
rogue
never
you
mind
miss
flora
he
said
you
will
find
i
dare
say
that
all
will
come
right
eventually
d--n
me
the
only
thing
that
provokes
me
in
the
whole
business
is
that
i
should
have
been
such
an
old
fool
as
for
a
moment
to
doubt
charles
you
should
have
known
him
better
sir
i
should
my
dear
but
i
was
taken
by
surprise
you
see
and
that
was
wrong
too
for
a
man
who
has
held
a
responsible
command
but
the
circumstances
dear
sir
were
of
a
nature
to
take
every
one
by
surprise
they
were
they
were
but
now
candidly
speaking
and
i
know
i
can
speak
candidly
to
you
do
you
really
think
this
varney
is
the
vampyre
i
do
you
do
well
then
somebody
must
tackle
him
that's
quite
clear
we
can't
put
up
with
his
fancies
always
what
can
be
done
ah
that
i
don't
know
but
something
must
be
done
you
know
he
wants
this
place
heaven
only
knows
why
or
wherefore
he
has
taken
such
a
fancy
to
it
but
he
has
done
so
that
is
quite
clear
if
it
had
a
good
sea
view
i
should
not
be
so
much
surprised
but
there's
nothing
of
the
sort
so
it's
no
way
at
all
better
than
any
other
shore-going
stupid
sort
of
house
that
you
can
see
nothing
but
land
from
oh
if
my
brother
would
but
make
some
compromise
with
him
to
restore
charles
to
us
and
take
the
house
we
might
yet
be
happy
d--n
it
then
you
still
think
that
he
has
a
hand
in
spiriting
away
charles
who
else
could
do
so
i'll
be
hanged
if
i
know
i
do
feel
tolerably
sure
and
i
have
good
deal
of
reliance
upon
your
opinion
my
dear
i
say
i
do
feel
tolerably
sure
but
if
i
was
d----d
sure
now
i'd
soon
have
it
out
of
him
for
my
sake
admiral
bell
i
wish
now
to
extract
one
promise
from
you
say
your
say
my
dear
and
i'll
promise
you
you
will
not
then
expose
yourself
to
the
danger
of
any
personal
conflict
with
that
most
dreadful
man
whose
powers
of
mischief
we
do
not
know
and
therefore
cannot
well
meet
or
appreciate
whew
is
that
what
you
mean
yes
you
will
i
am
sure
promise
me
so
much
why
my
dear
you
see
the
case
is
this
in
affairs
of
fighting
the
less
ladies
interfere
the
better
nay
why
so
because--because
you
see
a
lady
has
no
reputation
for
courage
to
keep
up
indeed
it's
rather
the
other
way
for
we
dislike
a
bold
woman
as
much
as
we
hold
in
contempt
a
cowardly
man
but
if
you
grant
to
us
females
that
in
consequence
of
our
affections
we
are
not
courageous
you
must
likewise
grant
how
much
we
are
doomed
to
suffer
from
the
dangers
of
those
whom
we
esteem
you
would
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
esteem
a
coward
certainly
but
there
is
more
true
courage
often
in
not
fighting
than
in
entering
into
a
contest
you
are
right
enough
there
my
dear
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
should
not
oppose
your
carrying
out
the
dictates
of
your
honour
but
now
let
me
entreat
you
not
to
meet
this
dreadful
man
if
man
he
can
be
called
when
you
know
not
how
unfair
the
contest
may
be
unfair
yes
may
he
not
have
some
means
of
preventing
you
from
injuring
him
and
of
overcoming
you
which
no
mortal
possesses
he
may
then
the
supposition
of
such
a
case
ought
to
be
sufficient
ground
for
at
once
inducing
you
to
abandon
all
idea
of
meeting
with
him
my
dear
i'll
consider
of
this
matter
do
so
there
is
another
thing
however
which
now
you
will
permit
me
to
ask
of
you
as
a
favour
it
is
granted
ere
it
is
spoken
very
good
now
you
must
not
be
offended
with
what
i
am
going
to
say
because
however
it
may
touch
that
very
proper
pride
which
you
and
such
as
you
are
always
sure
to
possess
you
are
fortunately
at
all
times
able
to
call
sufficient
judgment
to
your
aid
to
enable
you
to
see
what
is
really
offensive
and
what
is
not
you
alarm
me
by
such
a
preface
do
i
then
here
goes
at
once
your
brother
henry
poor
fellow
has
enough
to
do
has
he
not
to
make
all
ends
meet
a
flush
of
excitement
came
over
flora's
cheek
as
the
old
admiral
thus
bluntly
broached
a
subject
of
which
she
already
knew
the
bitterness
to
such
a
spirit
as
her
brother's
you
are
silent
continued
the
old
man
by
that
i
guess
i
am
not
wrong
in
my
i
supposition
indeed
it
is
hardly
a
supposition
at
all
for
master
charles
told
me
as
much
and
no
doubt
he
had
it
from
a
correct
quarter
i
cannot
deny
it
sir
then
don't
it
ain't
worth
denying
my
dear
poverty
is
no
crime
but
like
being
born
a
frenchman
it's
a
d----d
misfortune
flora
could
scarcely
refuse
a
smile
as
the
nationality
of
the
old
admiral
peeped
out
even
in
the
midst
of
his
most
liberal
and
best
feelings
well
he
continued
i
don't
intend
that
he
shall
have
so
much
trouble
as
he
has
had
the
enemies
of
his
king
and
his
country
shall
free
him
from
his
embarrassments
the
enemies
yes
who
else
you
speak
in
riddles
sir
do
i
then
i'll
soon
make
the
riddles
plain
when
i
went
to
sea
i
was
worth
nothing--as
poor
as
a
ship's
cat
after
the
crew
had
been
paid
off
for
a
month
well
i
began
fighting
away
as
hard
and
fast
as
i
could
and
the
more
i
fought
and
the
more
hard
knocks
i
gave
and
took
the
more
money
i
got
indeed
yes
prize
after
prize
we
hauled
into
port
and
at
last
the
french
vessels
wouldn't
come
out
of
their
harbours
what
did
you
do
then
what
did
we
do
then
why
what
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
whole
world
for
us
to
do
we
did
i
cannot
guess
well
i
am
surprised
at
that
try
again
oh
yes
i
can
guess
now
how
could
i
have
been
so
dull
you
went
and
took
them
out
to
be
sure
we
did--to
be
sure
we
did
my
dear
that's
how
we
managed
them
and
do
you
see
at
the
end
of
the
war
i
found
myself
with
lots
of
prize
money
all
wrung
from
old
england's
enemies
and
i
intend
that
some
of
it
shall
find
it's
way
to
your
brother's
pocket
and
you
see
that
will
bear
out
just
what
i
said
that
the
enemies
of
his
king
and
his
country
shall
free
him
from
his
difficulties--don't
you
see
i
see
your
noble
generosity
admiral
noble
fiddlestick
now
i
have
mentioned
this
matter
to
you
my
dear
and
i
don't
so
much
mind
talking
to
you
about
such
matters
as
i
should
to
your
brother
i
want
you
to
do
me
the
favour
of
managing
it
all
for
me
how
sir
why
just
this
way
you
must
find
out
how
much
money
will
free
your
brother
just
now
from
a
parcel
of
botherations
that
beset
him
and
then
i
will
give
it
to
you
and
you
can
hand
it
to
him
you
see
so
i
need
not
say
anything
about
it
and
if
he
speaks
to
me
on
the
subject
at
all
i
can
put
him
down
at
once
by
saying
'avast
there
it's
no
business
of
mine'
and
can
you
dear
admiral
imagine
that
i
could
conceal
the
generous
source
from
where
so
much
assistance
came
of
course
it
will
come
from
you
i
take
a
fancy
to
make
you
a
present
of
a
sum
of
money
you
do
with
it
what
you
please--it's
yours
and
i
have
no
right
and
no
inclination
to
ask
you
what
use
you
put
it
to
tears
gushed
from
the
eyes
of
flora
as
she
tried
to
utter
some
word
but
could
not
the
admiral
swore
rather
fearfully
and
pretended
to
wonder
much
what
on
earth
she
could
be
crying
for
at
length
after
the
first
gush
of
feeling
was
over
she
said--
i
cannot
accept
of
so
much
generosity
sir--i
dare
not
dare
not
no
i
should
think
meanly
of
myself
were
i
to
take
advantage
of
the
boundless
munificence
of
your
nature
take
advantage
i
should
like
to
see
anybody
take
advantage
of
me
that's
all
i
ought
not
to
take
the
money
of
you
i
will
speak
to
my
brother
and
well
i
know
how
much
he
will
appreciate
the
noble
generous
offer
my
dear
sir
well
settle
it
your
own
way
only
remember
i
have
a
right
to
do
what
i
like
with
my
own
money
undoubtedly
very
good
then
as
that
is
undoubted
whatever
i
lend
to
him
mind
i
give
to
you
so
it's
as
broad
as
it's
long
as
the
dutchman
said
when
he
looked
at
the
new
ship
that
was
built
for
him
and
you
may
as
well
take
it
yourself
you
see
and
make
no
more
fuss
about
it
i
will
consider
said
flora
with
much
emotion--between
this
time
and
the
same
hour
to-morrow
i
will
consider
sir
and
if
you
can
find
any
words
more
expressive
of
heartfelt
gratitude
than
others
pray
imagine
that
i
have
used
them
with
reference
to
my
own
feelings
towards
you
for
such
an
unexampled
offer
of
friendship
oh
bother--stuff
the
admiral
now
at
once
changed
the
subject
and
began
to
talk
of
charles--a
most
grateful
theme
to
flora
as
may
well
be
supposed
he
related
to
her
many
little
particulars
connected
with
him
which
all
tended
to
place
his
character
in
a
most
amiable
light
and
as
her
ears
drank
in
the
words
of
commendation
of
him
she
loved
what
sweeter
music
could
there
be
to
her
than
the
voice
of
that
old
weather-beaten
rough-spoken
man
the
idea
he
added
to
a
warm
eulogium
he
had
uttered
concerning
charles--the
idea
that
he
could
write
those
letters
my
dear
is
quite
absurd
it
is
indeed
oh
that
we
could
know
what
had
become
of
him
we
shall
know
i
don't
think
but
what
he's
alive
something
seems
to
assure
me
that
we
shall
some
of
these
days
look
upon
his
face
again
i
am
rejoiced
to
hear
you
say
so
we
will
stir
heaven
and
earth
to
find
him
if
he
were
killed
do
you
see
there
would
have
been
some
traces
of
him
now
at
hand
besides
he
would
have
been
left
lying
where
the
rascals
attacked
him
flora
shuddered
but
don't
you
fret
yourself
you
may
depend
that
the
sweet
little
cherub
that
sits
up
aloft
has
looked
after
him
i
will
hope
so
and
now
my
dear
master
henry
will
soon
be
home
i
am
thinking
and
as
he
has
quite
enough
disagreeables
on
his
own
mind
to
be
able
to
spare
a
few
of
them
you
will
take
the
earliest
opportunity
i
am
sure
of
acquainting
him
with
the
little
matter
we
have
been
talking
about
and
let
me
know
what
he
says
i
will--i
will
that's
right
now
go
in
doors
for
there's
a
cold
air
blowing
here
and
you
are
a
delicate
plant
rather
just
now--go
in
and
make
yourself
comfortable
and
easy
the
worst
storm
must
blow
over
at
last
sir
francis
varney
and
his
mysterious
visitor--the
strange
conference
sir
francis
varney
is
in
what
he
calls
his
own
apartment
it
is
night
and
a
dim
and
uncertain
light
from
a
candle
which
has
been
long
neglected
only
serves
to
render
obscurity
more
perplexing
the
room
is
a
costly
one
one
replete
with
all
the
appliances
of
refinement
and
luxury
which
the
spirit
and
the
genius
of
the
age
could
possibly
supply
him
with
but
there
is
upon
his
brow
the
marks
of
corroding
care
and
little
does
that
most
mysterious
being
seem
to
care
for
all
the
rich
furnishing
of
that
apartment
in
which
he
sits
his
cadaverous-looking
face
is
even
paler
and
more
death-like-looking
than
usual
and
if
it
can
be
conceived
possible
that
such
an
one
can
feel
largely
interested
in
human
affairs
to
look
at
him
we
could
well
suppose
that
some
interest
of
no
common
magnitude
was
at
stake
occasionally
too
he
muttered
some
unconnected
words
no
doubt
mentally
filling
up
the
gaps
which
rendered
the
sentences
incomplete
and
being
unconscious
perhaps
that
he
was
giving
audible
utterance
to
any
of
his
dark
and
secret
meditations
at
length
he
rose
and
with
an
anxious
expression
of
countenance
he
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
all
was
still
and
not
an
object
was
visible
it
was
that
pitchy
darkness
without
which
for
some
hours
when
the
moon
is
late
in
lending
her
reflected
beams
comes
over
the
earth's
surface
it
is
near
the
hour
he
muttered
it
is
now
very
near
the
hour
surely
he
will
come
and
yet
i
know
not
why
i
should
fear
him
although
i
seem
to
tremble
at
the
thought
of
his
approach
he
will
surely
come
once
a
year--only
once
does
he
visit
me
and
then
'tis
but
to
take
the
price
which
he
has
compelled
me
to
pay
for
that
existence
which
but
for
him
had
been
long
since
terminated
sometimes
i
devoutly
wish
it
were
with
a
shudder
he
returned
to
the
seat
he
had
so
recently
left
and
there
for
some
time
he
appeared
to
meditate
in
silence
suddenly
now
a
clock
which
was
in
the
hall
of
that
mansion
he
had
purchased
sounded
the
hour
loudly
the
time
has
come
said
sir
francis
the
time
has
come
he
will
surely
soon
be
here
hark
hark
slowly
and
distinctly
he
counted
the
strokes
of
the
clock
and
when
they
had
ceased
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
surprise--
eleven
but
eleven
how
have
i
been
deceived
i
thought
the
hour
of
midnight
was
at
hand
he
hastily
consulted
the
watch
he
wore
and
then
he
indeed
found
that
whatever
he
had
been
looking
forward
to
with
dread
for
some
time
past
as
certain
to
ensue
at
or
about
twelve
o
clock
had
yet
another
hour
in
which
to
prey
upon
his
imagination
how
could
i
have
made
so
grievous
an
error
he
exclaimed
another
hour
of
suspense
and
wonder
as
to
whether
that
man
be
among
the
living
or
the
dead
i
have
thought
of
raising
my
hand
against
his
life
but
some
strange
mysterious
feeling
has
always
staid
me
and
i
have
let
him
come
and
go
freely
while
an
opportunity
might
well
have
served
me
to
put
such
a
design
into
execution
he
is
old
too--very
old
and
yet
he
keeps
death
at
a
distance
he
looked
pale
but
far
from
unwell
or
failing
when
last
i
saw
him
alas
a
whole
hour
yet
to
wait
i
would
that
this
interview
were
over
that
extremely
well
known
and
popular
disease
called
the
fidgets
now
began
indeed
to
torment
sir
francis
varney
he
could
not
sit--he
could
not
walk
and
somehow
or
another
he
never
once
seemed
to
imagine
that
from
the
wine
cup
he
should
experience
any
relief
although
upon
a
side
table
there
stood
refreshments
of
that
character
and
thus
some
more
time
passed
away
and
he
strove
to
cheat
it
of
its
weariness
by
thinking
of
a
variety
of
subjects
but
as
the
fates
would
have
it
there
seemed
not
one
agreeable
reminiscence
in
the
mind
of
that
most
inexplicable
man
and
the
more
he
plunged
into
the
recesses
of
memory
the
more
uneasy
not
to
say
almost
terrified
he
looked
and
became
a
shuddering
nervousness
came
across
him
and
for
a
few
moments
he
sat
as
if
he
were
upon
the
point
of
fainting
by
a
vigorous
effort
however
he
shook
this
off
and
then
placing
before
him
the
watch
which
now
indicated
about
the
quarter
past
eleven
he
strove
with
a
calmer
aspect
to
wait
the
coming
of
him
whose
presence
when
he
did
come
would
really
be
a
great
terror
since
the
very
thought
beforehand
produced
so
much
hesitation
and
apparent
dismay
in
order
too
if
possible
then
to
further
withdraw
himself
from
a
too
painful
consideration
of
those
terrors
which
in
due
time
the
reader
will
be
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
he
took
up
a
book
and
plunging
at
random
into
its
contents
he
amused
his
mind
for
a
time
with
the
following
brief
narrative--
the
wind
howled
round
the
gable
ends
of
bridport
house
in
sudden
and
furious
gusts
while
the
inmates
sat
by
the
fire-side
gazing
in
silence
upon
the
blazing
embers
of
the
huge
fire
that
shed
a
red
and
bright
light
all
over
the
immense
apartment
in
which
they
all
sat
it
was
an
ancient
looking
place
very
large
end
capable
of
containing
a
number
of
guests
several
were
present
an
aged
couple
were
seated
in
tall
high
straight-backed
chairs
they
were
the
owners
of
that
lordly
mansion
and
near
them
sat
two
young
maidens
of
surpassing
beauty
they
were
dissimilar
and
yet
there
was
a
slight
likeness
but
of
totally
different
complexions
the
one
had
tresses
of
raven
black
eyebrows
eyelashes
and
eyes
were
all
of
the
same
hue
she
was
a
beautiful
and
proud-looking
girl
her
complexion
clear
with
the
hue
of
health
upon
her
cheeks
while
a
smile
played
around
her
lips
the
glance
of
the
eye
was
sufficient
to
thrill
through
the
whole
soul
the
other
maiden
was
altogether
different
her
complexion
altogether
fairer--her
hair
of
sunny
chestnut
and
her
beautiful
hazel
eyes
were
shaded
by
long
brown
eyelashes
while
a
playful
smile
also
lit
up
her
countenance
she
was
the
younger
of
the
two
the
attention
of
the
two
young
maidens
had
been
directed
to
the
words
of
the
aged
owner
of
the
house
for
he
had
been
speaking
a
few
moments
before
there
were
several
other
persons
present
and
at
some
little
distance
were
many
of
the
domestics
who
were
not
denied
the
privilege
of
warmth
and
rest
in
the
presence
of
their
master
these
were
not
the
times
when
if
servants
sat
down
they
were
deemed
idle
but
the
daily
task
done
then
the
evening
hour
was
spent
by
the
fire-side
the
wind
howls
and
moans
said
an
aged
domestic
in
an
awful
manner
i
never
heard
the
like
it
seems
as
though
some
imprisoned
spirit
was
waiting
for
the
repose
that
had
been
denied
on
earth
said
the
old
lady
as
she
shifted
her
seat
and
gazed
steadily
on
the
fire
ay
said
her
aged
companion
it
is
a
windy
night
and
there
will
be
a
storm
before
long
or
i'm
mistaken
it
was
just
such
a
night
as
that
my
son
henry
left
his
home
said
mrs
bradley
just
such
another--only
it
had
the
addition
of
sleet
and
rain
the
old
man
sighed
at
the
mention
of
his
son's
name
a
tear
stood
in
the
eyes
of
the
maidens
while
one
looked
silently
at
the
other
and
seemed
to
exchange
glances
i
would
that
i
might
again
see
him
before
my
body
seeks
its
final
home
in
the
cold
remorseless
grave
mother
said
the
fairest
of
the
two
maidens
do
not
talk
thus
let
us
hope
that
we
yet
may
have
many
years
of
happiness
together
many
emma
yes
mamma
many
do
you
know
that
i
am
very
old
emma
very
old
indeed
considering
what
i
have
suffered
such
a
life
of
sorrow
and
ill
health
is
at
least
equal
to
thirty
years
added
to
my
life
you
may
have
deceived
yourself
aunt
said
the
other
maiden
at
all
events
you
cannot
count
upon
life
as
certain
for
the
strongest
often
go
first
while
those
who
seem
much
more
likely
to
fall
by
care
as
often
live
in
peace
and
happiness
but
i
lead
no
life
of
peace
and
happiness
while
henry
bradley
is
not
here
besides
my
life
might
be
passed
without
me
seeing
him
again
it
is
now
two
years
since
he
was
here
last
said
the
old
man
this
night
two
years
was
the
night
on
which
he
left
this
night
two
years
yes
it
was
this
night
two
years
said
one
of
the
servant
men
because
old
dame
poutlet
had
twins
on
that
night
a
memorable
circumstance
and
one
died
at
a
twelvemonth
old
said
the
man
and
she
had
a
dream
which
foretold
the
event
ay
ay
yes
and
moreover
she's
had
the
same
dream
again
last
wednesday
was
a
week
said
the
man
and
lost
the
other
twin
yes
sir
this
morning
omens
multiply
said
the
aged
man
i
would
that
it
would
seem
to
indicate
the
return
of
henry
to
his
home
i
wonder
where
he
can
have
gone
to
or
what
he
could
have
done
all
this
time
probably
he
may
not
be
in
the
land
of
the
living
poor
henry
said
emma
alas
poor
boy
we
may
never
see
him
again--it
was
a
mistaken
act
of
his
and
yet
he
knew
not
otherwise
how
to
act
or
escape
his
father's
displeasure
say
no
more--say
no
more
upon
that
subject
i
dare
not
listen
to
it
god
knows
i
know
quite
enough
said
mr
bradley
i
knew
not
he
would
have
taken
my
words
so
to
heart
as
he
did
why
said
the
old
woman
he
thought
you
meant
what
you
said
there
was
a
long
pause
during
which
all
gazed
at
the
blazing
fire
seemingly
wrapt
in
their
own
meditation
henry
bradley
the
son
of
the
apparently
aged
couple
had
left
that
day
two
years
and
wherefore
had
he
left
the
home
of
his
childhood
wherefore
had
he
the
heir
to
large
estates
done
this
he
had
dared
to
love
without
his
father's
leave
and
had
refused
the
offer
his
father
made
him
of
marrying
a
young
lady
whom
he
had
chosen
for
him
but
whom
he
could
not
love
it
was
as
much
a
matter
of
surprise
to
the
father
that
the
son
should
refuse
as
it
was
to
the
son
that
his
father
should
contemplate
such
a
match
henry
said
the
father
you
have
been
thought
of
by
me
i
have
made
proposals
for
marrying
you
to
the
daughter
of
our
neighbour
sir
arthur
onslow
indeed
father
yes
i
wish
you
to
go
there
with
me
to
see
the
young
lady
in
the
character
of
a
suitor
yes
replied
the
father
certainly
it's
high
time
you
were
settled
indeed
i
would
rather
not
go
father
i
have
no
intention
of
marrying
just
yet
i
do
not
desire
to
do
so
this
was
an
opposition
that
mr
bradley
had
not
expected
from
his
son
and
which
his
imperious
temper
could
ill
brook
and
with
a
darkened
brow
he
said--
it
is
not
much
henry
that
i
trespass
upon
your
obedience
but
when
i
do
so
i
expect
that
you
will
obey
me
but
father
this
matter
affects
me
for
my
whole
life
that
is
why
i
have
deliberated
so
long
and
carefully
over
it
but
it
is
not
unreasonable
that
i
should
have
a
voice
in
the
affair
father
since
it
may
render
me
miserable
you
shall
have
a
voice
then
i
say
no
to
the
whole
regulation
said
henry
decisively
if
you
do
so
you
forfeit
my
protection
much
more
favour
but
you
had
better
consider
over
what
you
have
said
forget
it
and
come
with
me
i
cannot
you
will
not
no
father
i
cannot
do
as
you
wish
me
my
mind
is
fully
made
up
upon
that
matter
illustration
and
so
is
mine
you
either
do
as
i
would
have
you
or
you
leave
the
house
and
seek
your
own
living
and
you
are
a
beggar
i
should
prefer
being
such
said
henry
than
to
marry
any
young
lady
and
be
unable
to
love
her
that
is
not
required
no
i
am
astonished
not
necessary
to
love
the
woman
you
marry
not
at
all
if
you
act
justly
towards
her
she
ought
to
be
grateful
and
it
is
all
that
is
requisite
in
the
marriage
state
gratitude
will
beget
love
and
love
in
one
begets
love
in
the
other
i
will
not
argue
with
you
father
upon
the
matter
you
are
a
better
judge
than
i
you
have
had
more
experience
i
have
and
it
would
be
useless
to
speak
upon
the
subject
but
of
this
i
can
speak--my
own
resolve--that
i
will
not
marry
the
lady
in
question
the
son
had
all
the
stern
resolve
of
the
father
but
he
had
also
very
good
reasons
for
what
he
did
he
loved
and
was
beloved
in
return
and
hence
he
would
not
break
his
faith
with
her
whom
he
loved
to
have
explained
this
to
his
father
would
have
been
to
gain
nothing
except
an
accession
of
anger
and
he
would
have
made
a
new
demand
upon
his
the
son's
obedience
by
ordering
him
to
discard
from
his
bosom
the
image
that
was
there
indelibly
engraven
you
will
not
marry
her
whom
i
have
chosen
for
your
bride
i
cannot
do
not
talk
to
me
of
can
and
can't
when
i
speak
of
will
and
wont
it
is
useless
to
disguise
the
fact
you
have
your
free
will
in
the
matter
i
shall
take
no
answer
but
yes
or
no
then
no
father
good
sir
and
now
we
are
strangers
with
that
mr
bradley
turned
abruptly
from
his
son
and
left
him
to
himself
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
any
words
of
difference
together
and
it
was
sudden
and
soon
terminated
henry
bradley
was
indignant
at
what
had
happened
he
did
not
think
his
father
would
have
acted
as
he
had
done
in
this
instance
but
he
was
too
much
interested
in
the
fate
of
another
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
then
came
the
consideration
as
to
what
he
should
do
now
that
he
had
arrived
at
such
a
climax
his
first
thoughts
turned
to
his
mother
and
sister
he
could
not
leave
the
house
without
bidding
them
good-bye
he
determined
to
see
his
mother
for
his
father
had
left
the
hall
upon
a
visit
mrs
bradley
and
emma
were
alone
when
he
entered
their
apartment
and
to
them
he
related
all
that
had
passed
between
himself
and
father
they
besought
him
to
stay
to
remain
there
or
at
least
in
the
neighbourhood
but
he
was
resolved
to
quit
the
place
altogether
for
a
time
as
he
could
do
nothing
there
and
he
might
chance
to
do
something
elsewhere
upon
this
they
got
together
all
the
money
and
such
jewels
as
they
could
spare
which
in
all
amounted
to
a
considerable
sum
then
taking
an
affectionate
leave
of
his
mother
and
sister
henry
left
the
hall--not
before
he
had
taken
a
long
and
affectionate
farewell
of
one
other
who
lived
within
those
walls
this
was
no
other
than
the
raven-eyed
maiden
who
sat
by
the
fire
side
and
listened
attentively
to
the
conversation
that
was
going
on
she
was
his
love--she
a
poor
cousin
for
her
sake
he
had
braved
all
his
father's
anger
and
attempted
to
seek
his
fortune
abroad
this
done
he
quietly
left
the
hall
without
giving
any
one
any
intimation
of
where
he
was
going
old
mr
bradley
when
he
had
said
so
much
to
his
son
was
highly
incensed
at
what
he
deemed
his
obstinacy
and
he
thought
the
threat
hanging
over
him
would
have
had
a
good
effect
but
he
was
amazed
when
he
discovered
that
henry
had
indeed
left
the
hall
and
he
knew
not
whither
for
some
time
he
comforted
himself
with
the
assurance
that
he
would
he
must
return
but
alas
he
came
not
and
this
was
the
second
anniversary
of
that
melancholy
day
which
no
one
more
repented
of
and
grieved
for
than
did
poor
mr
bradley
surely
surely
he
will
return
or
let
us
know
where
he
is
he
said
he
cannot
be
in
need
else
he
would
have
written
to
us
for
aid
no
no
said
mrs
bradley
it
is
i
fear
because
he
has
not
written
that
he
is
in
want
he
would
never
write
if
he
was
in
poverty
lest
he
should
cause
us
unhappiness
at
his
fate
were
he
doing
well
we
should
hear
of
it
for
he
would
be
proud
of
the
result
of
his
own
unaided
exertions
well
well
said
mr
bradley
i
can
say
no
more
if
i
was
hasty
so
was
he
but
it
is
passed
i
would
forgive
all
the
past
if
i
could
but
see
him
once
again--once
again
how
the
wind
howls
added
the
aged
man
and
it's
getting
worse
and
worse
yes
and
the
snow
is
coming
down
now
in
style
said
one
of
the
servants
who
brought
in
some
fresh
logs
which
were
piled
up
on
the
fire
and
he
shook
the
white
flakes
off
his
clothes
it
will
be
a
heavy
fall
before
morning
said
one
of
the
men
yes
it
has
been
gathering
for
some
days
it
will
be
much
warmer
than
it
has
been
when
it
is
all
down
so
it
will--so
it
will
at
that
moment
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
gate
and
the
dogs
burst
into
a
dreadful
uproar
from
their
kennels
go
robert
said
mr
bradley
and
see
who
it
is
that
knocks
such
a
night
as
this
it
is
not
fit
or
safe
that
a
dog
should
be
out
in
it
the
man
went
out
and
shortly
returned
saying--
so
please
you
sir
there
is
a
traveller
that
has
missed
his
way
and
desires
to
know
if
he
can
obtain
shelter
here
or
if
any
one
can
be
found
to
guide
him
to
the
nearest
inn
bid
him
come
in
we
shall
lose
no
warmth
because
there
is
one
more
before
the
fire
the
stranger
entered
and
said--i
have
missed
my
way
and
the
snow
comes
down
so
thick
and
fast
and
is
whirled
in
such
eddies
that
i
fear
by
myself
i
should
fall
into
some
drift
and
perish
before
morning
do
not
speak
of
it
sir
said
mr
bradley
such
a
night
as
this
is
a
sufficient
apology
for
the
request
you
make
and
an
inducement
to
me
to
grant
it
most
willingly
thanks
replied
the
stranger
the
welcome
is
most
seasonable
be
seated
sir
take
your
seat
by
the
ingle
it
is
warm
the
stranger
seated
himself
and
seemed
lost
in
reflection
as
he
gazed
intently
on
the
blazing
logs
he
was
a
robust
man
with
great
whiskers
and
beard
and
to
judge
from
his
outward
habiliments
he
was
a
stout
man
have
you
travelled
far
i
have
sir
you
appear
to
belong
to
the
army
if
i
mistake
not
i
do
sir
there
was
a
pause
the
stranger
seemed
not
inclined
to
speak
of
himself
much
but
mr
bradley
continued--
have
you
come
from
foreign
service
sir
i
presume
you
have
yes
i
have
not
been
in
this
country
more
than
six
days
indeed
shall
we
have
peace
think
you
i
do
so
and
i
hope
it
may
be
so
for
the
sake
of
many
who
desire
to
return
to
their
native
land
and
to
those
they
love
best
mr
bradley
heaved
a
deep
sigh
which
was
echoed
softly
by
all
present
and
the
stranger
looked
from
one
to
another
with
a
hasty
glance
and
then
turned
his
gaze
upon
the
fire
may
i
ask
sir
if
you
have
any
person
whom
you
regard
in
the
army--any
relative
alas
i
have--perhaps
i
ought
to
say
i
had
a
son
i
know
not
however
where
he
is
gone
oh
a
runaway
i
see
oh
no
he
left
because
there
were
some
family
differences
and
now
i
would
that
he
were
once
more
here
oh
said
the
stranger
softly
differences
and
mistakes
will
happen
now
and
then
when
least
desired
at
this
moment
an
old
hound
who
had
lain
beside
ellen
mowbray
she
who
wore
the
coal-black
tresses
lifted
his
head
at
the
difference
in
sound
that
was
noticed
in
the
stranger's
voice
he
got
up
and
slowly
walked
up
to
him
and
began
to
smell
around
him
and
in
another
moment
he
rushed
at
him
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
began
to
lick
and
caress
him
in
the
most
extravagant
manner
this
was
followed
by
a
cry
of
joy
in
all
present
it
is
henry
exclaimed
ellen
mowbray
rising
and
rushing
into
his
arms
it
was
henry
and
he
threw
off
the
several
coats
he
had
on
as
well
as
the
large
beard
he
wore
to
disguise
himself
the
meeting
was
a
happy
one
there
was
not
a
more
joyful
house
than
that
within
many
miles
around
henry
was
restored
to
the
arms
of
those
who
loved
him
and
in
a
month
a
wedding
was
celebrated
between
him
and
his
cousin
ellen





sir
francis
varney
glanced
at
his
watch
it
indicated
but
five
minutes
to
twelve
o'clock
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
even
as
he
did
so
a
loud
knocking
at
the
principal
entrance
to
his
house
awakened
every
echo
within
its
walls
the
thousand
pounds--the
stranger's
precautions
illustration
varney
moved
not
now
nor
did
he
speak
but
like
a
statue
he
stood
with
his
unearthly
looking
eyes
rivetted
upon
the
door
of
the
apartment
in
a
few
moments
one
of
his
servants
came
and
said--
sir
a
person
is
here
who
says
he
wants
to
see
you
he
desired
me
to
say
that
he
had
ridden
far
and
that
moments
were
precious
when
the
tide
of
life
was
ebbing
fast
yes
yes
gasped
varney
admit
him
i
know
him
bring
him
here
it
is--an--old
friend--of
mine
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
still
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
that
door
through
which
his
visitor
must
come
surely
some
secret
of
dreadful
moment
must
be
connected
with
him
whom
sir
francis
expected--dreaded--and
yet
dared
not
refuse
to
see
and
now
a
footstep
approaches--a
slow
and
a
solemn
footstep--it
pauses
a
moment
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
and
then
the
servant
flings
it
open
and
a
tall
man
enters
he
is
enveloped
in
the
folds
of
a
horseman's
cloak
and
there
is
the
clank
of
spurs
upon
his
heels
as
he
walks
into
the
room
varney
rose
again
but
he
said
not
a
word
and
for
a
few
moments
they
stood
opposite
each
other
in
silence
the
domestic
has
left
the
room
and
the
door
is
closed
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
conversing
and
yet
silent
they
continued
for
some
minutes
it
seemed
as
if
each
was
most
anxious
that
the
other
should
commence
the
conversation
first
and
yet
there
was
nothing
so
very
remarkable
in
the
appearance
of
that
stranger
which
should
entirely
justify
sir
francis
varney
in
feeling
so
much
alarm
at
his
presence
he
certainly
was
a
man
past
the
prime
of
life
and
he
looked
like
one
who
had
battled
much
with
misfortune
and
as
if
time
had
not
passed
so
lightly
over
his
brow
but
that
it
had
left
deep
traces
of
its
progress
the
only
thing
positively
bad
about
his
countenance
was
to
be
found
in
his
eyes
there
there
was
a
most
ungracious
and
sinister
expression
a
kind
of
lurking
and
suspicions
look
as
if
he
were
always
resolving
in
his
mind
some
deep
laid
scheme
which
might
be
sufficient
to
circumvent
the
whole
of
mankind
finding
probably
that
varney
would
not
speak
first
he
let
his
cloak
fall
more
loosely
about
him
and
in
a
low
deep
tone
he
said
i
presume
i
was
expected
you
were
said
varney
it
is
the
day
and
it
is
the
hour
you
are
right
i
like
to
see
you
so
mindful
you
don't
improve
in
looks
since--
hush--hush
no
more
of
that
can
we
not
meet
without
a
dreadful
allusion
to
the
past
there
needs
nothing
to
remind
me
of
it
and
your
presence
here
now
shows
that
you
are
not
forgetful
speak
not
of
that
fearful
episode
let
no
words
combine
to
place
it
in
a
tangible
shape
to
human
understanding
i
cannot
dare
not
hear
you
speak
of
that
it
is
well
said
the
stranger
as
you
please
let
our
interview
be
brief
you
know
my
errand
i
do
so
fearful
a
drag
upon
limited
means
is
not
likely
to
be
readily
forgotten
oh
you
are
too
ingenious--too
full
of
well
laid
schemes
and
to
apt
and
ready
in
their
execution
to
feel
as
any
fearful
drag
the
conditions
of
our
bargain
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
earnestly
because
said
varney--and
he
trembled
as
he
spoke--because
each
lineament
of
your
countenance
brings
me
back
to
the
recollection
of
the
only
scene
in
life
that
made
me
shudder
and
which
i
cannot
think
of
even
with
the
indifference
of
contempt
i
see
it
all
before
my
mind's
eye
coming
in
frightful
panoramic
array
those
incidents
which
even
to
dream
of
are
sufficient
to
drive
the
soul
to
madness
the
dread
of
this
annual
visit
hangs
upon
me
like
a
dark
cloud
upon
my
very
heart
it
sits
like
some
foul
incubus
destroying
its
vitality
and
dragging
me
from
day
to
day
nearer
to
that
tomb
from
whence
not
as
before
i
can
emerge
you
have
been
among
the
dead
said
the
stranger
i
have
and
yet
are
mortal
yes
repeated
varney
yes
and
yet
am
mortal
it
was
i
that
plucked
you
back
to
that
world
which
to
judge
from
your
appearance
has
had
since
that
eventful
period
but
few
charms
for
you
by
my
faith
you
look
like--
like
what
i
am
interrupted
varney
this
is
a
subject
that
once
a
year
gets
frightfully
renewed
between
us
for
weeks
before
your
visit
i
am
haunted
by
frightful
recollections
and
it
takes
me
many
weeks
after
you
are
gone
before
i
can
restore
myself
to
serenity
look
at
me
am
i
not
an
altered
man
in
faith
you
are
said
the
stranger
i
have
no
wish
to
press
upon
you
painful
recollections
and
yet
'tis
strange
to
me
that
upon
such
a
man
as
you
the
event
to
which
you
allude
should
produce
so
terrible
an
impression
i
have
passed
through
the
agony
of
death
said
varney
and
have
again
endured
the
torture--for
it
is
such--of
the
re-union
of
the
body
and
the
soul
not
having
endured
so
much
not
the
faintest
echo
of
such
feelings
can
enter
into
your
imagination
there
may
be
truth
in
that
and
yet
like
a
fluttering
moth
round
a
flame
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
do
see
you
you
take
a
terrific
kind
of
satisfaction
in
talking
of
the
past
that
is
strictly
true
said
varney
the
images
with
which
my
mind
is
filled
are
frightful
pent
up
do
they
remain
for
twelve
long
months
i
can
speak
to
you
and
you
only
without
disguise
and
thus
does
it
seem
to
me
that
i
get
rid
of
the
uneasy
load
of
horrible
imaginings
when
you
are
gone
and
have
been
gone
a
sufficient
lapse
of
time
my
slumbers
are
not
haunted
with
frightful
images--i
regain
a
comparative
peace
until
the
time
slowly
comes
around
again
when
we
are
doomed
to
meet
i
understand
you
you
seem
well
lodged
here
i
have
ever
kept
my
word
and
sent
to
you
telling
you
where
i
am
you
have
truly
i
have
no
shadow
of
complaint
to
make
against
you
no
one
could
have
more
faithfully
performed
his
bond
than
you
have
i
give
you
ample
credit
for
all
that
and
long
may
you
live
still
to
perform
your
conditions
i
dare
not
deceive
you
although
to
keep
such
faith
i
may
be
compelled
to
deceive
a
hundred
others
of
that
i
cannot
judge
fortune
seems
to
smile
upon
you
you
have
not
as
yet
disappointed
me
and
will
not
now
said
varney
the
gigantic
and
frightful
penalty
of
disappointing
you
stares
me
in
the
face
i
dare
not
do
so
he
took
from
his
pocket
as
he
spoke
a
clasped
book
from
which
he
produced
several
bank
notes
which
he
placed
before
the
stranger
a
thousand
pounds
he
said
that
is
the
agreement
it
is
to
the
very
letter
i
do
not
return
to
you
a
thousand
thanks--we
understand
each
other
better
than
to
waste
time
with
idle
compliment
indeed
i
will
go
quite
as
far
as
to
say
truthfully
that
did
not
my
necessities
require
this
amount
from
you
you
should
have
the
boon
for
which
you
pay
that
price
at
a
much
cheaper
rate
enough
enough
said
varney
it
is
strange
that
your
face
should
have
been
the
last
i
saw
when
the
world
closed
upon
me
and
the
first
that
met
my
eyes
when
i
was
again
snatched
back
to
life
do
you
pursue
still
your
dreadful
trade
yes
said
the
stranger
for
another
year
and
then
with
such
a
moderate
competence
as
fortune
has
assigned
me
i
retire
to
make
way
for
younger
and
abler
spirits
and
then
said
varney
shall
you
still
require
of
me
such
an
amount
as
this
no
this
is
my
last
visit
but
one
i
shall
be
just
and
liberal
towards
you
you
are
not
old
and
i
have
no
wish
to
become
the
clog
of
your
existence
as
i
have
before
told
you
it
is
my
necessity
and
not
my
inclination
that
sets
the
value
upon
the
service
i
rendered
you
i
understand
you
and
ought
to
thank
you
and
in
reply
to
so
much
courtesy
be
assured
that
when
i
shudder
at
your
presence
it
is
not
that
i
regard
you
with
horror
as
an
individual
but
it
is
because
the
sight
of
you
awakens
mournfully
the
remembrance
of
the
past
it
is
clear
to
me
said
the
stranger
and
now
i
think
we
part
with
each
other
in
a
better
spirit
than
we
ever
did
before
and
when
we
meet
again
the
remembrance
that
it
is
the
last
time
will
clear
away
the
gloom
that
i
now
find
hanging
over
you
it
may
it
may
with
what
an
earnest
gaze
you
still
regard
me
i
do
it
does
appear
to
me
most
strange
that
time
should
not
have
obliterated
the
effects
which
i
thought
would
have
ceased
with
their
cause
you
are
no
more
the
man
that
in
my
recollection
you
once
were
than
i
am
like
a
sporting
child
and
i
never
shall
be
said
varney
never--never
again
this
self-same
look
which
the
hand
of
death
had
placed
upon
me
i
shall
ever
wear
i
shudder
at
myself
and
as
i
oft
perceive
the
eye
of
idle
curiosity
fixed
steadfastly
upon
me
i
wonder
in
my
inmost
heart
if
even
the
wildest
guesser
hits
upon
the
cause
why
i
am
not
like
unto
other
men
no
of
that
you
may
depend
there
is
no
suspicion
but
i
will
leave
you
now
we
part
such
friends
as
men
situated
as
we
are
can
be
once
again
shall
we
meet
and
then
farewell
for
ever
do
you
leave
england
then
i
do
you
know
my
situation
in
life
it
is
not
one
which
offers
me
inducements
to
remain
in
some
other
land
i
shall
win
the
respect
and
attention
i
may
not
hope
for
here
there
my
wealth
will
win
many
golden
opinions
and
casting
as
best
i
may
the
veil
of
forgetfulness
over
my
former
life
my
declining
years
may
yet
be
happy
this
money
that
i
have
had
of
you
from
time
to
time
has
been
more
pleasantly
earned
than
all
beside
wrung
as
it
has
been
from
your
fears
still
have
i
taken
it
with
less
reproach
and
now
farewell
varney
rang
for
a
servant
to
show
the
stranger
from
the
house
and
without
another
word
they
parted
then
when
he
was
alone
that
mysterious
owner
of
that
costly
home
drew
a
long
breath
of
apparently
exquisite
relief
that
is
over--that
is
over
he
said
he
shall
have
the
other
thousand
pounds
perchance
sooner
than
he
thinks
with
all
expedition
i
will
send
it
to
him
and
then
on
that
subject
i
shall
be
at
peace
i
shall
have
paid
a
large
sum
but
that
which
i
purchased
was
to
me
priceless
it
was
my
life--it
was
my
life
itself
that
possession
which
the
world's
wealth
cannot
restore
and
shall
i
grudge
these
thousands
which
have
found
their
way
into
this
man's
hands
no
'tis
true
that
existence
for
me
has
lost
some
of
its
most
resplendent
charms
'tis
true
that
i
have
no
earthly
affections
and
that
shunning
companionship
with
all
i
am
alike
shunned
by
all
and
yet
while
the
life-blood
still
will
circulate
within
my
shrunken
veins
i
cling
to
vitality
he
passed
into
an
inner
room
and
taking
from
a
hook
on
which
it
hung
a
long
dark-coloured
cloak
he
enveloped
his
tall
unearthly
figure
within
its
folds
then
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
passed
out
of
his
house
and
appeared
to
be
taking
his
way
towards
bannerworth
house
surely
it
must
be
guilt
of
no
common
die
that
could
oppress
a
man
so
destitute
of
human
sympathies
as
sir
francis
varney
the
dreadful
suspicions
that
hovered
round
him
with
respect
to
what
he
was
appeared
to
gather
confirmation
from
every
act
of
his
existence
whether
or
not
this
man
to
whom
he
felt
bound
to
pay
annually
so
large
a
sum
was
in
the
secret
and
knew
him
to
be
something
more
than
earthly
we
cannot
at
present
declare
but
it
would
seem
from
the
tenor
of
their
conversation
as
if
such
were
the
fact
perchance
he
had
saved
him
from
the
corruption
of
the
tomb
by
placing
out
on
some
sylvan
spot
where
the
cold
moonbeams
fell
the
apparently
lifeless
form
and
now
claimed
so
large
a
reward
for
such
a
service
and
the
necessary
secrecy
contingent
upon
it
we
say
this
may
be
so
and
yet
again
some
more
natural
and
rational
explanation
may
unexpectedly
present
itself
and
there
may
be
yet
a
dark
page
in
sir
francis
varney's
life's
volume
which
will
place
him
in
a
light
of
superadded
terrors
to
our
readers
time
and
the
now
rapidly
accumulating
incidents
of
our
tale
will
soon
tear
aside
the
veil
of
mystery
that
now
envelopes
some
of
our
dramatis
personae
and
let
us
hope
that
in
the
development
of
those
incidents
we
shall
be
enabled
to
rescue
the
beautiful
flora
bannerworth
from
the
despairing
gloom
that
is
around
her
let
us
hope
and
even
anticipate
that
we
shall
see
her
smile
again
that
the
roseate
hue
of
health
will
again
revisit
her
cheeks
the
light
buoyancy
of
her
step
return
and
that
as
before
she
may
be
the
joy
of
all
around
her
dispensing
and
receiving
happiness
and
he
too
that
gallant
fearless
lover
he
whom
no
chance
of
time
or
tide
could
sever
from
the
object
of
his
fond
affections
he
who
listened
to
nothing
but
the
dictates
of
his
heart's
best
feelings
let
us
indulge
a
hope
that
he
will
have
a
bright
reward
and
that
the
sunshine
of
a
permanent
felicity
will
only
seem
the
brighter
for
the
shadows
that
for
a
time
have
obscured
its
glory
the
strange
interview--the
chase
through
the
hall
illustration
it
was
with
the
most
melancholy
aspect
that
anything
human
could
well
bear
that
sir
francis
varney
took
his
lonely
walk
although
perhaps
in
saying
so
much
probably
we
are
instituting
a
comparison
which
circumstances
scarcely
empower
us
to
do
for
who
shall
say
that
that
singular
man
around
whom
a
very
atmosphere
of
mystery
seemed
to
be
perpetually
increasing
was
human
averse
as
we
are
to
believe
in
the
supernatural
or
even
to
invest
humanity
with
any
preternatural
powers
the
more
than
singular
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
existence
and
the
acts
of
that
man
bring
to
the
mind
a
kind
of
shuddering
conviction
that
if
he
be
indeed
really
mortal
he
still
must
possess
some
powers
beyond
ordinary
mortality
and
be
walking
the
earth
for
some
unhallowed
purposes
such
as
ordinary
men
with
the
ordinary
attributes
of
human
nature
can
scarcely
guess
at
silently
and
alone
he
took
his
way
through
that
beautiful
tract
of
country
comprehending
such
picturesque
charms
of
hill
and
dale
which
lay
between
his
home
and
bannerworth
hall
he
was
evidently
intent
upon
reaching
the
latter
place
by
the
shortest
possible
route
and
in
the
darkness
of
that
night
for
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
he
showed
no
slight
acquaintance
with
the
intricacies
of
that
locality
that
he
was
at
all
enabled
to
pursue
so
undeviatingly
a
tract
as
that
which
he
took
he
muttered
frequently
to
himself
low
indistinct
words
as
he
went
and
chiefly
did
they
seem
to
have
reference
to
that
strange
interview
he
had
so
recently
had
with
one
who
from
some
combination
of
circumstances
scarcely
to
be
guessed
at
evidently
exercised
a
powerful
control
over
him
and
was
enabled
to
make
a
demand
upon
his
pecuniary
resources
of
rather
startling
magnitude
and
yet
from
a
stray
word
or
two
which
were
pronounced
more
distinctly
he
did
not
seem
to
be
thinking
in
anger
over
that
interview
but
it
would
appear
that
it
rather
had
recalled
to
his
remembrance
circumstances
of
a
painful
and
a
degrading
nature
which
time
had
not
been
able
entirely
to
obliterate
from
his
recollection
yes
yes
he
said
as
he
paused
upon
the
margin
of
the
wood
to
the
confines
of
which
he
or
what
seemed
to
be
he
had
once
been
chased
by
marchdale
and
the
bannerworths--yes
the
very
sight
of
that
man
recalls
all
the
frightful
pageantry
of
a
horrible
tragedy
which
i
can
never--never
forget
never
can
it
escape
my
memory
as
a
horrible
a
terrific
fact
but
it
is
the
sight
of
this
man
alone
that
can
recall
all
its
fearful
minutiae
to
my
mind
and
paint
to
my
imagination
in
the
most
vivid
colours
every
the
least
particular
connected
with
that
time
of
agony
these
periodical
visits
much
affect
me
for
months
i
dread
them
and
for
months
i
am
but
slowly
recovering
from
the
shocks
they
give
me
'but
once
more'
he
says--'but
once
more'
and
then
we
shall
not
meet
again
well
well
perchance
before
that
time
arrives
i
may
be
able
to
possess
myself
of
those
resources
which
will
enable
me
to
forestall
his
visit
and
so
at
least
free
myself
from
the
pang
of
expecting
him
he
paused
at
the
margin
of
the
wood
and
glanced
in
the
direction
of
bannerworth
hall
by
the
dim
light
which
yet
showed
from
out
the
light
sky
he
could
discern
the
ancient
gable
ends
and
turret-like
windows
he
could
see
the
well
laid
out
gardens
and
the
grove
of
stately
firs
that
shaded
it
from
the
northern
blasts
and
as
he
gazed
a
strong
emotion
seemed
to
come
over
him
such
as
no
one
could
have
supposed
would
for
one
moment
have
possessed
the
frame
of
one
so
apparently
unconnected
with
all
human
sympathies
i
know
this
spot
well
he
said
and
my
appearance
here
on
that
eventful
occasion
when
the
dread
of
my
approach
induced
a
crime
only
second
to
murder
itself
was
on
such
a
night
as
this
when
all
was
so
still
and
calm
around
and
when
he
who
at
the
merest
shadow
of
my
presence
rather
chose
to
rush
on
death
than
be
assured
it
was
myself
curses
on
the
circumstances
that
so
foiled
me
i
should
have
been
most
wealthy
i
should
have
possessed
the
means
of
commanding
the
adulation
of
those
who
now
hold
me
but
cheaply
but
still
the
time
may
come
i
have
a
hope
yet
and
that
greatness
which
i
have
ever
panted
for
that
magician-like
power
over
my
kind
which
the
possession
of
ample
means
alone
can
give
may
yet
be
mine
wrapping
his
cloak
more
closely
around
him
he
strode
forward
with
that
long
noiseless
step
which
was
peculiar
to
him
mechanically
he
appeared
to
avoid
those
obstacles
of
hedge
and
ditch
which
impeded
his
pathway
surely
he
had
come
that
road
often
or
he
would
not
so
easily
have
pursued
his
way
and
now
he
stood
by
the
edge
of
a
plantation
which
in
some
measure
protected
from
trespassers
the
more
private
gardens
of
the
hall
and
there
he
paused
as
if
a
feeling
of
irresolution
had
come
over
him
or
it
might
be
as
indeed
it
seemed
from
his
subsequent
conduct
that
he
had
come
without
any
fixed
intention
or
if
with
a
fixed
intention
without
any
regular
plan
of
carrying
it
into
effect
did
he
again
dream
of
intruding
into
any
of
the
chambers
of
that
mansion
with
the
ghastly
aspect
of
that
terrible
creation
with
which
in
the
minds
of
its
inhabitants
he
seemed
to
be
but
too
closely
identified
he
was
pale
attenuated
and
trembled
could
it
be
that
so
soon
it
had
become
necessary
to
renew
the
life-blood
in
his
veins
in
the
awful
manner
which
it
is
supposed
the
vampyre
brood
are
compelled
to
protract
their
miserable
existence
it
might
be
so
and
that
he
was
even
now
reflecting
upon
how
once
more
he
could
kindle
the
fire
of
madness
in
the
brain
of
that
beautiful
girl
who
he
had
already
made
so
irretrievably
wretched
he
leant
against
an
aged
tree
and
his
strange
lustrous-looking
eyes
seemed
to
collect
every
wandering
scintillation
of
light
that
was
around
and
to
shine
with
preternatural
intensity
i
must
i
will
he
said
be
master
of
bannerworth
hall
it
must
come
to
that
i
have
set
an
existence
upon
its
possession
and
i
will
have
it
and
then
if
with
my
own
hands
i
displace
it
brick
by
brick
and
stone
by
stone
i
will
discover
that
hidden
secret
which
no
one
but
myself
now
dreams
of
it
shall
be
done
by
force
or
fraud
by
love
or
by
despair
i
care
not
which
the
end
shall
sanctify
all
means
ay
even
if
i
wade
through
blood
to
my
desire
i
say
it
shall
be
done
there
was
a
holy
and
a
still
calmness
about
the
night
much
at
variance
with
the
storm
of
angry
passion
that
appeared
to
be
momentarily
gathering
power
in
the
breast
of
that
fearful
man
not
the
least
sound
came
from
bannerworth
hall
and
it
was
only
occasionally
that
from
afar
off
on
the
night
air
there
came
the
bark
of
some
watchdog
or
the
low
of
distant
cattle
all
else
was
mute
save
when
the
deep
sepulchral
tones
of
that
man
if
man
he
was
gave
an
impulse
to
the
soft
air
around
him
with
a
strolling
movement
as
if
he
were
careless
if
he
proceeded
in
that
direction
or
not
he
still
went
onward
toward
the
house
and
now
he
stood
by
that
little
summer-house
once
so
sweet
and
so
dear
a
retreat
in
which
the
heart-stricken
flora
had
held
her
interview
with
him
whom
she
loved
with
a
devotion
unknown
to
meaner
minds
this
spot
scarcely
commanded
any
view
of
the
house
for
so
enclosed
was
it
among
evergreens
and
blooming
flowers
that
it
seemed
like
a
very
wilderness
of
nature
upon
which
with
liberal
hand
she
had
showered
down
in
wild
luxuriance
her
wildest
floral
beauties
in
and
around
that
spot
the
night
air
was
loaded
with
sweets
the
mingled
perfume
of
many
flowers
made
that
place
seem
a
very
paradise
but
oh
how
sadly
at
variance
with
that
beauty
and
contentedness
of
nature
was
he
who
stood
amidst
such
beauty
all
incapable
as
he
was
of
appreciating
its
tenderness
or
of
gathering
the
faintest
moral
from
its
glory
why
am
i
here
he
said
here
without
fixed
design
or
stability
of
purpose
like
some
miser
who
has
hidden
his
own
hoards
so
deeply
within
the
bowels
of
the
earth
he
cannot
hope
that
he
shall
ever
again
be
able
to
bring
them
to
the
light
of
day
i
hover
around
this
spot
which
i
feel--which
i
know--contains
my
treasure
though
i
cannot
lay
my
hands
upon
it
or
exult
in
its
glistening
beauty
even
as
he
spoke
he
cowered
down
like
some
guilty
thing
for
he
heard
a
faint
footstep
upon
the
garden
path
so
light
so
fragile
was
the
step
that
in
the
light
of
day
the
very
hum
of
summer
insects
would
have
drowned
the
noise
but
he
heard
it
that
man
of
crime--of
unholy
and
awful
impulses
he
heard
it
and
he
shrunk
down
among
the
shrubs
and
flowers
till
he
was
hidden
completely
from
observation
amid
a
world
of
fragrant
essences
was
it
some
one
stealthily
in
that
place
even
as
he
was
unwelcome
or
unknown
or
was
it
one
who
had
observed
him
intrude
upon
the
privacy
of
those
now
unhappy
precincts
and
who
was
coming
to
deal
upon
him
that
death
which
vampyre
though
he
might
be
he
was
yet
susceptible
of
from
mortal
hands
the
footstep
advanced
and
lower
down
he
shrunk
until
his
coward-heart
beat
against
the
very
earth
itself
he
knew
that
he
was
unarmed
a
circumstance
rare
with
him
and
only
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
disturbance
of
his
mind
consequent
upon
the
visit
of
that
strange
man
to
his
house
whose
presence
had
awakened
so
many
conflicting
emotions
nearer
and
nearer
still
came
that
light
footstep
and
his
deep-seated
fears
would
not
let
him
perceive
that
it
was
not
the
step
of
caution
or
of
treachery
but
owed
its
lightness
to
the
natural
grace
and
freedom
of
movement
of
its
owner
the
moon
must
have
arisen
although
obscured
by
clouds
through
which
it
cast
but
a
dim
radiance
for
the
night
had
certainly
grown
lighter
so
that
although
there
were
no
strong
shadows
cast
a
more
diffused
brightness
was
about
all
things
and
their
outlines
looked
not
so
dancing
and
confused
the
one
with
the
other
he
strained
his
eyes
in
the
direction
whence
the
sounds
proceeded
and
then
his
fears
for
his
personal
safety
vanished
for
he
saw
it
was
a
female
form
that
was
slowly
advancing
towards
him
his
first
impulse
was
to
rise
for
with
the
transient
glimpse
he
got
of
it
he
knew
that
it
must
be
flora
bannerworth
but
a
second
thought
probably
one
of
intense
curiosity
to
know
what
could
possibly
have
brought
her
to
such
a
spot
at
such
a
time
restrained
him
and
he
was
quiet
but
if
the
surprise
of
sir
francis
varney
was
great
to
see
flora
bannerworth
at
such
a
time
in
such
a
place
we
have
no
doubt
that
with
the
knowledge
which
our
readers
have
of
her
their
astonishment
would
more
than
fully
equal
his
and
when
we
come
to
consider
that
since
that
eventful
period
when
the
sanctity
of
her
chamber
had
been
so
violated
by
that
fearful
midnight
visitant
it
must
appear
somewhat
strange
that
she
could
gather
courage
sufficient
to
wander
forth
alone
at
such
an
hour
had
she
no
dread
of
meeting
that
unearthly
being
did
the
possibility
that
she
might
fall
into
his
ruthless
grasp
not
come
across
her
mind
with
a
shuddering
consciousness
of
its
probability
had
she
no
reflection
that
each
step
she
took
was
taking
her
further
and
further
from
those
who
would
aid
her
in
all
extremities
it
would
seem
not
for
she
walked
onward
unheeding
and
apparently
unthinking
of
the
presence
possible
or
probable
of
that
bane
of
her
existence
but
let
us
look
at
her
again
how
strange
and
spectral-like
she
moves
along
there
seems
no
speculation
in
her
countenance
but
with
a
strange
and
gliding
step
she
walks
like
some
dim
shadow
of
the
past
in
that
ancient
garden
she
is
very
pale
and
on
her
brow
there
is
the
stamp
of
suffering
her
dress
is
a
morning
robe
she
holds
it
lightly
round
her
and
thus
she
moves
forward
towards
that
summer-house
which
probably
to
her
was
sanctified
by
having
witnessed
those
vows
of
pure
affection
which
came
from
the
lips
of
charles
holland
about
whose
fate
there
now
hung
so
great
a
mystery
has
madness
really
seized
upon
the
brain
of
that
beautiful
girl
has
the
strong
intellect
really
sunk
beneath
the
oppressions
to
which
it
has
been
subjected
does
she
now
walk
forth
with
a
disordered
intellect
the
queen
of
some
fantastic
realm
viewing
the
material
world
with
eyes
that
are
not
of
earth
shunning
perhaps
that
which
she
should
have
sought
and
perchance
in
her
frenzy
seeking
that
which
in
a
happier
frame
of
mind
she
would
have
shunned
illustration
such
might
have
been
the
impression
of
any
one
who
had
looked
upon
her
for
a
moment
and
who
knew
the
disastrous
scenes
through
which
she
had
so
recently
passed
but
we
can
spare
our
readers
the
pangs
of
such
a
supposition
we
have
bespoken
their
love
for
flora
bannerworth
and
we
are
certain
that
she
has
it
therefore
would
we
spare
them
even
for
a
few
brief
moments
from
imagining
that
cruel
destiny
had
done
its
worst
and
that
the
fine
and
beautiful
spirit
we
have
so
much
commended
had
lost
its
power
of
rational
reflection
no
thank
heaven
such
is
not
the
case
flora
bannerworth
is
not
mad
but
under
the
strong
influence
of
some
eccentric
dream
which
has
pictured
to
her
mind
images
which
have
no
home
but
in
the
airy
realms
of
imagination
she
has
wandered
forth
from
her
chamber
to
that
sacred
spot
where
she
had
met
him
she
loved
and
heard
the
noblest
declaration
of
truth
and
constancy
that
ever
flowed
from
human
lips
yes
she
is
sleeping
but
with
a
precision
such
as
the
somnambulist
so
strangely
exerts
she
trod
the
well-known
paths
slowly
but
surely
toward
that
summer's
bower
where
her
dreams
had
not
told
her
lay
crouching
that
most
hideous
spectre
of
her
imagination
sir
francis
varney
he
who
stood
between
her
and
her
heart's
best
joy
he
who
had
destroyed
all
hope
of
happiness
and
who
had
converted
her
dearest
affections
into
only
so
many
causes
of
greater
disquietude
than
the
blessings
they
should
have
been
to
her
oh
could
she
have
imagined
but
for
one
moment
that
he
was
there
with
what
an
eagerness
of
terror
would
she
have
flown
back
again
to
the
shelter
of
those
walls
where
at
least
was
to
be
found
some
protection
from
the
fearful
vampyre's
embrace
and
where
she
would
be
within
hail
of
friendly
hearts
who
would
stand
boldly
between
her
and
every
thought
of
harm
but
she
knew
it
not
and
onwards
she
went
until
the
very
hem
of
her
garment
touched
the
face
of
sir
francis
varney
and
he
was
terrified--he
dared
not
move--he
dared
not
speak
the
idea
that
she
had
died
and
that
this
was
her
spirit
come
to
wreak
some
terrible
vengeance
upon
him
for
a
time
possessed
him
and
so
paralysed
with
fear
was
he
that
he
could
neither
move
nor
speak
it
had
been
well
if
during
that
trance
of
indecision
in
which
his
coward
heart
placed
him
flora
had
left
the
place
and
again
sought
her
home
but
unhappily
such
an
impulse
came
not
over
her
she
sat
upon
that
rustic
seat
where
she
had
reposed
when
charles
had
clasped
her
to
his
heart
and
through
her
very
dream
the
remembrance
of
that
pure
affection
came
across
her
and
in
the
tenderest
and
most
melodious
accents
she
said--
charles
charles
and
do
you
love
me
still
no--no
you
have
not
forsaken
me
save
me
save
me
from
the
vampyre
she
shuddered
and
sir
francis
varney
heard
her
weeping
fool
that
i
am
he
muttered
to
be
so
terrified
she
sleeps
this
is
one
of
the
phases
which
a
disordered
imagination
oft
puts
on
she
sleeps
and
perchance
this
may
be
an
opportunity
of
further
increasing
the
dread
of
my
visitation
which
shall
make
bannerworth
hall
far
too
terrible
a
dwelling-place
for
her
and
well
i
know
if
she
goes
they
will
all
go
it
will
become
a
deserted
house
and
that
is
what
i
want
a
house
too
with
such
an
evil
reputation
that
none
but
myself
who
have
created
that
reputation
will
venture
within
its
walls--a
house
which
superstition
will
point
out
as
the
abode
of
evil
spirits--a
house
as
it
were
by
general
opinion
ceded
to
the
vampyre
yes
it
shall
be
my
own
fit
dwelling-place
for
a
while
for
me
i
have
sworn
it
shall
be
mine
and
i
will
keep
my
oath
little
such
as
i
have
to
do
with
vows
he
rose
and
moved
slowly
to
the
narrow
entrance
of
the
summer-house
a
movement
he
could
make
without
at
all
disturbing
flora
for
the
rustic
seat
on
which
she
sat
was
at
its
further
extremity
and
there
he
stood
the
upper
part
of
his
gaunt
and
hideous
form
clearly
defined
upon
the
now
much
lighter
sky
so
that
if
flora
bannerworth
had
not
been
in
that
trance
of
sleep
in
which
she
really
was
one
glance
upward
would
let
her
see
the
hideous
companion
she
had
in
that
once
much-loved
spot--a
spot
hitherto
sacred
to
the
best
and
noblest
feelings
but
now
doomed
for
ever
to
be
associated
with
that
terrific
spectre
of
despair
but
she
was
in
no
state
to
see
so
terrible
a
sight
her
hands
were
over
her
face
and
she
was
weeping
still
surely
he
loves
me
she
whispered
he
has
said
he
loved
me
and
he
does
not
speak
in
vain
he
loves
me
still
and
i
shall
again
look
upon
his
face
a
heaven
to
me
charles
charles
you
will
come
again
surely
they
sin
against
the
divinity
of
love
who
would
tell
me
that
you
love
me
not
ha
muttered
varney
this
passion
is
her
first
and
takes
a
strong
hold
on
her
young
heart--she
loves
him--but
what
are
human
affections
to
me
i
have
no
right
to
count
myself
in
the
great
muster-roll
of
humanity
i
look
not
like
an
inhabitant
of
the
earth
and
yet
am
on
it
i
love
no
one
expect
no
love
from
any
one
but
i
will
make
humanity
a
slave
to
me
and
the
lip-service
of
them
who
hate
me
in
their
hearts
shall
be
as
pleasant
jingling
music
to
my
ear
as
if
it
were
quite
sincere
i
will
speak
to
this
girl
she
is
not
mad--perchance
she
may
be
there
was
a
diabolical
look
of
concentrated
hatred
upon
varney's
face
as
he
now
advanced
two
paces
towards
the
beautiful
flora
the
threat--its
consequences--the
rescue
and
sir
francis
varney's
danger
illustration
sir
francis
varney
now
paused
again
and
he
seemed
for
a
few
moments
to
gloat
over
the
helpless
condition
of
her
whom
he
had
so
determined
to
make
his
victim
there
was
no
look
of
pity
in
his
face
no
one
touch
of
human
kindness
could
be
found
in
the
whole
expression
of
those
diabolical
features
and
if
he
delayed
making
the
attempt
to
strike
terror
into
the
heart
of
that
unhappy
but
beautiful
being
it
could
not
be
from
any
relenting
feeling
but
simply
that
he
wished
for
a
few
moments
to
indulge
his
imagination
with
the
idea
of
perfecting
his
villany
more
effectually
alas
and
they
who
would
have
flown
to
her
rescue--they
who
for
her
would
have
chanced
all
accidents
ay
even
life
itself
were
sleeping
and
knew
not
of
the
loved
one's
danger
she
was
alone
and
far
enough
from
the
house
to
be
driven
to
that
tottering
verge
where
sanity
ends
and
the
dream
of
madness
with
all
its
terrors
commences
but
still
she
slept--if
that
half-waking
sleep
could
indeed
be
considered
as
any
thing
akin
to
ordinary
slumber--still
she
slept
and
called
mournfully
upon
her
lover's
name
and
in
tender
beseeching
accents
that
should
have
melted
even
the
stubbornest
hearts
did
she
express
her
soul's
conviction
that
he
loved
her
still
the
very
repetition
of
the
name
of
charles
holland
seemed
to
be
galling
to
sir
francis
varney
he
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
as
she
again
uttered
it
and
then
stepping
forward
he
stood
within
a
pace
of
where
she
sat
and
in
a
fearfully
distinct
voice
he
said--
flora
bannerworth
awake
awake
and
look
upon
me
although
the
sight
blast
and
drive
you
to
despair
awake
awake
it
was
not
the
sound
of
the
voice
which
aroused
her
from
that
strange
slumber
it
is
said
that
those
who
sleep
in
that
eccentric
manner
are
insensible
to
sounds
but
that
the
lightest
touch
will
arouse
them
in
an
instant
and
so
it
was
in
this
case
for
sir
francis
varney
as
he
spoke
laid
upon
the
hand
of
flora
two
of
his
cold
corpse-like
looking
fingers
a
shriek
burst
from
her
lips
and
although
the
confusion
of
her
memory
and
conceptions
was
immense
yet
she
was
awake
and
the
somnambulistic
trance
had
left
her
help
help
she
cried
gracious
heavens
where
am
i
varney
spoke
not
but
he
spread
out
his
long
thin
arms
in
such
a
manner
that
he
seemed
almost
to
encircle
her
while
he
touched
her
not
so
that
escape
became
a
matter
of
impossibility
and
to
attempt
to
do
so
must
have
been
to
have
thrown
herself
into
his
hideous
embrace
she
could
obtain
but
a
single
view
of
the
face
and
figure
of
him
who
opposed
her
progress
but
slight
as
that
view
was
it
more
than
sufficed
the
very
extremity
of
fear
came
across
her
and
she
sat
like
one
paralysed
the
only
evidence
of
existence
she
gave
consisting
in
the
words--
the
vampyre--the
vampyre
yes
said
varney
the
vampyre
you
know
me
flora
bannerworth--varney
the
vampyre
your
midnight
guest
at
that
feast
of
blood
i
am
the
vampyre
look
upon
me
well
shrink
not
from
my
gaze
you
will
do
well
not
to
shun
me
but
to
speak
to
me
in
such
a
shape
that
i
may
learn
to
love
you
flora
shook
as
in
a
convulsion
and
she
looked
as
white
as
any
marble
statue
this
is
horrible
she
said
why
does
not
heaven
grant
me
the
death
i
pray
for
hold
said
varney
dress
not
up
in
the
false
colours
of
the
imagination
that
which
in
itself
is
sufficiently
terrific
to
need
none
of
the
allurements
of
romance
flora
bannerworth
you
are
persecuted--persecuted
by
me
the
vampyre
it
is
my
fate
to
persecute
you
for
there
are
laws
to
the
invisible
as
well
as
the
visible
creation
that
force
even
such
a
being
as
i
am
to
play
my
part
in
the
great
drama
of
existence
i
am
a
vampyre
the
sustenance
that
supports
this
frame
must
be
drawn
from
the
life-blood
of
others
oh
horror--horror
but
most
i
do
affect
the
young
and
beautiful
it
is
from
the
veins
of
such
as
thou
art
flora
bannerworth
that
i
would
seek
the
sustenance
i'm
compelled
to
obtain
for
my
own
exhausted
energies
but
never
yet
in
all
my
long
career--a
career
extending
over
centuries
of
time--never
yet
have
i
felt
the
soft
sensation
of
human
pity
till
i
looked
on
thee
exquisite
piece
of
excellence
even
at
the
moment
when
the
reviving
fluid
from
the
gushing
fountain
of
your
veins
was
warming
at
my
heart
i
pitied
and
i
loved
you
oh
flora
even
i
can
now
feel
the
pang
of
being
what
i
am
there
was
a
something
in
the
tone
a
touch
of
sadness
in
the
manner
and
a
deep
sincerity
in
these
words
that
in
some
measure
disabused
flora
of
her
fears
she
sobbed
hysterically
and
a
gush
of
tears
came
to
her
relief
as
in
almost
inarticulate
accents
she
said--
may
the
great
god
forgive
even
you
i
have
need
of
such
a
prayer
exclaimed
varney--heaven
knows
i
have
need
of
such
a
prayer
may
it
ascend
on
the
wings
of
the
night
air
to
the
throne
of
heaven
may
it
be
softly
whispered
by
ministering
angels
to
the
ear
of
divinity
god
knows
i
have
need
of
such
a
prayer
to
hear
you
speak
in
such
a
strain
said
flora
calms
the
excited
fancy
and
strips
even
your
horrible
presence
of
some
of
its
maddening
influence
hush
said
the
vampire
you
must
hear
more--you
must
know
more
ere
you
speak
of
the
matters
that
have
of
late
exercised
an
influence
of
terror
over
you
but
how
came
i
here
said
flora
tell
me
that
by
what
more
than
earthly
power
have
you
brought
me
to
this
spot
if
i
am
to
listen
to
you
why
should
it
not
be
at
some
more
likely
time
and
place
i
have
powers
said
varney
assuming
from
flora's
words
that
she
would
believe
such
arrogance--i
have
powers
which
suffice
to
bend
many
purposes
to
my
will--powers
incidental
to
my
position
and
therefore
is
it
i
have
brought
you
here
to
listen
to
that
which
should
make
you
happier
than
you
are
i
will
attend
said
flora
i
do
not
shudder
now
there's
an
icy
coldness
through
my
veins
but
it
is
the
night
air--speak
i
will
attend
you
i
will
flora
bannerworth
i
am
one
who
has
witnessed
time's
mutations
on
man
and
on
his
works
and
i
have
pitied
neither
i
have
seen
the
fall
of
empires
and
sighed
not
that
high
reaching
ambition
was
toppled
to
the
dust
i
have
seen
the
grave
close
over
the
young
and
the
beautiful--those
whom
i
have
doomed
by
my
insatiable
thirst
for
human
blood
to
death
long
ere
the
usual
span
of
life
was
past
but
i
never
loved
till
now
can
such
a
being
as
you
said
flora
be
susceptible
of
such
an
earthly
passion
and
wherefore
not
love
is
either
too
much
of
heaven
or
too
much
of
earth
to
find
a
home
with
thee
no
flora
no
it
may
be
that
the
feeling
is
born
of
pity
i
will
save
you--i
will
save
you
from
a
continuance
of
the
horrors
that
are
assailing
you
oh
then
may
heaven
have
mercy
in
your
hour
of
need
amen
may
you
even
yet
know
peace
and
joy
above
it
is
a
faint
and
straggling
hope--but
if
achieved
it
will
be
through
the
interposition
of
such
a
spirit
as
thine
flora
which
has
already
exercised
so
benign
an
influence
upon
my
tortured
soul
as
to
produce
the
wish
within
my
heart
to
do
a

one
unselfish
action
that
wish

father
to

for
thy

will
believe
so
much
flora

it
is
a
condition
with
my
hateful
race
that
if
we
can
find

we
are
free

you
will

a
cloud
swept
from
off
the
face
of

moon
and
a
slant
ray
fell
upon
the
hideous
features
of
the
vampire
he
looked
as
if
just
rescued
from
some
charnel-house
and
endowed
for
a
space
with
vitality
to
destroy
all

judgment

unjust
you

feel
that

most
gratuitously--a
sufferer
while
there
existed
no

cause
that
i
should
suffer
one
who
has
been
tortured
not
from
personal

of

to

some

flora
looked
intently
at
him
and
listened
while
with
a
serious
earnestness
of
manner
he
detailed
to
her
something
of
the
physiology
of
the
singular
class
of
beings
which
the
concurrence
of
all
circumstances
tended
to
make
him
appear

he
said
it
is
not
that
i
am
so
enamoured
of
an
existence
to
be
prolonged
only
by
such
frightful
means
which
induces
me
to
become
a
terror

you
or
to
others
believe
me
that
if
my
victims
those
whom
my
insatiable
thirst
for
blood
make
wretched
suffer
much
i
the
vampyre
am
not
without
my
moments
of
unutterable
agony
but
it
is
a
mysterious
law
of
our
nature
that
as
the
period
approaches
when
the
exhausted
energies
of
life
require
a
new
support
from
the
warm
gushing
fountain
of
another's
veins
the
strong
desire
to
live
grows
upon
us
until
in
a
paroxysm
of
wild
insanity
which
will
recognise
no
obstacles
human
or
divine
we
seek
a
victim
a
fearful
state
said
flora
it
is
so
and
when
the
dreadful
repast
is
over
then
again
the
pulse
beats
healthfully
and
the
wasted
energies
of
a
strange
kind
of
vitality
are
restored
to
us
we
become
calm
again
but
with
that
calmness
comes
all
the
horror
all
the
agony
of
reflection
and
we
suffer
far
more
than
tongue
can
tell
you
have
my
pity
said
flora
even
you
have
my
pity
i
might
well
demand
it
if
such
a
feeling
held
a
place
within
your
breast
i
might
well
demand
your
pity

never
crawled
an
abject
wretch
upon
the
earth's
rotundity
so
pitiable
as
i
go
on
go
on
i
will
and
with
such
brief
conclusions
as
i
may
having
once
attacked
any
human
being
we
feel
a
strange
but
terribly
impulsive
desire
again
to
seek

person
for
more
blood
but
i
love
you
flora
the
small
amount
of

would
fain
save
you
oh
tell
me
how
i
may
escape
the
terrible
infliction
that
can
only
be
done
by
flight
leave
this
place
i
implore
you
leave
it
as
quickly
as
the
movement
may
be
made
linger
not--cast
not
one
regretful
look
behind
you
on
your
ancient
home
i
shall
remain
in
this
locality
for
years
let
me
lose
sight
of
you
i
will
not
pursue
you
but
by
force
of
circumstances
i
am
myself
compelled
to
linger
here
flight
is
the
only
means
by
which
you
may
avoid
a
doom
as
terrific
as
that
which
i
endure
but
tell
me
said
flora
after
a
moment's
pause
during
which
she
appeared
to
be
endeavouring
to
gather
courage
to
ask
some
fearful
question
tell
me
if
it
be
true
that
those
who
have
once
endured
the
terrific
attack
of
a
vampyre
become
themselves
after
death
one
of
that
dread
race
it
is
by
such
means
said
varney
that
the
frightful
brood
increases
but
time
and
circumstances
must
aid
the
development
of
the
new
and
horrible
existence
you
however
are
safe
safe
oh
say
that
word
again
yes
safe
not
once
or
twice
will
the
vampyre's
attack
have
sufficient
influence
on
your
mortal
frame

to
induce
a
susceptibility
on
your
part
to
become
coexistent
with
such
as
he
the
attacks
must
be
often
repeated
and
the
termination
of
mortal
existence
must
be
a
consequence
essential
and
direct
from
those
attacks
before
such
a
result
may
be
anticipated
yes
yes
i
understand
if
you
were
to
continue
my
victim
from
year
to
year
the
energies
of
life
would
slowly
waste
away
and
till
like
some
faint
taper's
gleam
consuming
more
sustenance
than
it
received
the
veriest
accident
would
extinguish
your
existence
and
then
flora
bannerworth
you
might
become
a
vampyre
oh
horrible
most
horrible
if
by
chance
or
by
design
the
least
glimpse
of
the
cold
moonbeams
rested
on
your
apparently
lifeless
remains
you
would
rise
again
and
be
one
of
us--a
terror
to
yourself
and
a
desolation
to
all
around
oh
i
will
fly
from
here
said
flora
the
hope
of
escape
from
so
terrific
and
dreadful
a
doom
shall
urge
me
onward
if
flight
can
save
me--flight
from
bannerworth
hall
i
will
pause
not
until
continents
and
oceans
divide
us
it
is
well
i'm
able
now
thus
calmly
to
reason
with
you
a
few
short
months
more
and
i
shall
feel
the
languor
of
death
creeping
over
me
and
then
will
come
that
mad
excitement
of
the
brain
which
were
you
hidden
behind
triple
doors
of
steel
would
tempt
me
again
to
seek
your
chamber--again
to
seize
you
in
my
full
embrace--again
to
draw
from
your
veins
the
means
of
prolonged
life--again
to
convulse
your
very
soul
with
terror
i
need
no
incentives
said
flora
with
a
shudder
in
the
shape
of
descriptions
of
the
past
to
urge
me
on
you
will
fly
from
bannerworth
hall
yes
yes
said
flora
it
shall
be
so
its
very
chambers
now
are
hideous
with
the
recollection
of
scenes
enacted
in
them
i
will
urge
my
brothers
my
mother
all
to
leave
and
in
some
distant
clime
we
will
find
security
and
shelter
there
even
we
will
learn
to
think
of
you
with
more
of
sorrow
than
of
anger--more
pity
than
reproach--more
curiosity
than
loathing
be
it
so
said
the
vampyre
and
he
clasped
his
hands
as
if
with
a
thankfulness
that
he
had
done
so
much
towards
restoring
peace
at
least
to
one
who
in
consequence
of
his
acts
had
felt
such
exquisite
despair
be
it
so
and
even
i
will
hope
that
the
feelings
which
have
induced
so
desolated
and
so
isolated
a
being
as
myself
to
endeavour
to
bring
peace
to
one
human
heart
will
plead
for
me
trumpet-tongued
to
heaven
it
will--it
will
said
flora
do
you
think
so
i
do
and
i
will
pray
that
the
thought
may
turn
to
certainty
in
such
a
cause
the
vampyre
appeared
to
be
much
affected
and
then
he
added--
flora
you
know
that
this
spot
has
been
the
scene
of
a
catastrophe
fearful
to
look
back
upon
in
the
annals
of
your
family
it
has
said
flora
i
know
to
what
you
allude
'tis
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
to
all--a
sad
theme
to
me
and
one
i
would
not
court
nor
would
i
oppress
you
with
it
your
father
here
on
this
very
spot
committed
that
desperate
act
which
brought
him
uncalled
for
to
the
judgment
seat
of
god
i
have
a
strange
wild
curiosity
upon
such
subjects
will
you
in
return
for
the
good
that
i
have
tried
to
do
you
gratify
it
i
know
not
what
you
mean
said
flora
to
be
more
explicit
then
do
you
remember
the
day
on
which
your
father
breathed
his
last
too
well--too
well
did
you
see
him
or
converse
with
him
shortly
before
that
desperate
act
was
committed
no
he
shut
himself
up
for
some
time
in
a
solitary
chamber
ha
what
chamber
the
one
in
which
i
slept
myself
on
the
night--
yes
yes
the
one
with
the
portrait--that
speaking
portrait--the
eyes
of
which
seem
to
challenge
an
intruder
as
he
enters
the
apartment
the
same
for
hours
shut
up
there
added
varney
musingly
and
from
thence
he
wandered
to
the
garden
where
in
this
summer-house
he
breathed
his
last
it
was
so
then
flora
ere
i
bid
you
adieu--
these
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
there
was
a
quick
hasty
footstep
and
henry
bannerworth
appeared
behind
varney
in
the
very
entrance
of
the
summer-house
now
he
cried
for
revenge
now
foul
being
blot
upon
the
earth's
surface
horrible
imitation
of
humanity
if
mortal
arm
can
do
aught
against
you
you
shall
die
a
shriek
came
from
the
lips
of
flora
and
flinging
herself
past
varney
who
stepped
aside
she
clung
to
her
brother
who
made
an
unavailing
pass
with
his
sword
at
the
vampyre
it
was
a
critical
moment
and
had
the
presence
of
mind
of
varney
deserted
him
in
the
least
unarmed
as
he
was
he
must
have
fallen
beneath
the
weapon
of
henry
to
spring
however
up
the
seat
which
flora
had
vacated
and
to
dash
out
some
of
the
flimsy
and
rotten
wood-work
at
the
back
of
the
summer-house
by
the
propulsive
power
of
his
whole
frame
was
the
work
of
a
moment
and
before
henry
could
free
himself
from
the
clinging
embrace
of
flora
varney
the
vampyre
was
gone
and
there
was
no
greater
chance
of
his
capture
than
on
a
former
occasion
when
he
was
pursued
in
vain
from
the
hall
to
the
wood
in
the
intricacies
of
which
he
was
so
entirely
lost
the
explanation--marchdale's
advice--the
projected
removal
and
the
admiral's
anger
illustration
this
extremely
sudden
movement
on
the
part
of
varney
was
certainly
as
unexpected
as
it
was
decisive
henry
had
imagined
that
by
taking
possession
of
the
only
entrance
to
the
summer-house
he
must
come
into
personal
conflict
with
the
being
who
had
worked
so
much
evil
for
him
and
his
and
that
he
should
so
suddenly
have
created
for
himself
another
mode
of
exit
certainly
never
occurred
to
him
for
heaven's
sake
flora
he
said
unhand
me
this
is
a
time
for
action
but
henry
henry
hear
me
presently
presently
dear
flora
i
will
yet
make
another
effort
to
arrest
the
headlong
flight
of
varney
he
shook
her
off
perhaps
with
not
more
roughness
than
was
necessary
to
induce
her
to
forego
her
grasp
of
him
but
in
a
manner
that
fully
showed
he
intended
to
be
free
and
then
he
sprang
through
the
same
aperture
whence
varney
had
disappeared
just
as
george
and
mr
marchdale
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
summer-house
it
was
nearly
morning
so
that
the
fields
were
brightening
up
with
the
faint
radiance
of
the
coming
day
and
when
henry
reached
a
point
which
he
knew
commanded
an
extensive
view
he
paused
and
ran
his
eye
eagerly
along
the
landscape
with
a
hope
of
discovering
some
trace
of
the
fugitive
such
however
was
not
the
case
he
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
of
sir
francis
varney
and
then
he
turned
and
called
loudly
to
george
to
join
him
and
was
immediately
replied
to
by
his
brother's
presence
accompanied
by
marchdale
before
however
they
could
exchange
a
word
a
rattling
discharge
of
fire-arms
took
place
from
one
of
the
windows
and
they
heard
the
admiral
in
a
loud
voice
shouting--
broadside
to
broadside
give
it
them
again
jack
hit
them
between
wind
and
water
then
there
was
another
rattling
discharge
and
henry
exclaimed--
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
firing
it
comes
from
the
admiral's
room
said
marchdale
on
my
life
i
think
the
old
man
must
be
mad
he
has
some
six
or
eight
pistols
ranged
in
a
row
along
the
window-sill
and
all
loaded
so
that
by
the
aid
of
a
match
they
can
be
pretty
well
discharged
as
a
volley
which
he
considers
the
only
proper
means
of
firing
upon
the
vampyre
it
is
so
replied
george
and
no
doubt
hearing
an
alarm
he
has
commenced
operations
by
firing
into
the
enemy
well
well
said
henry
he
must
have
his
way
i
have
pursued
varney
thus
far
and
that
he
has
again
retreated
to
the
wood
i
cannot
doubt
between
this
and
the
full
light
of
day
let
us
at
least
make
an
effort
to
discover
his
place
of
retreat
we
know
the
locality
as
well
as
he
can
possibly
and
i
propose
now
that
we
commence
an
active
search
come
on
then
said
marchdale
we
are
all
armed
and
i
for
one
shall
feel
no
hesitation
in
taking
the
life
if
it
be
possible
to
do
so
of
that
strange
being
of
that
possibility
you
doubt
said
george
as
they
hurried
on
across
the
meadows
indeed
i
do
and
with
reason
too
i'm
certain
that
when
i
fired
at
him
before
i
hit
him
and
besides
flora
must
have
shot
him
upon
the
occasion
when
we
were
absent
and
she
used
your
pistols
henry
to
defend
herself
and
her
mother
it
would
seem
so
said
henry
and
disregarding
all
present
circumstances
if
i
do
meet
him
i
will
put
to
the
proof
whether
he
be
mortal
or
not
the
distance
was
not
great
and
they
soon
reached
the
margin
of
the
wood
they
then
separated
agreeing
to
meet
within
it
at
a
well-spring
familiar
to
them
all
previous
to
which
each
was
to
make
his
best
endeavour
to
discover
if
any
one
was
hidden
among
the
bush-wood
or
in
the
hollows
of
the
ancient
trees
they
should
encounter
on
their
line
of
march
the
fact
was
that
henry
finding
that
he
was
likely
to
pass
an
exceedingly
disturbed
restless
night
through
agitation
of
spirits
had
after
tossing
to
and
fro
on
his
couch
for
many
hours
wisely
at
length
risen
and
determined
to
walk
abroad
in
the
gardens
belonging
to
the
mansion
in
preference
to
continuing
in
such
a
state
of
fever
and
anxiety
as
he
was
in
in
his
own
chamber
since
the
vampyre's
dreadful
visit
it
had
been
the
custom
of
both
the
brothers
occasionally
to
tap
at
the
chamber
door
of
flora
who
at
her
own
request
now
that
she
had
changed
her
room
and
dispensed
with
any
one
sitting
up
with
her
wished
occasionally
to
be
communicated
with
by
some
member
of
the
family
henry
then
after
rapidly
dressing
as
he
passed
the
door
of
her
bedroom
was
about
to
tap
at
it
when
to
his
surprise
he
found
it
open
and
upon
hastily
entering
it
he
observed
that
the
bed
was
empty
and
a
hasty
glance
round
the
apartment
convinced
him
that
flora
was
not
there
alarm
took
possession
of
him
and
hastily
arming
himself
he
roused
marchdale
and
george
but
without
waiting
for
them
to
be
ready
to
accompany
him
he
sought
the
garden
to
search
it
thoroughly
in
case
she
should
be
anywhere
there
concealed
thus
it
was
he
had
come
upon
the
conference
so
strangely
and
so
unexpectedly
held
between
varney
and
flora
in
the
summer-house
with
what
occurred
upon
that
discovery
the
readers
are
acquainted
flora
had
promised
george
that
she
would
return
immediately
to
the
house
but
when
in
compliance
with
the
call
of
henry
george
and
marchdale
had
left
her
alone
she
felt
so
agitated
and
faint
that
she
began
to
cling
to
the
trellis
work
of
the
little
building
for
a
few
moments
before
she
could
gather
strength
to
reach
the
mansion
two
or
three
minutes
might
thus
have
elapsed
and
flora
was
in
such
a
state
of
mental
bewilderment
with
all
that
had
occurred
that
she
could
scarce
believe
it
real
when
suddenly
a
slight
sound
attracted
her
attention
and
through
the
gap
which
had
been
made
in
the
wall
of
the
summer-house
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
composure
again
appeared
sir
francis
varney
flora
he
said
quietly
resuming
the
discourse
which
had
been
broken
off
i
am
quite
convinced
now
that
you
will
be
much
the
happier
for
the
interview
gracious
heaven
said
flora
whence
have
you
come
from
i
have
never
left
said
varney
but
i
saw
you
fly
from
this
spot
you
did
but
it
was
only
to
another
immediately
outside
the
summer
house
i
had
no
idea
of
breaking
off
our
conference
so
abruptly
have
you
anything
to
add
to
what
you
have
already
stated
absolutely
nothing
unless
you
have
a
question
to
propose
to
me--i
should
have
thought
you
had
flora
is
there
no
other
circumstance
weighing
heavily
upon
your
mind
as
well
as
the
dreadful
visitation
i
have
subjected
you
to
yes
said
flora
what
has
become
of
charles
holland
listen
do
not
discard
all
hope
when
you
are
far
from
here
you
will
meet
with
him
again
but
he
has
left
me
and
yet
he
will
be
able
when
you
again
encounter
him
so
far
to
extenuate
his
seeming
perfidy
that
you
shall
hold
him
as
untouched
in
honour
as
when
first
he
whispered
to
you
that
he
loved
you
oh
joy
joy
said
flora
by
that
assurance
you
have
robbed
misfortune
of
its
sting
and
richly
compensated
me
for
all
that
i
have
suffered
adieu
said
the
vampyre
i
shall
now
proceed
to
my
own
home
by
a
different
route
to
that
taken
by
those
who
would
kill
me
but
after
this
said
flora
there
shall
be
no
danger
you
shall
be
held
harmless
and
our
departure
from
bannerworth
hall
shall
be
so
quick
that
you
will
soon
be
released
from
all
apprehension
of
vengeance
from
my
brother
and
i
shall
taste
again
of
that
happiness
which
i
thought
had
fled
from
me
for
ever
farewell
said
the
vampire
and
folding
his
cloak
closely
around
him
he
strode
from
the
summer-house
soon
disappearing
from
her
sight
behind
the
shrubs
and
ample
vegetation
with
which
that
garden
abounded
flora
sunk
upon
her
knees
and
uttered
a
brief
but
heartfelt
thanksgiving
to
heaven
for
this
happy
change
in
her
destiny
the
hue
of
health
faintly
again
visited
her
cheeks
and
as
she
now
with
a
feeling
of
more
energy
and
strength
than
she
had
been
capable
of
exerting
for
many
days
walked
towards
the
house
she
felt
all
that
delightful
sensation
which
the
mind
experiences
when
it
is
shaking
off
the
trammels
of
some
serious
evil
which
it
delights
now
to
find
that
the
imagination
has
attired
in
far
worse
colours
than
the
facts
deserved
it
is
scarcely
necessary
after
this
to
say
that
the
search
in
the
wood
for
sir
francis
varney
was
an
unproductive
one
and
that
the
morning
dawned
upon
the
labours
of
the
brother
and
of
mr
marchdale
without
their
having
discovered
the
least
indication
of
the
presence
of
varney
again
puzzled
and
confounded
they
stood
on
the
margin
of
the
wood
and
looked
sadly
towards
the
brightening
windows
of
bannerworth
hall
which
were
now
reflecting
with
a
golden
radiance
the
slant
rays
of
the
morning
sun
foiled
again
remarked
henry
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
foiled
again
and
as
completely
as
before
i
declare
that
i
will
fight
this
man
let
our
friend
the
admiral
say
what
he
will
against
such
a
measure
i
will
meet
him
in
mortal
combat
he
shall
consummate
his
triumph
over
our
whole
family
by
my
death
or
i
will
rid
the
world
and
ourselves
of
so
frightful
a
character
let
us
hope
said
marchdale
that
some
other
course
may
be
adopted
which
shall
put
an
end
to
these
proceedings
that
exclaimed
henry
is
to
hope
against
all
probability
what
other
course
can
be
pursued
be
this
varney
man
or
devil
he
has
evidently
marked
us
for
his
prey
illustration
indeed
it
would
seem
so
remarked
george
but
yet
he
shall
find
that
we
will
not
fall
so
easily
he
shall
discover
that
if
poor
flora's
gentle
spirit
has
been
crushed
by
these
frightful
circumstances
we
are
of
a
sterner
mould
he
shall
said
henry
i
for
one
will
dedicate
my
life
to
this
matter
i
will
know
no
more
rest
than
is
necessary
to
recruit
my
frame
until
i
have
succeeded
in
overcoming
this
monster
i
will
seek
no
pleasure
here
and
will
banish
from
my
mind
all
else
that
may
interfere
with
that
one
fixed
pursuit
he
or
i
must
fall
well
spoken
said
marchdale
and
yet
i
hope
that
circumstances
may
occur
to
prevent
such
a
necessity
of
action
and
that
probably
you
will
yet
see
that
it
will
be
wise
and
prudent
to
adopt
a
milder
and
a
safer
course
no
marchdale
you
cannot
feel
as
we
feel
you
look
on
more
as
a
spectator
sympathising
with
the
afflictions
of
either
than
feeling
the
full
sting
of
those
afflictions
yourself
do
i
not
feel
acutely
for
you
i'm
a
lonely
man
in
the
world
and
i
have
taught
myself
now
to
centre
my
affections
in
your
family
my
recollections
of
early
years
assist
me
in
so
doing
believe
me
both
of
you
that
i
am
no
idle
spectator
of
your
griefs
but
that
i
share
them
fully
if
i
advise
you
to
be
peaceful
and
to
endeavour
by
the
gentlest
means
possible
to
accomplish
your
aims
it
is
not
that
i
would
counsel
you
cowardice
but
having
seen
so
much
more
of
the
world
than
either
of
you
have
had
time
or
opportunity
of
seeing
i
do
not
look
so
enthusiastically
upon
matters
but
with
a
cooler
calmer
judgment
i
do
not
say
a
better
i
proffer
to
you
my
counsel
we
thank
you
said
henry
but
this
is
a
matter
in
which
action
seems
specially
called
for
it
is
not
to
be
borne
that
a
whole
family
is
to
be
oppressed
by
such
a
fiend
in
human
shape
as
that
varney
let
me
said
marchdale
counsel
you
to
submit
to
flora's
decision
in
this
business
let
her
wishes
constitute
the
rules
of
action
she
is
the
greatest
sufferer
and
the
one
most
deeply
interested
in
the
termination
of
this
fearful
business
moreover
she
has
judgment
and
decision
of
character--she
will
advise
you
rightly
be
assured
that
she
would
advise
us
honourably
said
henry
and
that
we
should
feel
every
disposition
in
the
world
to
defer
to
her
wishes
our
proposition
is
not
to
be
doubted
but
little
shall
be
done
without
her
counsel
and
sanction
let
us
now
proceed
homeward
for
i
am
most
anxious
to
ascertain
how
it
came
about
that
she
and
sir
francis
varney
were
together
in
that
summer-house
at
so
strange
an
hour
they
all
three
walked
together
towards
the
house
conversing
in
a
similar
strain
as
they
went
the
consultation--the
duel
and
its
results
illustration
independent
of
this
interview
which
flora
had
had
with
the
much
dreaded
sir
francis
varney
the
circumstances
in
which
she
and
all
who
were
dear
to
her
happened
at
that
moment
to
be
placed
certainly
required
an
amount
of
consideration
which
could
not
be
too
soon
bestowed
by
a
combination
of
disagreeables
everything
that
could
possibly
occur
to
disturb
the
peace
of
the
family
seemed
to
have
taken
place
at
once
like
macbeth's
their
troubles
had
truly
come
in
battalions
and
now
that
the
serenity
of
their
domestic
position
was
destroyed
minor
evils
and
annoyances
which
that
very
serenity
had
enabled
them
to
hold
at
arm's-length
became
gigantic
and
added
much
to
their
distress
the
small
income
which
when
all
was
happiness
health
and
peace
was
made
to
constitute
a
comfortable
household
was
now
totally
inadequate
to
do
so--the
power
to
economise
and
to
make
the
most
of
a
little
had
flown
along
with
that
contentedness
of
spirit
which
the
harmony
of
circumstances
alone
could
produce
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
poor
mrs
bannerworth
could
now
as
she
had
formerly
done
when
her
mind
was
free
from
anxiety
attend
to
those
domestic
matters
which
make
up
the
comforts
of
a
family--distracted
at
the
situation
of
her
daughter
and
bewildered
by
the
rapid
succession
of
troublesome
events
which
so
short
a
period
of
time
had
given
birth
to
she
fell
into
an
inert
state
of
mind
as
different
as
anything
could
possibly
be
from
her
former
active
existence
it
has
likewise
been
seen
how
the
very
domestics
fled
from
bannerworth
hall
in
dismay
rather
than
remain
beneath
the
same
roof
with
a
family
believed
to
be
subject
to
the
visitations
of
so
awful
a
being
as
a
vampyre
among
the
class
who
occupy
positions
of
servitude
certainly
there
might
have
been
found
some
who
with
feelings
and
understandings
above
such
considerations
would
have
clung
sympathetically
to
that
family
in
distress
which
they
had
known
under
a
happier
aspect
but
it
had
not
been
the
good
fortune
of
the
bannerworths
to
have
such
as
these
about
them
hence
selfishness
had
its
way
and
they
were
deserted
it
was
not
likely
then
that
strangers
would
willingly
accept
service
in
a
family
so
situated
without
some
powerful
impulse
in
the
shape
of
a
higher
pecuniary
consideration
as
was
completely
out
of
the
power
of
the
bannerworths
to
offer
thus
was
it
then
that
most
cruelly
at
the
very
time
that
they
had
most
need
of
assistance
and
of
sympathy
this
unfortunate
family
almost
became
isolated
from
their
kind
and
apart
from
every
other
consideration
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
for
them
to
continue
inhabitants
of
the
hall
with
anything
like
comfort
or
advantage
and
then
although
the
disappearance
of
charles
holland
no
longer
awakened
those
feelings
of
indignation
at
his
supposed
perfidy
which
were
first
produced
by
that
event
still
view
it
in
which
way
they
might
it
was
a
severe
blow
of
fate
and
after
it
they
one
and
all
found
themselves
still
less
able
to
contend
against
the
sea
of
troubles
that
surrounded
them
the
reader
too
will
not
have
failed
to
remark
that
there
was
about
the
whole
of
the
family
that
pride
of
independence
which
induced
them
to
shrink
from
living
upon
extraneous
aid
and
hence
although
they
felt
and
felt
truly
that
when
admiral
bell
in
his
frank
manner
offered
them
pecuniary
assistance
that
it
was
no
idle
compliment
yet
with
a
sensitiveness
such
as
they
might
well
be
expected
to
feel
they
held
back
and
asked
each
other
what
prospect
there
was
of
emerging
from
such
a
state
of
things
and
if
it
were
justifiable
to
commence
a
life
of
dependence
the
end
of
which
was
not
evident
or
tangible
notwithstanding
too
the
noble
confidence
of
flora
in
her
lover
and
notwithstanding
that
confidence
had
been
echoed
by
her
brothers
there
would
at
times
obtrude
into
the
minds
of
the
latter
a
feeling
of
the
possibility
that
after
all
they
might
be
mistaken
and
charles
holland
might
from
some
sudden
impulse
fancying
his
future
happiness
was
all
at
stake
have
withdrawn
himself
from
the
hall
and
really
written
the
letters
attributed
to
him
we
say
this
only
obtruded
itself
occasionally
for
all
their
real
feelings
and
aspirations
were
the
other
way
although
mr
marchdale
they
could
perceive
had
his
doubts
and
they
could
not
but
confess
that
he
was
more
likely
to
view
the
matter
calmly
and
dispassionately
than
they
in
fact
the
very
hesitation
with
which
he
spoke
upon
the
subject
convinced
them
of
his
doubt
for
they
attributed
that
hesitation
to
a
fear
of
giving
them
pain
or
of
wounding
the
prejudices
of
admiral
bell
with
whom
he
had
already
had
words
so
nearly
approaching
to
a
quarrel
henry's
visit
to
mr
chillingworth
was
not
likely
to
be
productive
of
any
results
beyond
those
of
a
conjectural
character
all
that
that
gentleman
could
do
was
to
express
a
willingness
to
be
directed
by
them
in
any
way
rather
than
suggest
any
course
of
conduct
himself
upon
circumstances
which
he
could
not
be
expected
to
judge
of
as
they
who
were
on
the
spot
and
had
witnessed
their
actual
occurrence
and
now
we
will
suppose
that
the
reader
is
enabled
with
us
to
look
into
one
of
the
principal
rooms
of
bannerworth
hall
it
is
evening
and
some
candles
are
shedding
a
sickly
light
on
the
ample
proportions
of
the
once
handsome
apartment
at
solemn
consultation
the
whole
of
the
family
are
assembled
as
well
as
the
admiral
mr
chillingworth
and
marchdale
jack
pringle
too
walked
in
by
the
sufferance
of
his
master
as
if
he
considered
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
so
the
occasion
of
the
meeting
had
been
a
communication
which
flora
had
made
concerning
her
most
singular
and
deeply
interesting
interview
with
the
vampyre
the
details
of
this
interview
had
produced
a
deep
effect
upon
the
whole
of
the
family
flora
was
there
and
she
looked
better
calmer
and
more
collected
than
she
had
done
for
some
days
past
no
doubt
the
interview
she
had
had
with
varney
in
the
summer-house
in
the
garden
had
dispelled
a
host
of
imaginary
terrors
with
which
she
had
surrounded
him
although
it
had
confirmed
her
fully
that
he
and
he
only
was
the
dreadful
being
who
had
caused
her
so
much
misery
that
interview
had
tended
to
show
her
that
about
him
there
was
yet
something
human
and
that
there
was
not
a
danger
of
her
being
hunted
down
from
place
to
place
by
so
horrible
an
existence
such
a
feeling
as
this
was
of
course
a
source
of
deep
consolation
and
with
a
firmer
voice
and
more
of
her
old
spirit
of
cheerfulness
about
her
than
she
had
lately
exhibited
she
again
detailed
the
particulars
of
the
interview
to
all
who
had
assembled
concluding
by
saying--
and
this
has
given
me
hope
of
happier
days
if
it
be
a
delusion
it
is
a
happy
one
and
now
that
but
a
frightful
veil
of
mystery
still
hangs
over
the
fate
of
charles
holland
i
how
gladly
would
i
bid
adieu
to
this
place
and
all
that
has
made
it
terrible
i
could
almost
pity
sir
francis
varney
rather
than
condemn
him
that
may
be
true
said
henry
to
a
certain
extent
sister
but
we
never
can
forget
the
amount
of
misery
he
has
brought
upon
us
it
is
no
slight
thing
to
be
forced
from
our
old
and
much-loved
home
even
if
such
proceeding
does
succeed
in
freeing
us
from
his
persecutions
but
my
young
friend
said
marchdale
you
must
recollect
that
through
life
it
is
continually
the
lot
of
humanity
to
be
endeavouring
to
fly
from
great
evils
to
those
which
do
not
present
themselves
to
the
mind
in
so
bad
an
aspect
it
is
something
surely
to
alleviate
affliction
if
we
cannot
entirely
remove
it
that
is
true
said
mr
chillingworth
to
a
considerable
extent
but
then
it
takes
too
much
for
granted
to
please
me
how
so
sir
why
certainly
to
remove
from
bannerworth
hall
is
a
much
less
evil
than
to
remain
at
bannerworth
hall
and
be
haunted
by
a
vampyre
but
then
that
proposition
takes
for
granted
that
vampyre
business
which
i
will
never
grant
i
repeat
again
and
again
it
is
contrary
to
all
experience
to
philosophy
and
to
all
the
laws
of
ordinary
nature
facts
are
stubborn
things
said
marchdale
apparently
remarked
mr
chillingworth
well
sir
and
here
we
have
the
fact
of
a
vampyre
the
presumed
fact
one
swallow
don't
make
a
summer
mr
marchdale
this
is
waste
of
time
said
henry--of
course
the
amount
of
evidence
that
will
suffice
to
bring
conviction
to
one
man's
mind
will
fail
in
doing
so
to
another
the
question
is
what
are
we
to
do
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
flora
as
if
this
question
was
more
particularly
addressed
to
her
and
it
behoved
her
above
all
others
to
answer
it
she
did
so
and
in
a
firm
clear
voice
she
said--
i
will
discover
the
fate
of
charles
holland
and
then
leave
the
hall
the
fate
of
charles
holland
said
marchdale
why
really
unless
that
young
gentleman
chooses
to
be
communicative
himself
upon
so
interesting
a
subject
we
may
be
a
long
while
discovering
his
fate
i
know
that
it
is
not
a
romantic
view
to
take
of
the
question
to
suppose
simply
that
he
wrote
the
three
letters
found
upon
his
dressing-table
and
then
decamped
but
to
my
mind
it
savours
most
wonderfully
of
matter-of-fact
i
now
speak
more
freely
than
i
have
otherwise
done
for
i
am
now
upon
the
eve
of
my
departure
i
have
no
wish
to
remain
here
and
breed
dissension
in
any
family
or
to
run
a
tilt
against
anybody's
prejudices
here
he
looked
at
admiral
bell
i
leave
this
house
to-night
you're
a
d----d
lubberly
thief
said
the
admiral
the
sooner
you
leave
it
the
better
why
you
bad-looking
son
of
a
gun
what
do
you
mean
i
thought
we'd
had
enough
of
that
i
fully
expected
this
abuse
said
marchdale
did
you
expect
that
said
the
admiral
as
he
snatched
up
an
inkstand
and
threw
at
marchdale
hitting
him
a
hard
knock
on
the
chin
and
bespattering
its
contents
on
his
breast
now
i'll
give
you
satisfaction
you
lubber
d--me
if
you
ain't
a
second
jones
and
enough
to
sink
the
ship
shiver
my
timbers
if
i
sha'n't
say
something
strong
presently
i
really
said
henry
must
protest
admiral
bell
against
this
conduct
protest
and
be
d----d
mr
marchdale
may
be
right
sir
or
he
may
be
wrong
it's
a
matter
of
opinion
oh
never
mind
said
marchdale
i
look
upon
this
old
nautical
ruffian
as
something
between
a
fool
and
a
madman
if
he
were
a
younger
man
i
should
chastise
him
upon
the
spot
but
as
it
is
i
live
in
hopes
yet
of
getting
him
into
some
comfortable
lunatic
asylum
me
into
an
asylum
shouted
the
admiral
jack
did
you
hear
that
ay
ay
sir
farewell
all
of
you
said
marchdale
my
best
wishes
be
with
this
family
i
cannot
remain
under
this
roof
to
be
so
insulted
a
good
riddance
cried
the
admiral
i'd
rather
sail
round
the
world
with
a
shipload
of
vampyres
than
with
such
a
humbugging
son
of
a
gun
as
you
are
d----e
you're
worse
than
a
lawyer
nay
nay
cried
they
mr
marchdale
stay
stay
stay
cried
george
and
mrs
bannerworth
likewise
said
stay
but
at
the
moment
flora
stepped
forward
and
in
a
clear
voice
she
said--
no
let
him
go
he
doubts
charles
holland
let
all
go
who
doubt
charles
holland
mr
marchdale
heaven
forgive
you
this
injustice
you
are
doing
we
may
never
meet
again
farewell
sir
these
words
were
spoken
in
so
decided
a
tone
that
no
one
contradicted
them
marchdale
cast
a
strange
kind
of
look
round
upon
the
family
circle
and
in
another
instant
he
was
gone
huzza
shouted
jack
pringle
that's
one
good
job
henry
looked
rather
resentful
which
the
admiral
could
not
but
observe
and
so
less
with
the
devil-may-care
manner
in
which
he
usually
spoke
the
old
man
addressed
him
hark
ye
mr
henry
bannerworth
you
ain't
best
pleased
with
me
and
in
that
case
i
don't
know
that
i
shall
stay
to
trouble
you
any
longer
as
for
your
friend
who
has
left
you
sooner
or
later
you'll
find
him
out--i
tell
you
there's
no
good
in
that
fellow
do
you
think
i've
been
cruizing
about
for
a
matter
of
sixty
years
and
don't
know
an
honest
man
when
i
see
him
but
never
mind
i'm
going
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
for
my
nephew
and
you
can
do
as
you
like
heaven
only
knows
admiral
bell
said
henry
who
is
right
and
who
is
wrong
i
do
much
regret
that
you
have
quarrelled
with
mr
marchdale
but
what
is
done
can't
be
undone
do
not
leave
us
said
flora
let
me
beg
of
you
admiral
bell
not
to
leave
us
for
my
sake
remain
here
for
to
you
i
can
speak
freely
and
with
confidence
of
charles
when
probably
i
can
do
so
to
no
one
else
you
knew
him
well
and
have
a
confidence
in
him
which
no
one
else
can
aspire
to
i
pray
you
therefore
to
stay
with
us
only
on
one
condition
said
the
admiral
name
it--name
it
you
think
of
letting
the
hall
yes
yes
let
me
have
it
then
and
let
me
pay
a
few
years
in
advance
if
you
don't
i'm
d----d
if
i
stay
another
night
in
the
place
you
must
give
me
immediate
possession
too
and
stay
here
as
my
guests
until
you
suit
yourselves
elsewhere
those
are
my
terms
and
conditions
say
yes
and
all's
right
say
no
and
i'm
off
like
a
round
shot
from
a
carronade
d----me
that's
the
thing
jack
isn't
it
ay
ay
sir
there
was
a
silence
of
some
few
moments
after
this
extraordinary
offer
had
been
made
and
then
they
spoke
saying--
admiral
bell
your
generous
offer
and
the
feelings
which
dictated
it
are
by
far
too
transparent
for
us
to
affect
not
to
understand
them
your
actions
admiral--
oh
bother
my
actions
what
are
they
to
you
come
now
i
consider
myself
master
of
the
house
d--n
you
i
invite
you
all
to
dinner
or
supper
or
to
whatever
meal
comes
next
mrs
bannerworth
will
you
oblige
me
as
i'm
an
old
fool
in
family
affairs
by
buying
what's
wanted
for
me
and
my
guests
there's
the
money
ma'am
come
along
jack
we'll
take
a
look
over
our
new
house
what
do
you
think
of
it
wants
some
sheathing
sir
here
and
there
very
like
but
however
it
will
do
well
enough
for
us
we're
in
port
you
know
come
along
ay
ay
sir
and
off
went
the
admiral
and
jack
after
leaving
a
twenty
pound
note
in
mrs
bannerworth's
lap
sir
francis
varney's
separate
opponents--the
interposition
of
flora
illustration
the
old
admiral
so
completely
overcame
the
family
of
the
bannerworths
by
his
generosity
and
evident
single-mindedness
of
his
behaviour
that
although
not
one
except
flora
approved
of
his
conduct
towards
mr
marchdale
yet
they
could
not
help
liking
him
and
had
they
been
placed
in
a
position
to
choose
which
of
the
two
they
would
have
had
remain
with
them
the
admiral
or
marchdale
there
can
be
no
question
they
would
have
made
choice
of
the
former
still
however
it
was
not
pleasant
to
find
a
man
like
marchdale
virtually
driven
from
the
house
because
he
presumed
to
differ
in
opinion
upon
a
very
doubtful
matter
with
another
of
its
inmates
but
as
it
was
the
nature
of
the
bannerworth
family
always
to
incline
to
the
most
generous
view
of
subjects
the
frank
hearty
confidence
of
the
old
admiral
in
charles
holland
pleased
them
better
than
the
calm
and
serious
doubting
of
marchdale
his
ruse
of
hiring
the
house
of
them
and
paying
the
rent
in
advance
for
the
purpose
of
placing
ample
funds
in
their
hands
for
any
contingency
was
not
the
less
amiable
because
it
was
so
easily
seen
through
and
they
could
not
make
up
their
minds
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
the
old
man
by
the
rejection
of
his
generous
offer
when
he
had
left
this
subject
was
canvassed
among
them
and
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
have
his
own
way
in
the
matter
for
the
present
although
they
hoped
to
hear
something
from
marchdale
which
should
make
his
departure
appear
less
abrupt
and
uncomfortable
to
the
whole
of
the
family
during
the
course
of
this
conversation
it
was
made
known
to
flora
with
more
distinctness
than
under
any
other
circumstances
it
would
have
been
that
george
holland
had
been
on
the
eve
of
fighting
a
duel
with
sir
francis
varney
previous
to
his
mysterious
disappearance
when
she
became
fully
aware
of
this
fact
to
her
mind
it
seemed
materially
to
add
to
the
suspicions
previously
to
then
entertained
that
foul
means
had
been
used
in
order
to
put
charles
out
of
the
way
who
knows
she
said
that
this
varney
may
not
shrink
with
the
greatest
terror
from
a
conflict
with
any
human
being
and
feeling
one
was
inevitable
with
charles
holland
unless
interrupted
by
some
vigorous
act
of
his
own
he
or
some
myrmidons
of
his
may
have
taken
charles's
life
i
do
not
think
flora
said
henry
that
he
would
have
ventured
upon
so
desperate
an
act
i
cannot
well
believe
such
a
thing
possible
but
fear
not
he
will
find
if
he
have
really
committed
any
such
atrocity
that
it
will
not
save
him
these
words
of
henry
though
it
made
no
impression
at
the
time
upon
flora
beyond
what
they
carried
upon
their
surface
they
really
however
as
concerned
henry
himself
implied
a
settled
resolution
which
he
immediately
set
about
reducing
to
practice
when
the
conference
broke
up
night
as
it
still
was
he
without
saying
anything
to
any
one
took
his
hat
and
cloak
and
left
the
hall
proceeding
by
the
nearest
practicable
route
to
the
residence
of
sir
francis
varney
where
he
arrived
without
any
interruption
of
any
character
varney
was
at
first
denied
to
him
but
before
he
could
leave
the
house
a
servant
came
down
the
great
staircase
to
say
it
was
a
mistake
and
that
sir
francis
was
at
home
and
would
be
happy
to
see
him
he
was
ushered
into
the
same
apartment
where
sir
francis
varney
had
before
received
his
visitors
and
there
sat
the
now
declared
vampyre
looking
pale
and
ghastly
by
the
dim
light
which
burned
in
the
apartment
and
indeed
more
like
some
spectre
of
the
tomb
than
one
of
the
great
family
of
man
be
seated
sir
said
varney
although
my
eyes
have
seldom
the
pleasure
of
beholding
you
within
these
walls
be
assured
you
are
a
honoured
guest
sir
francis
varney
said
henry
i
came
not
here
to
bandy
compliments
with
you
i
have
none
to
pay
to
you
nor
do
i
wish
to
hear
any
of
them
from
your
lips
an
excellent
sentiment
young
man
said
varney
and
well
delivered
may
i
presume
then
without
infringing
too
far
upon
your
extreme
courtesy
to
inquire
to
what
circumstances
i
am
indebted
for
your
visit
to
one
sir
francis
that
i
believe
you
are
better
acquainted
with
than
you
will
have
the
candour
to
admit
indeed
sir
said
varney
coldly
you
measure
my
candour
probably
by
a
standard
of
your
own
in
which
case
i
fear
i
may
be
no
gainer
and
yet
that
may
be
of
itself
a
circumstance
that
should
afford
little
food
for
surprise
but
proceed
sir--since
we
have
so
few
compliments
to
stand
between
us
and
our
purpose
we
shall
in
all
due
time
arrive
at
it
yes
in
due
time
sir
francis
varney
and
that
due
time
has
arrived
know
you
anything
of
my
friend
mr
charles
holland
said
henry
in
marked
accents
and
he
gazed
on
sir
francis
varney
with
earnestness
that
seemed
to
say
not
even
a
look
should
escape
his
observation
varney
however
returned
the
gaze
as
steadily
but
coldly
as
he
replied
in
his
measured
accents--
i
have
heard
of
the
young
gentleman
and
seen
him
and
seen
him
too
as
you
mr
bannerworth
must
be
well
aware
surely
you
have
not
come
all
this
way
merely
to
make
such
an
inquiry
but
sir
you
are
welcome
to
the
answer
henry
had
something
of
a
struggle
to
keep
down
the
rising
anger
at
these
cool
taunts
of
varney
but
he
succeeded--and
then
he
said--
i
suspect
charles
holland
sir
francis
varney
has
met
with
unfair
treatment
and
that
he
has
been
unfairly
dealt
with
for
an
unworthy
purpose
undoubtedly
said
varney
if
the
gentleman
you
allude
to
has
been
unfairly
dealt
with
it
was
for
a
foul
purpose
for
no
good
or
generous
object
my
young
sir
could
be
so
obtained--you
acknowledge
so
much
i
doubt
not
i
do
sir
francis
varney
and
hence
the
purpose
of
my
visit
here--for
this
reason
i
apply
to
you--
a
singular
object
supported
by
a
singular
reason
i
cannot
see
the
connection
young
sir
pray
proceed
to
enlighten
me
upon
this
matter
and
when
you
have
done
that
may
i
presume
upon
your
consideration
to
inquire
in
what
way
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
sir
francis
said
henry
his
anger
raising
his
tones--this
will
not
serve
you--i
have
come
to
exact
an
account
of
how
you
have
disposed
of
my
friend
and
i
will
have
it
gently
my
good
sir
you
are
aware
i
know
nothing
of
your
friend
his
motions
are
his
own
and
as
to
what
i
have
done
with
him
my
only
answer
is
that
he
would
permit
me
to
do
nothing
with
him
had
i
been
so
inclined
to
have
taken
the
liberty
you
are
suspected
sir
francis
varney
of
having
made
an
attempt
upon
the
life
or
liberty
of
charles
holland
you
in
fact
are
suspected
of
being
his
murderer--and
so
help
me
heaven
if
i
have
not
justice
i
will
have
vengeance
young
sir
your
words
are
of
grave
import
and
ought
to
be
coolly
considered
before
they
are
uttered
with
regard
to
justice
and
vengeance
mr
bannerworth
you
may
have
both
but
i
tell
you
of
charles
holland
or
what
has
become
of
him
i
know
nothing
but
wherefore
do
you
come
to
so
unlikely
a
quarter
to
learn
something
of
an
individual
of
whom
i
know
nothing
because
charles
holland
was
to
have
fought
a
duel
with
you
but
before
that
had
time
to
take
place
he
has
suddenly
become
missing
i
suspect
that
you
are
the
author
of
his
disappearance
because
you
fear
an
encounter
with
a
mortal
man
mr
bannerworth
permit
me
to
say
in
my
own
defence
that
i
do
not
fear
any
man
however
foolish
he
may
be
and
wisdom
is
not
an
attribute
i
find
from
experience
in
all
men
of
your
friend
however
you
must
be
dreaming
sir--a
kind
of
vivid
insanity
has
taken
possession
of
your
mind
which
distorts--
sir
francis
varney
exclaimed
henry
now
perfectly
uncontrollable
sir
said
varney
as
he
filled
up
the
pause
proceed
i
am
all
attention
you
do
me
honour
if
resumed
henry
such
was
your
object
in
putting
mr
holland
aside
by
becoming
personally
or
by
proxy
an
assassin
you
are
mistaken
in
supposing
you
have
accomplished
your
object
go
on
sir
said
sir
francis
varney
in
a
bland
and
sweet
tone
i
am
all
attention
pray
proceed
you
have
failed
for
i
now
here
on
this
spot
defy
you
to
mortal
combat
coward
assassin
as
you
are
i
challenge
you
to
fight
you
don't
mean
on
the
carpet
here
said
varney
deliberately
no
sir
but
beneath
the
canopy
of
heaven
in
the
light
of
the
day
and
then
sir
francis
we
shall
see
who
will
shrink
from
the
conflict
it
is
remarkably
good
mr
bannerworth
and
begging
your
pardon
for
i
do
not
wish
to
give
any
offence
my
honoured
sir
it
would
rehearse
before
an
audience
in
short
sir
it
is
highly
dramatic
you
shrink
from
the
combat
do
you
now
indeed
i
know
you
young
man--young
man
said
sir
francis
calmly
and
shaking
his
head
very
deliberately
and
the
shadows
passed
across
his
pale
face
you
know
me
not
if
you
think
sir
francis
varney
shrinks
from
any
man
much
less
one
like
yourself
you
are
a
coward
and
worse
if
you
refuse
my
challenge
i
do
not
refuse
it
i
accept
it
said
varney
calmly
and
in
a
dignified
manner
and
then
with
a
sneer
he
added--you
are
well
acquainted
with
the
mode
in
which
gentlemen
generally
manage
these
matters
mr
bannerworth
and
perhaps
i
am
somewhat
confined
in
my
knowledge
in
the
ways
of
the
world
because
you
are
your
own
principal
and
second
in
all
my
experience
i
never
met
with
a
similar
case
the
circumstances
under
which
it
is
given
are
as
unexampled
and
will
excuse
the
mode
of
the
challenge
said
henry
with
much
warmth
singular
coincidence--the
challenge
and
mode
of
it
is
most
singular
they
are
well
matched
in
that
respect
singular
did
i
say
the
more
i
think
of
it
mr
bannerworth
the
more
i
am
inclined
to
think
this
positively
odd
early
to-morrow
sir
francis
you
shall
hear
from
me
in
that
case
you
will
not
arrange
preliminaries
now
well
well
it
is
very
unusual
for
the
principals
themselves
to
do
so
and
yet
excuse
my
freedom
i
presumed
as
you
had
so
far
deserted
the
beaten
track
that
i
had
no
idea
how
far
you
might
be
disposed
to
lead
the
same
route
i
have
said
all
i
intended
to
say
sir
francis
varney
we
shall
see
each
other
again
i
may
not
detain
you
i
presume
to
taste
aught
in
the
way
of
refreshment
henry
made
no
reply
but
turned
towards
the
door
without
even
making
an
attempt
to
return
the
grave
and
formal
bow
that
sir
francis
varney
made
as
he
saw
him
about
to
quit
the
apartment
for
henry
saw
that
his
pale
features
were
lighted
up
with
a
sarcastic
smile
most
disagreeable
to
look
upon
as
well
as
irritating
to
henry
bannerworth
he
now
quitted
sir
francis
varney's
abode
being
let
out
by
a
servant
who
had
been
rung
for
for
that
purpose
by
his
master
henry
walked
homeward
satisfied
that
he
had
now
done
all
that
he
could
under
the
circumstances
i
will
send
chillingworth
to
him
in
the
morning
and
then
i
shall
see
what
all
this
will
end
in
he
must
meet
me
and
then
charles
holland
if
not
discovered
shall
be
at
least
revenged
there
was
another
person
in
bannerworth
hall
who
had
formed
a
similar
resolution
that
person
was
a
very
different
sort
of
person
to
henry
bannerworth
though
quite
as
estimable
in
his
way
this
was
no
other
than
the
old
admiral
it
was
singular
that
two
such
very
different
persons
should
deem
the
same
steps
necessary
and
both
keep
the
secret
from
each
other
but
so
it
was
and
after
some
internal
swearing
he
determined
upon
challenging
varney
in
person
i'd
send
jack
pringle
but
the
swab
would
settle
the
matter
as
shortly
as
if
a
youngster
was
making
an
entry
in
a
log
and
heard
the
boatswain's
whistle
summoning
the
hands
to
a
mess
and
feared
he
would
lose
his
grog
d--n
my
quarters
but
sir
francis
varney
as
he
styles
himself
sha'n't
make
any
way
against
old
admiral
bell
he's
as
tough
as
a
hawser
and
just
the
sort
of
blade
for
a
vampyre
to
come
athwart
i'll
pitch
him
end-long
and
make
a
plank
of
him
afore
long
cus
my
windpipe
what
a
long
lanky
swab
he
is
with
teeth
fit
to
unpick
a
splice
but
let
me
alone
i'll
see
if
i
can't
make
a
hull
of
his
carcass
vampyre
or
no
vampyre
my
nevy
charles
holland
can't
be
allowed
to
cut
away
without
nobody's
leave
or
licence
no
no
i'll
not
stand
that
anyhow
'never
desert
a
messmate
in
the
time
of
need'
is
the
first
maxim
of
a
seaman
and
i
ain't
the
one
as
'll
do
so
thus
self-communing
the
old
admiral
marched
along
until
he
came
to
sir
francis
varney's
house
at
the
gate
of
which
he
gave
the
bell
what
he
called
a
long
pull
a
strong
pull
and
a
pull
altogether
that
set
it
ringing
with
a
fury
the
like
of
which
had
never
certainly
been
heard
by
the
household
a
minute
or
two
scarcely
elapsed
before
the
domestics
hurried
to
answer
so
urgent
a
summons
and
when
the
gate
was
opened
the
servant
who
answered
it
inquired
his
business
what's
that
to
you
snob
is
your
master
sir
francis
varney
in
because
if
he
be
let
him
know
old
admiral
bell
wants
to
speak
to
him
d'ye
hear
yes
sir
replied
the
servant
who
had
paused
a
few
moments
to
examine
the
individual
who
gave
this
odd
kind
of
address
in
another
minute
word
was
brought
to
him
that
sir
francis
varney
would
be
very
happy
to
see
admiral
bell
ay
ay
he
muttered
just
as
the
devil
likes
to
meet
with
holy
water
or
as
i
like
any
water
save
salt
water
he
was
speedily
introduced
to
sir
francis
varney
who
was
seated
in
the
same
posture
as
he
had
been
left
by
henry
bannerworth
not
many
minutes
before
admiral
bell
said
sir
francis
rising
and
bowing
to
that
individual
in
the
most
polite
calm
and
dignified
manner
imaginable
permit
me
to
express
the
honour
i
feel
at
this
unexpected
visit
none
of
your
gammon
will
you
be
seated
allow
me
to
offer
you
such
refreshments
as
this
poor
house
affords
d--n
all
this
you
know
sir
francis
i
don't
want
none
o'
this
palaver
it's
for
all
the
world
like
a
frenchman
when
you
are
going
to
give
him
a
broadside
he
makes
grimaces
throws
dust
in
your
eyes
and
tries
to
stab
you
in
the
back
oh
no
none
of
that
for
me
i
should
say
not
admiral
bell
i
should
not
like
it
myself
and
i
dare
say
you
are
a
man
of
too
much
experience
not
to
perceive
when
you
are
or
are
not
imposed
upon
well
what
is
that
to
you
d--n
me
i
didn't
come
here
to
talk
to
you
about
myself
then
may
i
presume
upon
your
courtesy
so
far
as
to
beg
that
you
will
enlighten
me
upon
the
object
of
your
visit
yes
in
pretty
quick
time
just
tell
me
where
you
have
stowed
away
my
nephew
charles
holland
really
i--
hold
your
slack
will
you
and
hear
me
out
if
he's
living
let
him
out
and
i'll
say
no
more
about
it
that's
liberal
you
know
it
ain't
terms
everybody
would
offer
you
i
must
in
truth
admit
they
are
not
and
moreover
they
quite
surprise
even
me
and
i
have
learned
not
to
be
surprised
at
almost
anything
well
will
you
give
him
up
alive
but
hark
ye
you
mustn't
have
made
very
queer
fish
of
him
do
ye
see
i
hear
you
said
sir
francis
with
a
bland
smile
passing
one
hand
gently
over
the
other
and
showing
his
front
teeth
in
a
peculiar
manner
but
i
really
cannot
comprehend
all
this
but
i
may
say
generally
that
mr
holland
is
no
acquaintance
of
mine
and
i
have
no
sort
of
knowledge
where
he
may
be
that
won't
do
for
me
said
the
admiral
positively
shaking
his
head
i
am
particularly
sorry
admiral
bell
that
it
will
not
seeing
that
i
have
nothing
else
to
say
i
see
how
it
is
you've
put
him
out
of
the
way
and
i'm
d----d
if
you
shan't
bring
him
to
life
whole
and
sound
or
i'll
know
the
reason
why
with
that
i
have
already
furnished
you
admiral
bell
quietly
rejoined
varney
anything
more
on
that
head
is
out
of
my
power
though
my
willingness
to
oblige
a
person
of
such
consideration
as
yourself
is
very
great
but
permit
me
to
add
this
is
a
very
strange
and
odd
communication
from
one
gentleman
to
another
you
have
lost
a
relative
who
has
very
probably
taken
some
offence
or
some
notion
into
his
head
of
which
nobody
but
himself
knows
anything
and
you
come
to
one
yet
more
unlikely
to
know
anything
of
him
than
even
yourself
gammon
again
now
sir
francis
varney
or
blarney
varney
if
you
please
admiral
bell
i
was
christened
varney
christened
eh
yes
christened--were
you
not
christened
if
not
i
dare
say
you
understand
the
ceremony
well
enough
illustration
i
should
think
i
did
but
as
for
christening
a--
go
on
sir
a
vampyre
why
i
should
as
soon
think
of
reading
the
burial
service
of
a
pig
very
possible
but
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
your
visit
to
me
this
much
you
lubber
now
d--n
my
carcass
from
head
to
stern
if
i
don't
call
you
out
well
admiral
bell
slid
varney
mildly
in
that
case
i
suppose
i
must
come
out
but
why
do
you
insist
that
i
have
any
knowledge
of
your
nephew
mr
charles
holland
you
were
to
have
fought
a
duel
with
him
and
now
he's
gone
i
am
here
said
varney
ay
said
the
admiral
that's
as
plain
as
a
purser's
shirt
upon
a
handspike
but
that's
the
very
reason
why
my
nevey
ain't
here
and
that's
all
about
it
and
that's
marvellous
little
so
far
as
the
sense
is
concerned
said
varney
without
the
movement
of
a
muscle
it
is
said
that
people
of
your
class
don't
like
fighting
mortal
men
now
you
have
disposed
of
him
lest
he
should
dispose
of
you
that
is
explicit
but
it
is
to
no
purpose
since
the
gentleman
in
question
hasn't
placed
himself
at
my
disposal
then
d----e
i
will
fish
flesh
or
fowl
i
don't
care
all's
one
to
admiral
bell
come
fair
or
fowl
i'm
a
tar
for
all
men
a
seaman
ever
ready
to
face
a
foe
so
here
goes
you
lubberly
moon
manufactured
calf
i
hear
admiral
but
it
is
scarcely
civil
to
say
the
least
of
it
however
as
you
are
somewhat
eccentric
and
do
not
i
dare
say
mean
all
your
words
imply
i
am
quite
willing
to
make
every
allowance
i
don't
want
any
allowance
d--n
you
and
your
allowance
too
nothing
but
allowance
of
grog
and
a
pretty
good
allowance
too
will
do
for
me
and
tell
you
sir
francis
varney
said
the
admiral
with
much
wrath
that
you
are
a
d----d
lubberly
hound
and
i'll
fight
you
yes
i'm
ready
to
hammer
away
or
with
anything
from
a
pop-gun
to
a
ship's
gun
you
don't
come
over
me
with
your
gammon
i
tell
you
you've
murdered
charles
holland
because
you
couldn't
face
him--that's
the
truth
of
it
with
the
other
part
of
your
speech
admiral
bell
allow
me
to
say
you
have
mixed
up
a
serious
accusation--one
i
cannot
permit
to
pass
lightly
will
you
or
not
fight
oh
yes
i
shall
be
happy
to
serve
you
any
way
that
i
can
i
hope
this
will
be
an
answer
to
your
accusation
also
that's
settled
then
why
i
am
not
captious
admiral
bell
but
it
is
not
generally
usual
for
the
principals
to
settle
the
preliminaries
themselves
doubtless
you
in
your
career
of
fame
and
glory
know
something
of
the
manner
in
which
gentlemen
demean
themselves
on
these
occasions
oh
d--n
you
yes
i'll
send
some
one
to
do
all
this
yes
yes
jack
pringle
will
be
the
man
though
jack
ain't
a
holiday
shore-going
smooth-spoken
swab
but
as
good
a
seaman
as
ever
trod
deck
or
handled
a
boarding-pike
any
friend
of
yours
said
varney
blandly
will
be
received
and
treated
as
such
upon
an
errand
of
such
consequence
and
now
our
conference
has
i
presume
concluded
yes
yes
i've
done--d----e
no--yes--no
i
will
keel-haul
you
but
i'll
know
something
of
my
neavy
charles
holland
good
day
admiral
bell
as
varney
spoke
he
placed
his
hand
upon
the
bell
which
he
had
near
him
to
summon
an
attendant
to
conduct
the
admiral
out
the
latter
who
had
said
a
vast
deal
more
than
he
ever
intended
left
the
room
in
a
great
rage
protesting
to
himself
that
he
would
amply
avenge
his
nephew
charles
holland
he
proceeded
homeward
considerably
vexed
and
annoyed
that
he
had
been
treated
with
so
much
calmness
and
all
knowledge
of
his
nephew
denied
when
he
got
back
he
quarrelled
heartily
with
jack
pringle--made
it
up--drank
grog--quarrelled--made
it
up
and
finished
with
grog
again--until
he
went
to
bed
swearing
he
should
like
to
fire
a
broadside
at
the
whole
of
the
french
army
and
annihilate
it
at
once
with
this
wish
he
fell
asleep
early
next
morning
henry
bannerworth
sought
mr
chillingworth
and
having
found
him
he
said
in
a
serious
tone--
mr
chillingworth
i
have
rather
a
serious
favour
to
ask
you
and
one
which
you
may
hesitate
in
granting
it
must
be
very
serious
indeed
said
mr
chillingworth
that
i
should
hesitate
to
grant
it
to
you
but
pray
inform
me
what
it
is
that
you
deem
so
serious
sir
francis
varney
and
i
must
have
a
meeting
said
henry
have
you
really
determined
upon
such
a
course
said
mr
chillingworth
you
know
the
character
of
your
adversary
that
is
all
settled--i
have
given
a
challenge
and
he
has
accepted
it
so
all
other
considerations
verge
themselves
into
one--and
that
is
the
when
where
and
how
i
see
said
mr
chillingworth
well
since
it
cannot
be
helped
on
your
part
i
will
do
what
is
requisite
for
you--do
you
wish
anything
to
be
done
or
insisted
on
in
particular
in
this
affair
nothing
with
regard
to
sir
francis
varney
that
i
may
not
leave
to
your
discretion
i
feel
convinced
that
he
is
the
assassin
of
charles
holland
whom
he
feared
to
fight
in
duel
then
there
remains
but
little
else
to
do
but
to
arrange
preliminaries
i
believe
are
you
prepared
on
every
other
point
i
am--you
will
see
that
i
am
the
challenger
and
that
he
must
now
fight
what
accident
may
turn
up
to
save
him
i
fear
not
but
sure
i
am
that
he
will
endeavour
to
take
every
advantage
that
may
arise
and
so
escape
the
encounter
and
what
do
you
imagine
he
will
do
now
he
has
accepted
your
challenge
said
mr
chillingworth
one
would
imagine
he
could
not
very
well
escape
no--but
he
accepted
the
challenge
which
charles
holland
sent
him--a
duel
was
inevitable
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
necessary
consequence
that
he
disappeared
from
amongst
us
for
mr
holland
would
never
have
shrunk
from
the
encounter
there
can
be
no
sort
of
suspicion
about
that
remarked
chillingworth
but
allow
me
to
advise
you
that
you
take
care
of
yourself
and
keep
a
watchful
eye
upon
every
one--do
not
be
seen
out
alone
i
fear
not
nay
the
gentleman
who
has
disappeared
was
i
am
sure
fearless
enough
but
yet
that
has
not
saved
him
i
would
not
advise
you
to
be
fearful
only
watchful
you
have
now
an
event
awaiting
upon
you
which
it
is
well
you
should
go
through
with
unless
circumstances
should
so
turn
out
that
it
is
needless
therefore
i
say
when
you
have
the
suspicions
you
do
entertain
of
this
man's
conduct
beware
be
cautious
and
vigilant
i
will
do
so--in
the
mean
time
i
trust
myself
confidently
in
your
hands--you
know
all
that
is
necessary
this
affair
is
quite
a
secret
from
all
of
the
family
most
certainly
so
and
will
remain
so--i
shall
be
at
the
hall
and
there
i
will
see
you--but
be
careful
not
to
be
drawn
into
any
adventure
of
any
kind--it
is
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
under
all
circumstances
i
will
be
especially
careful
be
assured
but
farewell
see
sir
francis
varney
as
early
as
you
can
and
let
the
meeting
be
as
early
as
you
can
and
thus
diminish
the
chance
of
accident
that
i
will
attend
to
farewell
for
the
present
mr
chillingworth
immediately
set
about
the
conducting
of
the
affair
thus
confided
to
him
and
that
no
time
might
be
lost
he
determined
to
set
out
at
once
for
sir
francis
varney's
residence
things
with
regard
to
this
family
seem
to
have
gone
on
wild
of
late
thought
mr
chillingworth
this
may
bring
affairs
to
a
conclusion
though
i
had
much
rather
they
had
come
to
some
other
my
life
for
it
there
is
a
juggle
or
a
mystery
somewhere
i
will
do
this
and
then
we
shall
see
what
will
come
of
it
if
this
sir
francis
varney
meets
him--and
at
this
moment
i
can
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
do
so--it
will
tend
much
to
deprive
him
of
the
mystery
about
him
but
if
on
the
other
hand
he
refuse--but
then
that's
all
improbable
because
he
has
agreed
to
do
so
i
fear
however
that
such
a
man
as
varney
is
a
dreadful
enemy
to
encounter--he
is
cool
and
unruffled--and
that
gives
him
all
the
advantage
in
such
affairs
but
henry's
nerves
are
not
bad
though
shaken
by
these
untowards
events
but
time
will
show--i
would
it
were
all
over
with
these
thoughts
and
feelings
strangely
intermixed
mr
chillingworth
set
forward
for
sir
francis
varney's
house





admiral
bell
slept
soundly
enough
though
towards
morning
he
fell
into
a
strange
dream
and
thought
he
was
yard
arm
and
yard
arm
with
a
strange
fish--something
of
the
mermaid
species
well
exclaimed
the
admiral
after
a
customary
benediction
of
his
eyes
and
limbs
what's
to
come
next
may
i
be
spliced
to
a
shark
if
i
understand
what
this
is
all
about
i
had
some
grog
last
night
but
then
grog
d'y'see
is--is--a
seaman's
native
element
as
the
newspapers
say
though
i
never
read
'em
now
it's
such
a
plague
he
lay
quiet
for
a
short
time
considering
in
his
own
mind
what
was
best
to
be
done
and
what
was
the
proper
course
to
pursue
and
why
he
should
dream
hilloa
hilloa
hil--loa
jack
a-hoy
a-hoy
shouted
the
admiral
as
a
sudden
recollection
of
his
challenge
came
across
his
memory
jack
pringle
a-hoy
d--n
you
where
are
you--you're
never
at
hand
when
you
are
wanted
oh
you
lubber--a-hoy
a-hoy
shouted
a
voice
as
the
door
opened
and
jack
thrust
his
head
in
what
cheer
messmate
what
ship
is
this
oh
you
lubberly--
the
door
was
shut
in
a
minute
and
jack
pringle
disappeared
hilloa
jack
pringle
you
don't
mean
to
say
you'll
desert
your
colours
do
you
you
dumb
dog
who
says
i'll
desert
the
ship
as
she's
sea-worthy
then
why
do
you
go
away
because
i
won't
be
called
lubberly
i'm
as
good
a
man
as
ever
swabbed
a
deck
and
don't
care
who
says
to
the
contrary
i'll
stick
to
the
ship
as
long
as
she's
seaworthy
said
jack
well
come
here
and
just
listen
to
the
log
and
be
d----d
to
you
what's
the
orders
now
admiral
said
jack
though
as
we
are
paid
off--
there
take
that
will
you
said
admiral
bell
as
he
flung
a
pillow
at
jack
being
the
only
thing
in
the
shape
of
a
missile
within
reach
jack
ducked
and
the
pillow
produced
a
clatter
in
the
washhand-stand
among
the
crockery
as
jack
said--
there's
a
mutiny
in
the
ship
and
hark
how
the
cargo
clatters
will
you
have
it
back
again
come
will
you
i've
been
dreaming
jack
dreaming
what's
that
thinking
of
something
when
you
are
asleep
you
swab
ha
ha
ha
laughed
jack
never
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life--ha
ha
ha
what's
the
matter
now
i'll
tell
you
what's
the
matter
jack
pringle
you
are
becoming
mutinous
and
i
won't
have
it
if
you
don't
hold
your
jaw
and
draw
in
your
slacks
i'll
have
another
second
another
second
what's
in
the
wind
now
said
jack
is
this
the
dream
if
ever
i
dream
when
i'm
alongside
a
strange
craft
then
it
is
a
dream
but
old
admiral
bell
ain't
the
man
to
sleep
when
there's
any
work
to
be
done
that's
uncommon
true
said
jack
turning
a
quid
well
then
i'm
going
to
fight
fight
exclaimed
jack
avast
there
i
don't
see
where's
the
enemy--none
o'
that
gammon
jack
pringle
can
fight
too
and
will
lay
alongside
his
admiral
but
he
don't
see
the
enemy
anywhere
you
don't
understand
these
things
so
i'll
tell
you
i
have
had
a
bit
of
talk
with
sir
francis
varney
and
i
am
going
to
fight
him
what
the
wamphigher
remarked
jack
parenthetically
yes
well
then
resumed
jack
then
we
shall
see
another
blaze
at
least
afore
we
die
but
he's
an
odd
fish--one
of
davy
jones's
sort
i
don't
care
about
that
he
may
be
anything
he
likes
but
admiral
bell
ain't
a-going
to
have
his
nephew
burned
and
eaten
and
sucked
like
i
don't
know
what
by
a
vampyre
or
by
any
other
confounded
land-shark
in
course
said
jack
we
ain't
a-going
to
put
up
with
nothing
of
that
sort
and
if
so
be
as
how
he
has
put
him
out
of
the
way
why
it's
our
duty
to
send
him
after
him
and
square
the
board
that's
the
thing
jack
now
you
know
you
must
go
to
sir
francis
varney
and
tell
him
you
come
from
me
i
don't
care
if
i
goes
on
my
own
account
said
jack
that
won't
do
i've
challenged
him
and
i
must
fight
him
in
course
you
will
returned
jack
and
if
he
blows
you
away
why
i'll
take
your
place
and
have
a
blaze
myself
the
admiral
gave
a
look
at
jack
of
great
admiration
and
then
said--
you
are
a
d----d
good
seaman
jack
but
he's
a
knight
and
might
say
no
to
that
but
do
you
go
to
him
and
tell
him
that
you
come
from
me
to
settle
the
when
and
the
where
this
duel
is
to
be
fought
single
fight
said
jack
yes
consent
to
any
thing
that
is
fair
said
the
admiral
but
let
it
be
as
soon
as
you
can
now
do
you
understand
what
i
have
said
yes
to
be
sure
i
ain't
lived
all
these
years
without
knowing
your
lingo
then
go
at
once
and
don't
let
the
honour
of
admiral
bell
and
old
england
suffer
jack
i'm
his
man
you
know
at
any
price
never
fear
said
jack
you
shall
fight
him
at
any
rate
i'll
go
and
see
he
don't
back
out
the
warmint
then
go
along
jack
and
mind
don't
you
go
blazing
away
like
a
fire
ship
and
letting
everybody
know
what's
going
on
or
it'll
be
stopped
i'll
not
spoil
sport
said
jack
as
he
left
the
room
to
go
at
once
to
sir
francis
varney
charged
with
the
conducting
of
the
important
cartel
of
the
admiral
jack
made
the
best
of
his
way
with
becoming
gravity
and
expedition
until
he
reached
the
gate
of
the
admiral's
enemy
jack
rang
loudly
at
the
gate
there
seemed
if
one
might
judge
by
his
countenance
a
something
on
his
mind
that
jack
was
almost
another
man
the
gate
was
opened
by
the
servant
who
inquired
what
he
wanted
there
the
wamphigher
who
the
wamphigher
the
servant
frowned
and
was
about
to
say
something
uncivil
to
jack
who
winked
at
him
very
hard
and
then
said--
oh
may
be
you
don't
know
him
or
won't
know
him
by
that
name
i
wants
to
see
sir
francis
varney
he's
at
home
said
the
servant
who
are
you
show
me
up
then
i'm
jack
pringle
and
i'm
come
from
admiral
bell
i'm
the
admiral's
friend
you
see
so
none
of
your
black
looks
the
servant
seemed
amazed
as
well
as
rather
daunted
at
jack's
address
he
showed
him
however
into
the
hall
where
mr
chillingworth
had
just
that
moment
arrived
and
was
waiting
for
an
interview
with
varney
marchdale's
offer--the
consultation
at
bannerworth
hall--the
morning
of
the
duel
illustration
mr
chillingworth
was
much
annoyed
to
see
jack
pringle
in
the
hall
and
jack
was
somewhat
surprised
at
seeing
mr
chillingworth
there
at
that
time
in
the
rooming
they
had
but
little
time
to
indulge
in
their
mutual
astonishment
for
a
servant
came
to
announce
that
sir
francis
varney
would
see
them
both
without
saying
anything
to
the
servant
or
each
other
they
ascended
the
staircase
and
were
shown
into
the
apartment
where
sir
francis
varney
received
them
gentlemen
said
sir
francis
in
his
usual
bland
tone
you
are
welcome
sir
francis
said
mr
chillingworth
i
have
come
upon
matters
of
some
importance
may
i
crave
a
separate
audience
and
i
too
said
jack
pringle
i
come
as
the
friend
of
admiral
bell
i
want
a
private
audience
but
stay
i
don't
care
a
rope's
end
who
knows
who
i
am
or
what
i
come
about
say
you
are
ready
to
name
time
and
place
and
i'm
as
dumb
as
a
figure-head
that
is
saying
something
at
all
events
and
now
i'm
done
why
gentlemen
said
sir
francis
with
a
quiet
smile
as
you
have
both
come
upon
the
same
errand
and
as
there
may
arise
a
controversy
upon
the
point
of
precedence
you
had
better
be
both
present
as
i
must
arrange
this
matter
myself
upon
due
inquiry
i
do
not
exactly
understand
this
said
mr
chillingworth
do
you
mr
pringle
perhaps
you
can
enlighten
me
it
said
jack
as
how
you
came
here
upon
the
same
errand
as
i
and
i
as
you
why
we
both
come
about
fighting
sir
francis
varney
yes
said
sir
francis
what
mr
pringle
says
is
i
believe
correct
to
a
letter
i
have
a
challenge
from
both
your
principals
and
am
ready
to
give
you
both
the
satisfaction
you
desire
provided
the
first
encounter
will
permit
me
the
honour
of
joining
in
the
second
you
mr
pringle
are
aware
of
the
chances
of
war
i
should
say
so
said
jack
with
a
wink
and
a
nod
of
a
familiar
character
i've
seen
a
few
of
them
will
you
proceed
to
make
the
necessary
agreement
between
you
both
gentlemen
my
affection
for
the
one
equals
fully
the
good
will
i
bear
the
other
and
i
cannot
give
a
preference
in
so
delicate
a
matter
proceed
gentlemen
mr
chillingworth
looked
at
jack
and
jack
pringle
looked
at
mr
chillingworth
and
then
the
former
said--
well
the
admiral
means
fighting
and
i
am
come
to
settle
the
necessaries
pray
let
me
know
what
are
your
terms
mr
what-d'ye-call'em
i
am
agreeable
to
anything
that
is
at
all
reasonable--pistols
i
presume
sir
francis
varney
said
mr
chillingworth
i
cannot
consent
to
carry
on
this
office
unless
you
can
appoint
a
friend
who
will
settle
these
matters
with
us--myself
at
least
and
i
too
said
jack
pringle
we
don't
want
to
bear
down
an
enemy
admiral
bell
ain't
the
man
to
do
that
and
if
he
were
i'm
not
the
man
to
back
him
in
doing
what
isn't
fair
or
right
but
he
won't
do
it
but
gentlemen
this
must
not
be
mr
henry
bannerworth
must
not
be
disappointed
and
admiral
bell
must
not
be
disappointed
moreover
i
have
accepted
the
two
cartels
and
i
am
ready
and
willing
to
fight--one
at
a
time
i
presume
sir
francis
after
what
you
have
said
i
must
take
upon
myself
on
the
part
of
mr
henry
bannerworth
to
decline
meeting
you
if
you
cannot
name
a
friend
with
whom
i
can
arrange
this
affair
ah
said
jack
pringle
that's
right
enough
i
recollect
very
well
when
jack
mizeu
fought
tom
foremast
they
had
their
seconds
admiral
bell
can't
do
anything
in
the
dark
no
no
d----e
all
must
be
above
board
gentlemen
said
sir
francis
varney
you
see
the
dilemma
i
am
in
your
principals
have
both
challenged
me
i
am
ready
to
fight
any
one
or
both
of
them
as
the
case
may
be
distinctly
understand
that
because
it
is
a
notion
of
theirs
that
i
will
not
do
so
or
that
i
shrink
from
them
but
i
am
a
stranger
in
this
neighbourhood
and
have
no
one
whom
i
could
call
upon
to
relinquish
so
much
as
they
run
the
risk
of
doing
by
attending
me
to
the
field
then
your
acquaintances
are
no
friends
d----e
said
jack
pringle
spitting
through
his
teeth
into
the
bars
of
a
beautifully
polished
grate
i'd
stick
to
anybody--the
devil
himself
leave
alone
a
vampyre--if
so
be
as
how
i
had
been
his
friends
and
drunk
grog
from
the
same
can
they
are
a
set
of
lubbers
i
have
not
been
here
long
enough
to
form
any
such
friendships
mr
chillingworth
but
can
confidently
rely
upon
your
honour
and
that
of
your
principal
and
will
freely
and
fairly
meet
him
but
sir
francis
you
forget
the
fact
in
transacting
myself
for
mr
bannerworth
and
this
person
or
admiral
bell
we
do
match
and
have
our
own
characters
at
stake
nay
more
our
lives
and
fortunes
these
may
be
small
but
they
are
everything
to
us
allow
me
to
say
on
my
own
behalf
that
i
will
not
permit
my
principal
to
meet
you
unless
you
can
name
a
second
as
is
usual
with
gentlemen
on
such
occasions
i
regret
while
i
declare
to
you
my
entire
willingness
to
meet
you
that
i
cannot
comply
through
utter
inability
to
do
so
with
your
request
let
this
go
forth
to
the
world
as
i
have
stated
it
and
let
it
be
an
answer
to
any
aspersions
that
may
be
uttered
as
to
my
unwillingness
to
fight
there
was
a
pause
of
some
moments
mr
chillingworth
was
resolved
that
come
of
it
what
would
he
would
not
permit
henry
to
fight
unless
sir
francis
varney
himself
should
appoint
a
friend
and
then
they
could
meet
upon
equal
terms
jack
pringle
whistled
and
spit
and
chewed
and
turned
his
quid--hitched
up
his
trousers
and
looked
wistfully
from
one
to
the
other
as
he
said--
so
then
it's
likely
to
be
no
fight
at
all
sir
francis
what's-o'-name
it
seems
like
it
mr
pringle
replied
varney
with
a
meaning
smile
unless
you
can
be
more
complaisant
towards
myself
and
kind
towards
the
admiral
why
not
exactly
that
said
jack
it's
a
pity
to
stop
a
good
play
in
the
beginning
just
because
some
little
thing
is
wrong
in
the
tackling
perhaps
your
skill
and
genius
may
enable
us
to
find
some
medium
course
that
we
may
pursue
with
pleasure
and
profit
what
say
you
mr
pringle
all
i
know
about
genius
as
you
call
it
is
the
flying
dutchman
or
some
such
odd
out
of
the
way
fish
but
as
i
said
i
am
not
one
to
spoil
sport
nor
more
is
the
admiral
oh
no
we
is
all
true
men
and
good
i
believe
it
said
varney
bowing
politely
you
needn't
keep
your
figure-head
on
the
move
i
can
see
you
just
as
well
howsoever
as
i
was
saying
i
don't
like
to
spoil
sport
and
sooner
than
both
parties
should
be
disappointed
my
principal
shall
become
your
second
sir
francis
what
admiral
bell
exclaimed
varney
lifting
his
eyebrows
with
surprise
what
charles
holland's
uncle
exclaimed
mr
chillingworth
in
accents
of
amazement
and
why
not
said
jack
with
great
gravity
i
will
pledge
my
word--jack
pringle's
word--that
admiral
bell
shall
be
second
to
sir
francis
varney
during
his
scrimmage
with
mr
henry
bannerworth
that
will
let
the
matter
go
on
there
can
be
no
back-out
then
eh
continued
jack
pringle
with
a
knowing
nod
at
chillingworth
as
he
spoke
that
will
i
hope
remove
your
scruples
mr
chillingworth
said
varney
with
a
courteous
smile
but
will
admiral
bell
do
this
his
second
says
so
and
has
i
daresay
influence
enough
with
him
to
induce
that
person
to
act
in
conformity
with
his
promise
in
course
he
will
do
you
think
he
would
be
the
man
to
hang
back
oh
no
he
would
be
the
last
to
leave
jack
pringle
in
the
lurch--no
depend
upon
it
sir
francis
he'll
be
as
sure
to
do
what
i
say
as
i
have
said
it
after
that
assurance
i
cannot
doubt
it
said
sir
francis
varney
this
act
of
kindness
will
indeed
lay
me
under
a
deep
and
lasting
obligation
to
admiral
bell
which
i
fear
i
shall
never
be
able
to
pay
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
about
that
said
jack
pringle
the
admiral
will
credit
all
and
you
can
pay
off
old
scores
when
his
turn
comes
in
the
field
i
will
not
forget
said
varney
he
deserves
every
consideration
but
now
mr
chillingworth
i
presume
that
we
may
come
to
some
understanding
respecting
this
meeting
which
you
were
so
kind
as
to
do
me
the
honour
of
seeking
i
cannot
object
to
its
taking
place
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
meet
your
second
in
the
field
and
will
arrange
with
him
i
imagine
that
under
the
circumstances
that
it
will
be
barely
necessary
to
go
to
that
length
of
ceremony
future
interviews
can
be
arranged
later
name
the
time
and
place
and
after
that
we
can
settle
all
the
rest
on
the
ground
yes
said
jack
it
will
be
time
enough
surely
to
see
the
admiral
when
we
are
upon
the
ground
i'll
warrant
the
old
buffer
is
a
true
brick
as
ever
was
there's
no
flinching
about
him
i
am
satisfied
said
varney
and
i
also
said
chillingworth
but
understand
sir
francis
any
default
for
seconds
makes
the
meeting
a
blank
i
will
not
doubt
mr
pringle's
honour
so
much
as
to
believe
it
possible
i'm
d----d
said
jack
if
you
ain't
a
trump-card
and
no
mistake
it's
a
great
pity
as
you
is
a
wamphigher
the
time
mr
chillingworth
to-morrow
at
seven
o'clock
replied
that
gentleman
the
place
sir
the
best
place
that
i
can
think
of
is
a
level
meadow
half-way
between
here
and
bannerworth
hall
but
that
is
your
privilege
sir
francis
varney
i
waive
it
and
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
choice
of
the
spot
it
seems
of
the
best
character
imaginable
i
will
be
punctual
i
think
we
have
nothing
further
to
arrange
now
said
mr
chillingworth
you
will
meet
with
admiral
bell
certainly
i
believe
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
this
affair
is
very
satisfactorily
arranged
and
much
better
than
i
anticipated
good
morning
sir
francis
said
mr
chillingworth
good
morning
adieu
said
sir
francis
with
a
courteous
salutation
good
day
mr
pringle
and
commend
me
to
the
admiral
whose
services
will
be
of
infinite
value
to
me
don't
mention
it
said
jack
the
admiral's
the
man
as'd
lend
any
body
a
helping
hand
in
case
of
distress
like
the
present
and
i'll
pledge
my
word--jack
pringle's
too
as
that
he'll
do
what's
right
and
give
up
his
turn
to
mr
henry
bannerworth
cause
you
see
he
can
have
his
turn
arterwards
you
know--it's
only
waiting
awhile
that's
all
said
sir
francis
jack
pringle
made
a
sea
bow
and
took
his
leave
as
he
followed
mr
chillingworth
and
they
both
left
the
house
together
to
return
to
bannerworth
hall
well
said
mr
chillingworth
i
am
glad
that
sir
francis
varney
has
got
over
the
difficulty
of
having
no
seconds
for
it
would
not
be
proper
or
safe
to
meet
a
man
without
a
friend
for
him
it
ain't
the
right
thing
said
jack
hitching
up
his
trousers
but
i
was
afeard
as
how
he
would
back
out
and
that
would
be
just
the
wrong
thing
for
the
admiral
he'd
go
raving
mad
they
had
got
but
very
few
paces
from
sir
francis
varney's
house
when
they
were
joined
by
marchdale
ah
he
said
as
he
came
up
i
see
you
have
been
to
sir
francis
varney's
if
i
may
judge
from
the
direction
whence
you're
coming
and
your
proximity
yes
we
have
said
mr
chillingworth
i
thought
you
had
left
these
parts
i
had
intended
to
do
so
replied
marchdale
but
second
thoughts
are
sometimes
best
you
know
certainly
i
have
so
much
friendship
for
the
family
at
the
hall
that
notwithstanding
i
am
compelled
to
be
absent
from
the
mansion
itself
yet
i
cannot
quit
the
neighbourhood
while
there
are
circumstances
of
such
a
character
hanging
about
them
i
will
remain
and
see
if
there
be
not
something
arising
in
which
i
may
be
useful
to
them
in
some
matter
it
is
very
disinterested
of
you
you
will
remain
here
for
some
time
i
suppose
yes
undoubtedly
unless
as
i
do
not
anticipate
i
should
see
any
occasion
to
quit
my
present
quarters
i
tell
you
what
it
is
said
jack
pringle
if
you
had
been
here
half-an-hour
earlier
you
could
have
seconded
the
wamphigher
seconded
yes
we're
here
to
challenge
a
double
challenge
yes
but
in
confiding
this
matter
to
you
mr
marchdale
you
will
make
no
use
of
it
to
the
exploding
of
this
affair
by
so
doing
you
will
seriously
damage
the
honour
of
mr
henry
bannerworth
i
will
not
you
may
rely
upon
it
but
mr
chillingworth
do
i
not
see
you
in
the
character
of
a
second
you
do
sir
to
mr
henry
the
same
sir
have
you
reflected
upon
the
probable
consequences
of
such
an
act
should
any
serious
mischief
occur
what
i
have
undertaken
mr
marchdale
i
will
go
through
with
the
consequences
i
have
duly
considered
and
yet
you
see
me
in
the
character
of
mr
henry
bannerworth's
friend
i
am
happy
to
see
you
as
such
and
i
do
not
think
henry
could
find
a
better
but
this
is
beside
the
question
what
induced
me
to
make
the
remark
was
this--had
i
been
at
the
hall
you
will
admit
that
henry
bannerworth
would
have
chosen
myself
without
any
disparagement
to
you
mr
chillingworth
well
sir
what
then
why
i
am
a
single
man
i
can
live
reside
and
go
any
where
one
country
will
suit
me
as
well
as
another
i
shall
suffer
no
loss
but
as
for
you
you
will
be
ruined
in
every
particular
for
if
you
go
in
the
character
of
a
second
you
will
not
be
excused
for
all
the
penalties
incurred
your
profession
of
a
surgeon
will
not
excuse
you
i
see
all
that
sir
what
i
propose
is
that
you
should
accompany
the
parties
to
the
field
but
in
your
own
proper
character
of
surgeon
and
permit
me
to
take
that
of
second
to
mr
bannerworth
this
cannot
be
done
unless
by
mr
henry
bannerworth's
consent
said
mr
chillingworth
then
i
will
accompany
you
to
bannerworth
hall
and
see
mr
henry
whom
i
will
request
to
permit
me
to
do
what
i
have
mentioned
to
you
mr
chillingworth
could
not
but
admit
the
reasonableness
of
this
proposal
and
it
was
agreed
they
should
return
to
bannerworth
hall
in
company
here
they
arrived
in
a
very
short
time
after
and
entered
together
and
now
said
mr
chillingworth
i
will
go
and
bring
our
two
principals
who
will
be
as
much
astonished
to
find
themselves
engaged
in
the
same
quarrel
as
i
was
to
find
myself
sent
on
a
similar
errand
to
sir
francis
with
our
friend
mr
john
pringle
oh
not
john--jack
pringle
you
mean
said
that
individual
chillingworth
now
went
in
search
of
henry
and
sent
him
to
the
apartment
where
mr
marchdale
was
with
jack
pringle
and
then
he
found
the
admiral
waiting
the
return
of
jack
with
impatience
admiral
he
said
i
perceive
you
are
unwell
this
morning
unwell
be
d----d
said
the
admiral
starting
up
with
surprise
who
ever
heard
that
old
admiral
bell
looked
ill
just
afore
he
was
going
into
action
i
say
it's
a
scandalous
lie
admiral
admiral
i
didn't
say
you
were
ill
only
you
looked
ill--a--a
little
nervous
or
so
rather
pale
eh
is
it
not
so
confound
you
do
you
think
i
want
to
be
physicked
i
tell
you
i
have
not
a
little
but
a
great
inclination
to
give
you
a
good
keelhauling
i
don't
want
a
doctor
just
yet
but
it
may
not
be
so
long
you
know
admiral
but
there
is
jack
pringle
a-waiting
you
below
will
you
go
to
him
there
is
a
particular
reason
he
has
something
to
communicate
from
sir
francis
varney
i
believe
the
admiral
gave
a
look
of
some
amazement
at
mr
chillingworth
and
then
he
said
muttering
to
himself--
if
jack
pringle
should
have
betrayed
me--but
no
he
could
not
do
that
he
is
too
true
i'm
sure
of
jack
and
how
did
that
son
of
a
gallipot
hint
about
the
odd
fish
i
sent
jack
to
filled
with
a
dubious
kind
of
belief
which
he
had
about
something
he
had
heard
of
jack
pringle
he
entered
the
room
where
he
met
marchdale
jack
pringle
and
henry
bannerworth
immediately
afterwards
mr
chillingworth
entered
the
apartment
i
have
said
he
been
to
sir
francis
varney
and
there
had
an
interview
with
him
and
with
mr
pringle
when
i
found
we
were
both
intent
upon
the
same
object
namely
an
encounter
with
the
knight
by
our
principals
eh
said
the
admiral
what
exclaimed
henry
had
he
challenged
you
admiral
challenged
me
exclaimed
admiral
bell
with
a
round
oath
i--however--since
it
comes
to
this
i
must
admit
i
challenged
him
that's
what
i
did
said
henry
bannerworth
after
a
moment's
thought
and
i
perceive
we
have
both
fallen
into
the
same
line
of
conduct
that
is
the
fact
said
mr
chillingworth
both
mr
pringle
and
i
went
there
to
settle
the
preliminaries
and
we
found
an
insurmountable
bar
to
any
meeting
taking
place
at
all
he
wouldn't
fight
then
exclaimed
henry
i
see
it
all
now
not
fight
said
admiral
bell
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
disappointment
d--n
the
cowardly
rascal
tell
me
jack
pringle
what
did
the
long
horse-marine-looking
slab
say
to
it
he
told
me
he
would
fight
why
he
ought
to
be
made
to
stand
sentry
over
the
wind
you
challenged
him
in
person
too
i
suppose
said
henry
yes
confound
him
i
went
there
last
night
and
i
too
it
seems
to
me
said
marchdale
that
this
affair
has
been
not
indiscretely
conducted
but
somewhat
unusually
and
strangely
to
say
the
least
of
it
you
see
said
chillingworth
sir
francis
was
willing
to
fight
both
henry
and
the
admiral
as
he
told
us
yes
said
jack
he
told
us
he
would
fight
us
both
if
so
be
as
his
light
was
not
doused
in
the
first
brush
that
was
all
that
was
wanted
said
the
admiral
we
could
expect
no
more
but
then
he
desired
to
meet
you
without
any
second
but
of
course
i
would
not
accede
to
this
proposal
the
responsibility
was
too
great
and
too
unequally
borne
by
the
parties
engaged
in
the
rencontre
decidedly
said
henry
but
it
is
unfortunate--very
unfortunate
very
said
the
admiral--very
what
a
rascally
thing
it
is
there
ain't
another
rogue
in
the
country
to
keep
him
in
countenance
illustration
i
thought
it
was
a
pity
to
spoil
sport
said
jack
pringle
it
was
a
pity
a
good
intention
should
be
spoiled
and
i
promised
the
wamphigher
that
if
as
how
he
would
fight
you
should
second
him
and
you'd
meet
him
to
do
so
eh
who
i
exclaimed
the
admiral
in
some
perplexity
yes
that
is
the
truth
said
mr
chillingworth
mr
pringle
said
you
would
do
so
and
he
then
and
there
pledged
his
word
that
you
should
meet
him
on
the
ground
and
second
him
yes
said
jack
you
must
do
it
i
knew
you
would
not
spoil
sport
and
that
there
had
better
be
a
fight
than
no
fight
i
believe
you'd
sooner
see
a
scrimmage
than
none
and
so
it's
all
arranged
very
well
said
the
admiral
i
only
wish
mr
henry
bannerworth
had
been
his
second
i
think
i
was
entitled
to
the
first
meeting
no
said
jack
you
warn't
for
mr
chillingworth
was
there
first
first
come
first
served
you
know
well
well
i
mustn't
grumble
at
another
man's
luck
mine'll
come
in
turn
but
it
had
better
be
so
than
a
disappointment
altogether
i'll
be
second
to
this
sir
francis
varney
he
shall
have
fair
play
as
i'm
an
admiral
but
d----e
he
shall
fight--yes
yes
he
shall
fight
and
to
this
conclusion
i
would
come
said
henry
i
wish
him
to
fight
now
i
will
take
care
that
he
shall
not
have
any
opportunity
of
putting
me
on
one
side
quietly
there
is
one
thing
observed
marchdale
that
i
wished
to
propose
after
what
has
passed
i
should
not
have
returned
had
i
not
some
presentiment
that
something
was
going
forward
in
which
i
could
be
useful
to
my
friend
oh
said
the
admiral
with
a
huge
twist
of
his
countenance
what
i
was
about
to
say
was
this--mr
chillingworth
has
much
to
lose
as
he
is
situated
and
i
nothing
as
i
am
placed
i
am
chained
down
to
no
spot
of
earth
i
am
above
following
a
profession--my
means
i
mean
place
me
above
the
necessity
now
henry
allow
me
to
be
your
second
in
this
affair
allow
mr
chillingworth
to
attend
in
his
professional
capacity
he
may
be
of
service--of
great
service
to
one
of
the
principals
whereas
if
he
go
in
any
other
capacity
he
will
inevitably
have
his
own
safety
to
consult
that
is
most
unquestionably
true
said
henry
and
to
my
mind
the
best
plan
that
can
be
proposed
what
say
you
admiral
bell
will
you
act
with
mr
marchdale
in
this
affair
oh
i--yes--certainly--i
don't
care
mr
marchdale
is
mr
marchdale
i
believe
and
that's
all
i
care
about
if
we
quarrel
to-day
and
have
anything
to
do
to-morrow
in
course
to-morrow
i
can
put
off
my
quarrel
for
next
day
it
will
keep--that's
all
i
have
to
say
at
present
then
this
is
a
final
arrangement
said
mr
chillingworth
it
is
but
mr
bannerworth
in
resigning
my
character
of
second
to
mr
marchdale
i
only
do
so
because
it
appears
and
seems
to
be
the
opinion
of
all
present
that
i
can
be
much
better
employed
in
another
capacity
certainly
mr
chillingworth
and
i
cannot
but
feel
that
i
am
under
the
same
obligations
to
you
for
the
readiness
and
zeal
with
which
you
have
acted
i
have
done
what
i
have
done
said
chillingworth
because
i
believed
it
was
my
duty
to
do
so
mr
chillingworth
has
undoubtedly
acted
most
friendly
and
efficiently
in
this
affair
said
marchdale
and
he
does
not
relinquish
the
part
for
the
purpose
of
escaping
a
friendly
deed
but
to
perform
one
in
which
he
may
act
in
a
capacity
that
no
one
else
can
that
is
true
said
the
admiral
and
now
said
chillingworth
you
are
to
meet
to-morrow
morning
in
the
meadow
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
half
way
between
here
and
sir
francis
varney's
house
at
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
more
conversation
passed
among
them
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
meet
early
the
next
morning
and
that
of
course
the
affair
should
be
kept
a
secret
marchdale
for
that
night
should
remain
in
the
house
and
the
admiral
should
appear
as
if
little
or
nothing
was
the
matter
and
he
and
jack
pringle
retired
to
talk
over
in
private
all
the
arrangements
henry
bannerworth
and
marchdale
also
retired
and
mr
chillingworth
after
a
time
retired
promising
to
be
with
them
in
time
for
the
meeting
next
morning
much
of
that
day
was
spent
by
henry
bannerworth
in
his
own
apartment
in
writing
documents
and
letters
of
one
kind
and
another
but
at
night
he
had
not
finished
for
he
had
been
compelled
to
be
about
and
in
flora's
presence
to
prevent
anything
from
being
suspected
marchdale
was
much
with
him
and
in
secret
examined
the
arms
ammunition
and
bullets
and
saw
all
was
right
for
the
next
morning
and
when
he
had
done
he
said--
now
henry
you
must
permit
me
to
insist
that
you
take
some
hours'
repose
else
you
will
scarcely
be
as
you
ought
to
be
very
good
said
henry
i
have
just
finished
and
can
take
your
advice
after
many
thoughts
and
reflections
henry
bannerworth
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
slept
several
hours
in
calmness
and
quietude
and
at
an
early
hour
he
awoke
and
saw
marchdale
sitting
by
him
is
it
time
marchdale
i
have
not
overslept
myself
have
i
no
time
enough--time
enough
said
marchdale
i
should
have
let
you
sleep
longer
but
i
should
have
awakened
you
in
good
time
it
was
now
the
grey
light
of
morning
and
henry
arose
and
began
to
prepare
for
the
encounter
marchdale
stole
to
admiral
bell's
chamber
but
he
and
jack
pringle
were
ready
few
words
were
spoken
and
those
few
were
in
a
whisper
and
the
whole
party
left
the
hall
in
as
noiseless
a
manner
as
possible
it
was
a
mild
morning
and
yet
it
was
cold
at
that
time
of
the
morning
just
as
day
is
beginning
to
dawn
in
the
east
there
was
however
ample
time
to
reach
the
rendezvous
it
was
a
curious
party
that
which
was
now
proceeding
towards
the
spot
appointed
for
the
duel
the
result
of
which
might
have
so
important
an
effect
on
the
interests
of
those
who
were
to
be
engaged
in
it
it
would
be
difficult
for
us
to
analyse
the
different
and
conflicting
emotions
that
filled
the
breasts
of
the
various
individuals
composing
that
party--the
hopes
and
fears--the
doubts
and
surmises
that
were
given
utterance
to
though
we
are
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
though
to
henry
the
character
of
the
man
he
was
going
to
meet
in
mortal
fight
was
of
a
most
ambiguous
and
undefined
nature
and
though
no
one
could
imagine
the
means
he
might
be
endowed
with
for
protection
against
the
arms
of
man--henry
as
we
said
strode
firmly
forward
with
unflinching
resolution
his
heart
was
set
on
recovering
the
happiness
of
his
sister
and
he
would
not
falter
so
far
then
we
may
consider
that
at
length
proceedings
of
a
hostile
character
were
so
far
clearly
and
fairly
arranged
between
henry
bannerworth
and
that
most
mysterious
being
who
certainly
from
some
cause
or
another
had
betrayed
no
inclination
to
meet
an
opponent
in
that
manner
which
is
sanctioned
bad
as
it
is
by
the
usages
of
society
but
whether
his
motive
was
one
of
cowardice
or
mercy
remained
yet
to
be
seen
it
might
be
that
he
feared
himself
receiving
some
mortal
injury
which
would
at
once
put
a
stop
to
that
preternatural
career
of
existence
which
he
affected
to
shudder
at
and
yet
evidently
took
considerable
pains
to
prolong
upon
the
other
hand
it
is
just
possible
that
some
consciousness
of
invulnerability
on
his
own
part
or
of
great
power
to
injure
his
antagonist
might
be
the
cause
why
he
had
held
back
so
long
from
fighting
the
duel
and
placed
so
many
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
usual
necessary
arrangements
incidental
to
such
occasions
now
however
there
would
seem
to
be
no
possible
means
of
escape
sir
francis
varney
must
fight
or
fly
for
he
was
surrounded
by
too
many
opponents
to
be
sure
he
might
have
appealed
to
the
civil
authorities
to
protect
him
and
to
sanction
him
in
his
refusal
to
commit
what
undoubtedly
is
a
legal
offence
but
then
there
cannot
be
a
question
that
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
would
come
out
and
meet
the
public
eye--the
result
of
which
would
be
his
acquisition
of
a
reputation
as
unenviable
as
it
would
be
universal
it
had
so
happened
that
the
peculiar
position
of
the
bannerworth
family
kept
their
acquaintance
within
extremely
narrow
limits
and
greatly
indisposed
them
to
set
themselves
up
as
marks
for
peculiar
observation
once
holding
as
they
had
a
proud
position
in
the
county
and
being
looked
upon
quite
as
magnates
of
the
land
they
did
not
now
court
the
prying
eye
of
curiosity
to
look
upon
their
poverty
but
rather
with
a
gloomy
melancholy
they
lived
apart
and
repelled
the
advances
of
society
by
a
cold
reserve
which
few
could
break
through
had
this
family
suffered
in
any
noble
cause
or
had
the
misfortunes
which
had
come
over
them
and
robbed
their
ancestral
house
of
its
lustre
been
an
unavoidable
dispensation
of
providence
they
would
have
borne
the
hard
position
with
a
different
aspect
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
to
the
faults
the
vices
and
the
criminality
of
some
of
their
race
was
to
be
attributed
their
present
depressed
state
it
has
been
seen
during
the
progress
of
our
tale
that
its
action
has
been
tolerably
confined
to
bannerworth
hall
its
adjacent
meadows
and
the
seat
of
sir
francis
varney
the
only
person
at
any
distance
knowing
anything
of
the
circumstances
or
feeling
any
interest
in
them
being
mr
chillingworth
the
surgeon
who
from
personal
feeling
as
well
as
from
professional
habit
was
not
likely
to
make
a
family's
affairs
a
subject
of
gossip
a
change
however
was
at
hand--a
change
of
a
most
startling
and
alarming
character
to
varney--one
which
he
might
expect
yet
not
be
well
prepared
for
this
period
of
serenity
was
to
pass
away
and
he
was
to
become
most
alarmingly
popular
we
will
not
however
anticipate
but
proceed
at
once
to
detail
as
briefly
as
may
be
the
hostile
meeting
it
would
appear
that
varney
now
that
he
had
once
consented
to
the
definitive
arrangements
of
a
duel
shrunk
not
in
any
way
from
carrying
them
out
nor
in
the
slightest
attempted
to
retard
arrangements
which
might
be
fatal
to
himself
the
early
morning
was
one
of
those
cloudy
ones
so
frequently
occurring
in
our
fickle
climate
when
the
cleverest
weather
prophet
would
find
it
difficult
to
predict
what
the
next
hour
might
produce
there
was
a
kind
of
dim
gloominess
over
all
objects
and
as
there
were
no
bright
lights
there
were
no
deep
shadows--the
consequence
of
which
was
a
sureness
of
effect
over
the
landscape
that
robbed
it
of
many
of
its
usual
beauties
such
was
the
state
of
things
when
marchdale
accompanied
henry
and
admiral
bell
from
bannerworth
hall
across
the
garden
in
the
direction
of
the
hilly
wood
close
to
which
was
the
spot
intended
for
the
scene
of
encounter
jack
pringle
came
on
at
a
lazy
pace
behind
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
looking
as
unconcerned
as
if
he
had
just
come
out
for
a
morning's
stroll
and
scarcely
knew
whether
he
saw
what
was
going
on
or
not
the
curious
contortion
into
which
he
twisted
his
countenance
and
the
different
odd-looking
lumps
that
appeared
in
it
from
time
to
time
may
be
accounted
for
by
a
quid
of
unusual
size
which
he
seemed
to
be
masticating
with
a
relish
quite
horrifying
to
one
unused
to
so
barbarous
a
luxury
the
admiral
had
strictly
enjoined
him
not
to
interfere
on
pain
of
being
considered
a
lubber
and
no
seaman
for
the
remainder
of
his
existence--threatened
penalties
which
of
course
had
their
own
weight
with
jack
and
accordingly
he
came
just
to
see
the
row
in
as
quiet
a
way
as
possible
perhaps
not
without
a
hope
that
something
might
turn
up
in
the
shape
of
a
causus
belli
that
might
justify
him
in
adopting
a
threatening
attitude
towards
somebody
now
master
henry
said
the
admiral
none
of
your
palaver
to
me
as
we
go
along
recollect
i
don't
belong
to
your
party
you
know
i've
stood
friend
to
two
or
three
fellows
in
my
time
but
if
anybody
had
said
to
me
'admiral
bell
the
next
time
you
go
out
on
a
quiet
little
shooting
party
it
will
be
as
second
to
a
vampyre'
i'd
have
said
'you're
a
liar'
howsomever
d--me
here
you
goes
and
what
i
mean
to
say
is
this
mr
henry
that
i'd
second
even
a
frenchman
rather
than
he
shouldn't
fight
when
he's
asked
that's
liberal
of
you
said
henry
at
all
event
i
believe
you
it
is
said
the
admiral
so
mind
if
you
don't
hit
him
i'm
not
a-going
to
tell
you
how--all
you've
got
to
do
is
to
fire
low
but
that's
no
business
of
mine
shiver
my
timbers
i
oughtn't
to
tell
you
but
d--n
you
hit
him
if
you
can
admiral
said
henry
i
can
hardly
think
you
are
even
preserving
a
neutrality
in
the
matter
putting
aside
my
own
partisanship
as
regards
your
own
man
oh
hang
him
i'm
not
going
to
let
him
creep
out
of
the
thing
on
such
a
shabby
pretence
i
can
tell
you
i
think
i
ought
to
have
gone
to
his
house
this
morning
only
as
i
said
i
never
would
cross
his
threshold
again
i
won't
i
wonder
if
he'll
come
said
mr
marchdale
to
henry
after
all
you
know
he
may
take
to
flight
and
shun
an
encounter
which
it
is
evident
he
has
entered
into
but
tardily
i
hope
not
said
henry
and
yet
i
must
own
that
your
supposition
has
several
times
crossed
my
mind
if
however
he
do
not
meet
me
he
never
can
appear
at
all
in
the
country
and
we
should
at
least
be
rid
of
him
and
all
his
troublesome
importunities
concerning
the
hall
i
would
not
allow
that
man
on
any
account
to
cross
the
threshold
of
my
house
as
its
tenant
or
its
owner
why
it
ain't
usual
said
the
admiral
to
let
ones
house
to
two
people
at
once
unless
you
seem
quite
to
forget
that
i've
taken
yours
i
may
as
well
remind
you
of
it
hurra
said
jack
pringle
at
this
moment
what's
the
matter
with
you
who
told
you
to
hurra
enemy
in
the
offing
said
jack
three
or
four
pints
to
the
sou-west
so
he
is
by
jove
dodging
about
among
the
trees
come
now
this
vampyre's
a
decenter
fellow
than
i
thought
him
he
means
after
all
to
let
us
have
a
pop
at
him
they
had
now
reached
so
close
to
the
spot
that
sir
francis
varney
who
to
all
appearance
had
been
waiting
emerged
from
among
the
trees
rolled
up
in
his
dismal-looking
cloak
and
if
possible
looking
longer
and
thinner
than
ever
he
had
looked
before
his
face
wore
a
singular
cadaverous
looking
aspect
his
very
lips
were
white
and
there
was
a
curious
pinkish-looking
circle
round
each
of
his
eyes
that
imparted
to
his
whole
countenance
a
most
uninviting
appearance
he
turned
his
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
of
those
who
were
advancing
towards
him
until
he
saw
the
admiral
upon
which
he
gave
such
a
grim
and
horrible
smile
that
the
old
man
exclaimed--
i
say
jack
you
lubber
there's
a
face
for
a
figure
head
ay
ay
sir
did
you
ever
see
such
a
d----d
grin
as
that
in
your
life
in
any
latitude
ay
ay
sir
you
did
you
swab
i
should
think
so
it's
a
lie
and
you
know
it
very
good
said
jack
don't
you
recollect
when
that
ere
iron
bullet
walked
over
your
head
leaving
a
nice
little
nick
all
the
way
off
bergen-ap-zoom
that
was
the
time--blessed
if
you
didn't
give
just
such
a
grin
as
that
i
didn't
you
rascal
and
i
say
you
did
mutiny
by
god
go
to
blazes
how
far
this
contention
might
have
gone
having
now
reached
its
culminating
point
had
the
admiral
and
jack
been
alone
it
is
hard
to
say
but
as
it
was
henry
and
marchdale
interfered
and
so
the
quarrel
was
patched
up
for
the
moment
in
order
to
give
place
to
more
important
affairs
varney
seemed
to
think
that
after
the
smiling
welcome
he
had
given
to
his
second
he
had
done
quite
enough
for
there
he
stood
tall
and
gaunt
and
motionless
if
we
may
except
an
occasional
singular
movement
of
the
mouth
and
a
clap
together
of
his
teeth
at
times
which
was
enough
to
make
anybody
jump
to
hear
for
heaven's
sake
said
marchdale
do
not
let
us
trifle
at
such
a
moment
as
this
mr
pringle
you
really
had
no
business
here
mr
who
said
jack
pringle
i
believe
is
your
name
returned
marchdale
it
were
but
blowed
if
ever
i
was
called
mister
before
the
admiral
walked
up
to
sir
francis
varney
and
gave
him
a
nod
that
looked
much
more
like
one
of
defiance
than
of
salutation
to
which
the
vampyre
replied
by
a
low
courtly
bow
oh
bother
muttered
the
old
admiral
if
i
was
to
double
up
my
backbone
like
that
i
should
never
get
it
down
straight
again
well
all's
right
you've
come
that's
all
you
could
do
i
suppose
i
am
here
said
varney
and
therefore
it
becomes
a
work
of
supererogation
to
remark
that
i've
come
oh
does
it
i
never
bolted
a
dictionary
and
therefore
i
don't
know
exactly
what
you
mean
step
aside
with
me
a
moment
admiral
bell
and
i
will
tell
you
what
you
are
to
do
with
me
after
i
am
shot
if
such
should
be
my
fate
do
with
you
d----d
if
i'll
do
anything
with
you
i
don't
expect
you
will
regret
me
you
will
eat
eat
yes
and
drink
as
usual
no
doubt
notwithstanding
being
witness
to
the
decease
of
a
fellow-creature
belay
there
don't
call
yourself
a
fellow-creature
of
mine
i
ain't
a
vampyre
but
there's
no
knowing
what
you
may
be
and
now
listen
to
my
instructions
for
as
you're
my
second
you
cannot
very
well
refuse
to
me
a
few
friendly
offices
rain
is
falling
step
beneath
this
ancient
tree
and
i
will
talk
to
you
the
storm
and
the
fight-the
admiral's
repudiation
of
his
principal
illustration
well
said
the
admiral
when
they
were
fairly
under
the
tree
upon
the
leaves
of
which
the
pattering
rain
might
be
heard
falling
well--what
is
it
if
your
young
friend
mr
bannerworth
should
chance
to
send
a
pistol-bullet
through
any
portion
of
my
anatomy
prejudicial
to
the
prolongation
of
my
existence
you
will
be
so
good
as
not
to
interfere
with
anything
i
may
have
about
me
or
to
make
any
disturbance
whatever
you
may
depend
i
sha'n't
just
take
the
matter
perfectly
easy--as
a
thing
of
course
oh
i
mean
d----d
easy
ha
what
a
delightful
thing
is
friendship
there
is
a
little
knoll
or
mound
of
earth
midway
between
here
and
the
hall
do
you
happen
to
know
it
there
is
one
solitary
tree
glowing
near
its
summit--an
oriental
looking
tree
of
the
fir
tribe
which
fan-like
spreads
its
deep
green
leaves
across
the
azure
sky
oh
bother
it
it's
a
d----d
old
tree
growing
upon
a
little
bit
of
a
hill
i
suppose
you
mean
precisely
only
much
more
poetically
expressed
the
moon
rises
at
a
quarter
past
four
to-night
or
rather
to-morrow
morning
does
it
yes
and
if
i
should
happen
to
be
killed
you
will
have
me
removed
gently
to
this
mound
of
earth
and
there
laid
beneath
this
tree
with
my
face
upwards
and
take
care
that
it
is
done
before
the
moon
rises
you
can
watch
that
no
one
interferes
a
likely
job
what
the
deuce
do
you
take
me
for
i
tell
you
what
it
is
mr
vampyre
or
varney
or
whatever's
your
name
if
you
should
chance
to
be
hit
where-ever
you
chance
to
fall
there
you'll
lie
how
very
unkind
uncommon
ain't
it
well
well
since
that
is
your
determination
i
must
take
care
of
myself
in
another
way
i
can
do
so
and
i
will
take
care
of
yourself
how
you
like
for
all
i
care
i've
come
here
to
second
you
and
to
see
that
on
the
honour
of
a
seaman
if
you
are
put
out
of
the
world
it's
done
in
a
proper
manner
that's
all
i
have
to
do
with
you--now
you
know
sir
francis
varney
looked
after
him
with
a
strange
kind
of
smile
as
he
walked
away
to
make
the
necessary
preparation
with
marchdale
for
the
immediate
commencement
of
the
contest
these
were
simple
and
brief
it
was
agreed
that
twelve
paces
should
be
measured
out
six
each
way
from
a
fixed
point
one
six
to
be
paced
by
the
admiral
and
the
other
by
marchdale
then
they
were
to
draw
lots
to
see
at
which
end
of
this
imaginary
line
varney
was
to
be
placed
after
this
the
signal
for
firing
was
to
be
one
two
three--fire
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
complete
these
arrangements
the
ground
was
measured
in
the
manner
we
have
stated
and
the
combatants
placed
in
their
respective
positions
sir
francis
varney
occupying
the
same
spot
where
he
had
at
first
stood
namely
that
nearest
to
the
little
wood
and
to
his
own
residence
it
is
impossible
that
under
such
circumstances
the
bravest
and
the
calmest
of
mankind
could
fail
to
feel
some
slight
degree
of
tremour
or
uneasiness
and
although
we
can
fairly
claim
for
henry
bannerworth
that
he
was
as
truly
courageous
as
any
right
feeling
christian
man
could
wish
to
be
yet
when
it
was
possible
that
he
stood
within
as
it
were
a
hair's
breadth
of
eternity
a
strange
world
of
sensation
and
emotions
found
a
home
in
his
heart
and
he
could
not
look
altogether
undaunted
on
that
future
which
might
for
all
he
knew
to
the
contrary
be
so
close
at
hand
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
it
was
not
that
he
feared
death
but
that
he
looked
with
a
decent
gravity
upon
so
grave
a
change
as
that
from
this
world
to
the
next
and
hence
was
it
that
his
face
was
pale
and
that
he
looked
all
the
emotion
which
he
really
felt
this
was
the
aspect
and
the
bearing
of
a
brave
but
not
a
reckless
man
while
sir
francis
varney
on
the
other
hand
seemed
now
that
he
had
fairly
engaged
in
the
duel
to
look
upon
it
and
its
attendant
circumstances
with
a
kind
of
smirking
satisfaction
as
if
he
were
far
more
amused
than
personally
interested
this
was
certainly
the
more
extraordinary
after
the
manner
in
which
he
had
tried
to
evade
the
fight
and
at
all
events
was
quite
a
sufficient
proof
that
cowardice
had
not
been
his
actuating
motive
in
so
doing
the
admiral
who
stood
on
a
level
with
him
could
not
see
the
sort
of
expression
he
wore
or
probably
he
would
have
been
far
from
well
pleased
but
the
others
did
and
they
found
something
inexpressibly
disagreeable
in
the
smirking
kind
of
satisfaction
with
which
the
vampyre
seemed
to
regard
now
the
proceedings
confound
him
whispered
marchdale
to
henry
one
would
think
he
was
quite
delighted
instead
as
we
had
imagined
him
not
well
pleased
at
these
proceedings
look
how
he
grins
it
is
no
matter
said
henry
let
him
wear
what
aspect
he
may
it
is
the
same
to
me
and
as
heaven
is
my
judge
i
here
declare
if
i
did
not
think
myself
justified
in
so
doing
i
would
not
raise
my
hand
against
this
man
there
can
be
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
regarding
your
justification
have
at
him
and
heaven
protect
you
amen
the
admiral
was
to
give
the
word
to
fire
and
now
he
and
marshal
having
stepped
sufficiently
on
one
side
to
be
out
of
all
possible
danger
from
any
stray
shot
he
commenced
repeating
the
signal--
are
you
ready
gentlemen--once
they
looked
sternly
at
each
other
and
each
grasped
his
pistol
twice
sir
francis
varney
smiled
and
looked
around
him
as
if
the
affair
were
one
of
the
most
common-place
description
thrice
varney
seemed
to
be
studying
the
sky
rather
than
attending
to
the
duel
fire
said
the
admiral
and
one
report
only
struck
upon
the
ear
it
was
that
from
henry's
pistol
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
sir
francis
varney
who
had
evidently
reserved
his
fire
for
what
purpose
could
not
be
devised
except
a
murderous
one
the
taking
of
a
more
steady
aim
at
henry
sir
francis
however
seemed
in
no
hurry
but
smiled
significantly
and
gradually
raised
the
point
of
his
weapon
did
you
hear
the
word
sir
francis
i
gave
it
loud
enough
i
am
sure
i
never
spoke
plainer
in
my
life
did
i
ever
jack
yes
often
said
jack
pringle
what's
the
use
of
your
asking
such
yarns
as
them
you
know
you
have
done
so
often
enough
when
you
wanted
grog
you
d----d
rascal
i'll--i'll
have
your
back
scored
i
will
so
you
will
when
you
are
afloat
again
which
you
never
will
be--you're
paid
off
that's
certain
you
lubberly
lout
you
ain't
a
seaman
a
seaman
would
never
mutiny
against
his
admiral
howsomever
do
you
hear
sir
francis
i'll
give
the
matter
up
if
you
don't
pay
some
attention
to
me
henry
looked
steadily
at
varney
expecting
every
moment
to
feel
his
bullet
mr
marchdale
hastily
exclaimed
that
this
was
not
according
to
usage
sir
francis
varney
took
no
notice
but
went
on
elevating
his
weapon
when
it
was
perpendicular
to
the
earth
he
fired
in
the
air
i
had
not
anticipated
this
said
marchdale
as
he
walked
to
henry
i
thought
he
was
taking
a
more
deadly
aim
and
i
said
henry
ay
you
have
escaped
henry
let
me
congratulate
you
not
so
fast
we
may
fire
again
i
can
afford
to
do
that
he
said
with
a
smile
you
should
have
fired
sir
according
to
custom
said
the
admiral
this
is
not
the
proper
thing
what
fire
at
your
friend
oh
that's
all
very
well
you
are
my
friend
for
a
time
vampyre
as
you
are
and
i
intend
you
shall
fire
if
mr
henry
bannerworth
demands
another
fire
i
have
no
objection
to
it
and
will
fire
at
him
but
as
it
is
i
shall
not
do
so
indeed
it
would
be
quite
useless
for
him
to
do
so--to
point
mortal
weapons
at
me
is
mere
child's
play
they
will
not
hurt
me
the
devil
they
won't
said
the
admiral
why
look
you
here
said
sir
francis
varney
stepping
forward
and
placing
his
hand
to
his
neckerchief
look
you
here
if
mr
henry
bannerworth
should
demand
another
fire
he
may
do
so
with
the
same
bullet
the
same
bullet
said
marchdale
stepping
forward--the
same
bullet
how
is
this
my
eyes
said
jack
who'd
a
thought
it
there's
a
go
wouldn't
he
do
for
a
dummy--to
lead
a
forlorn
hope
or
to
put
among
the
boarders
here
said
sir
francis
handing
a
bullet
to
henry
bannerworth--here
is
the
bullet
you
shot
at
me
henry
looked
at
it--it
was
blackened
by
powder
and
then
marchdale
seized
it
and
tried
it
in
the
pistol
but
found
the
bullet
fitted
henry's
weapon
by
heavens
it
is
so
he
exclaimed
stepping
back
and
looking
at
varney
from
top
to
toe
in
horror
and
amazement
d----e
said
the
admiral
if
i
understand
this
why
jack
pringle
you
dog
here's
a
strange
fish
on
no
there's
plenty
on
'um
in
some
countries
will
you
insist
upon
another
fire
or
may
i
consider
you
satisfied
i
shall
object
said
marchdale
henry
this
affair
must
go
no
further
it
would
be
madness--worse
than
madness
to
fight
upon
such
terms
so
say
i
said
the
admiral
i
will
not
have
anything
to
do
with
you
sir
francis
i'll
not
be
your
second
any
longer
i
didn't
bargain
for
such
a
game
as
this
you
might
as
well
fight
with
the
man
in
brass
armour
at
the
lord
mayor's
show
or
the
champion
at
a
coronation
oh
said
jack
pringle
a
man
may
as
well
fire
at
the
back
of
a
halligator
as
a
wamphigher
this
must
be
considered
as
having
been
concluded
said
mr
marchdale
no
said
henry
and
wherefore
not
because
i
have
not
received
his
fire
heaven
forbid
you
should
i
may
not
with
honour
quit
the
ground
without
another
fire
under
ordinary
circumstances
there
might
be
some
shadow
of
an
excuse
for
your
demand
but
as
it
is
there
is
none
you
have
neither
honour
nor
credit
to
gain
by
such
an
encounter
and
certainly
you
can
gain
no
object
how
are
we
to
decide
this
affair
am
i
considered
absolved
from
the
accusation
under
which
i
lay
of
cowardice
inquired
sir
francis
varney
with
a
cold
smile
why
as
for
that
said
the
admiral
i
should
as
soon
expect
credit
for
fighting
behind
a
wall
as
with
a
man
that
i
couldn't
hit
any
more
than
the
moon
henry
let
me
implore
you
to
quit
this
scene
it
can
do
no
good
at
this
moment
a
noise
as
of
human
voices
was
heard
at
a
distance
this
caused
a
momentary
pause
and
the
whole
party
stood
still
and
listened
the
murmurs
and
shouts
that
now
arose
in
the
distance
were
indistinct
and
confused
what
can
all
this
mean
said
marchdale
there
is
something
very
strange
about
it
i
cannot
imagine
a
cause
for
so
unusual
an
occurrence
nor
i
said
sir
francis
varney
looking
suspiciously
at
henry
bannerworth
upon
my
honour
i
know
neither
what
is
the
cause
nor
the
nature
of
the
sounds
themselves
then
we
can
easily
see
what
is
the
matter
from
yonder
hillock
said
the
admiral
and
there's
jack
pringle
he's
up
there
already
what's
he
telegraphing
about
in
that
manner
i
wonder
the
fact
was
jack
pringle
hearing
the
riot
had
thought
that
if
he
got
to
the
neighbouring
eminence
he
might
possibly
ascertain
what
it
was
that
was
the
cause
of
what
he
termed
the
row
and
had
succeeded
in
some
degree
there
were
a
number
of
people
of
all
kinds
coming
out
from
the
village
apparently
armed
and
shouting
jack
pringle
hitched
up
his
trousers
and
swore
then
took
off
his
hat
and
began
to
shout
to
the
admiral
as
he
said--
d----e
they
are
too
late
to
spoil
the
sport
hilloa
hurrah
what's
all
that
about
jack
inquired
the
admiral
as
he
came
puffing
along
what's
the
squall
about
only
a
few
horse-marines
and
bumboat-women
that
have
been
startled
like
a
company
of
penguins
oh
my
eyes
wouldn't
a
whole
broadside
set
'em
flying
jack
ay
just
as
them
frenchmen
that
you
murdered
on
board
the
big
thunderer
as
you
called
it
i
murder
them
you
rascal
yes
there
was
about
five
hundred
of
them
killed
they
were
only
shot
they
were
killed
only
your
conscience
tells
you
it's
uncomfortable
you
rascal--you
villain
you
ought
to
be
keel-hauled
and
well
payed
ay
you're
payed
and
paid
off
as
an
old
hulk
d----e--you--you--oh
i
wish
i
had
you
on
board
ship
i'd
make
your
lubberly
carcass
like
a
union
jack
full
of
red
and
blue
stripes
oh
it's
all
very
well
but
if
you
don't
take
to
your
heels
you'll
have
all
the
old
women
in
the
village
a
whacking
on
you
that's
all
i
have
to
say
about
it
you'd
better
port
your
helm
and
about
ship
or
you'll
be
keel-hauled
d--n
your--
what's
the
matter
inquired
marchdale
as
he
arrived
what's
the
cause
of
all
the
noise
we
have
heard
said
sir
francis
has
some
village
festival
spontaneously
burst
forth
among
the
rustics
of
this
place
i
cannot
tell
the
cause
of
it
said
henry
bannerworth
but
they
seem
to
me
to
be
coming
towards
this
place
indeed
i
think
so
too
said
marchdale
with
what
object
inquired
sir
francis
varney
no
peaceable
one
observed
henry
for
as
far
i
can
observe
they
struck
across
the
country
as
though
they
would
enclose
something
or
intercept
somebody
indeed
but
why
come
here
if
i
knew
that
i
could
have
at
once
told
the
cause
and
they
appear
armed
with
a
variety
of
odd
weapons
observed
sir
francis
they
mean
an
attack
upon
some
one
who
is
that
man
with
them
he
seems
to
be
deprecating
their
coming
that
appears
to
be
mr
chillingworth
said
henry
i
think
that
is
he
yes
observed
the
admiral
i
think
i
know
the
build
of
that
craft
he's
been
in
our
society
before
i
always
know
a
ship
as
soon
as
i
see
it
does
you
though
said
jack
yea
what
do
you
mean
eh
let
me
hear
what
you've
got
to
say
against
your
captain
and
your
admiral
you
mutinous
dog
you
tell
me
i
say
so
i
will
you
thought
you
were
fighting
a
big
ship
in
a
fog
and
fired
a
dozen
broadsides
or
so
and
it
was
only
the
flying
dutchman
or
the
devil
you
infernal
dog--
well
you
know
it
was
it
might
a
been
our
own
shadow
for
all
i
can
tell
indeed
i
think
it
was
you
think
yes
that's
mutiny
i'll
have
no
more
to
do
with
you
jack
pringle
you're
no
seaman
and
have
no
respect
for
your
officer
now
sheer
off
or
i'll
cut
your
yards
why
as
for
my
yards
i'll
square
'em
presently
if
i
like
you
old
swab
but
as
for
leaving
you
very
well
you
have
said
so
and
you
shall
be
accommodated
d----e
however
it
was
not
so
when
your
nob
was
nearly
rove
through
with
a
boarding
pike
it
wasn't
'i'll
have
no
more
to
do
with
jack
pringle'
then
it
was
more
t'other
well
then
why
be
so
mutinous
because
you
aggrawates
me
the
cries
of
the
mob
became
more
distinct
as
they
drew
nearer
to
the
party
who
began
to
evince
some
uneasiness
as
to
their
object
surely
said
marchdale
mr
chillingworth
has
not
named
anything
respecting
the
duel
that
has
taken
place
no
no
but
he
was
to
have
been
here
this
morning
said
the
admiral
i
understood
he
was
to
be
here
in
his
own
character
of
a
surgeon
and
yet
i
have
not
seen
him
have
any
of
you
no
said
henry
then
here
he
comes
in
the
character
of
conservator
of
the
public
peace
said
varney
coldly
however
i
believe
that
his
errand
will
be
useless
since
the
affair
is
i
presume
concluded
down
with
the
vampyre
eh
said
the
admiral
eh
what's
that
eh
what
did
they
say
if
you'll
listen
they'll
tell
you
soon
enough
i'll
warrant
may
be
they
will
and
yet
i'd
like
to
know
now
sir
francis
varney
looked
significantly
at
marchdale
and
then
waited
with
downcast
eyes
for
the
repetition
of
the
words
down
with
the
vampyre
resounded
on
all
sides
from
the
people
who
came
rapidly
towards
them
and
converging
towards
a
centre
burn
destroy
and
kill
the
vampyre
no
vampyre
burn
him
out
down
with
him
kill
him
illustration
then
came
mr
chillingworth's
voice
who
with
much
earnestness
endeavoured
to
exhort
them
to
moderation
and
to
refrain
from
violence
sir
francis
varney
became
very
pale
agitated
he
immediately
turned
and
taking
the
least
notice
he
made
for
the
wood
which
lay
between
him
and
his
own
house
leaving
the
people
in
the
greatest
agitation
mr
marchdale
was
not
unmoved
at
this
occurrence
but
stood
his
ground
with
henry
bannerworth
the
admiral
and
jack
pringle
until
the
mob
came
very
near
to
them
shouting
and
uttering
cries
of
vengeance
and
death
of
all
imaginable
kinds
that
it
was
possible
to
conceive
against
the
unpopular
vampyre
pending
the
arrival
of
these
infuriated
persons
we
will
in
a
few
words
state
how
it
was
that
so
suddenly
a
set
of
circumstances
arose
productive
of
an
amount
of
personal
danger
to
varney
such
as
up
to
that
time
had
seemed
not
at
all
likely
to
occur
we
have
before
stated
there
was
but
one
person
out
of
the
family
of
the
bannerworths
who
was
able
to
say
anything
of
a
positive
character
concerning
the
singular
and
inexplicable
proceedings
at
the
hall
and
that
that
person
was
mr
chillingworth
an
individual
not
at
all
likely
to
become
garrulous
upon
the
subject
but
alas
the
best
of
men
have
their
weaknesses
and
we
much
regret
to
say
that
mr
chillingworth
so
far
in
this
instance
forgot
that
admirable
discretion
which
commonly
belonged
to
him
as
to
be
the
cause
of
the
popular
tumult
which
had
now
readied
such
a
height
in
a
moment
of
thoughtlessness
and
confidence
he
told
his
wife
yes
this
really
clever
man
from
whom
one
would
not
have
expected
such
a
piece
of
horrible
indiscretion
actually
told
his
wife
all
about
the
vampyre
but
such
is
human
nature
combined
with
an
amount
of
firmness
and
reasoning
power
that
one
would
have
thought
to
be
invulnerable
safeguards
we
find
some
weakness
which
astonishes
all
calculation
such
was
this
of
mr
chillingworth's
it
is
true
he
cautioned
the
lady
to
be
secret
and
pointed
to
her
the
danger
of
making
varney
the
vampyre
a
theme
for
gossip
but
he
might
as
well
have
whispered
to
a
hurricane
to
be
so
good
as
not
to
go
on
blowing
so
as
request
mrs
chillingworth
to
keep
a
secret
of
course
she
burst
into
the
usual
fervent
declarations
of
who
was
she
to
tell
was
she
a
person
who
went
about
telling
things
when
did
she
see
anybody
not
she
once
in
a
blue
moon
and
then
when
mr
chillingworth
went
out
like
the
king
of
otaheite
she
invited
the
neighbours
round
about
to
come
to
take
some
tea
under
solemn
promises
of
secrecy
sixteen
ladies
that
evening
were
made
acquainted
with
the
full
and
interesting
particulars
of
the
attack
of
the
vampyre
on
flora
bannerworth
and
all
the
evidence
inculpating
sir
francis
varney
as
the
blood-thirsty
individual
when
the
mind
comes
to
consider
that
these
sixteen
ladies
multiplied
their
information
by
about
four-and-twenty
each
we
become
quite
lost
in
a
sea
of
arithmetic
and
feel
compelled
to
sum
up
the
whole
by
a
candid
assumption
that
in
four-and-twenty
hours
not
an
individual
in
the
whole
town
was
ignorant
of
the
circumstances
on
the
morning
before
the
projected
duel
there
was
an
unusual
commotion
in
the
streets
people
were
conversing
together
in
little
knots
and
using
rather
violent
gesticulations
poor
mr
chillingworth
he
alone
was
ignorant
of
the
causes
of
the
popular
commotion
and
so
he
went
to
bed
wondering
that
an
unusual
bustle
pervaded
the
little
market
town
but
not
at
all
guessing
its
origin
somehow
or
another
however
the
populace
who
had
determined
to
make
a
demonstration
on
the
following
morning
against
the
vampyre
thought
it
highly
necessary
first
to
pay
some
sort
of
compliment
to
mr
chillingworth
and
accordingly
at
an
early
hour
a
great
mob
assembled
outside
his
house
and
gave
three
terrific
applauding
shouts
which
roused
him
most
unpleasantly
from
his
sleep
and
induced
the
greatest
astonishment
at
the
cause
of
such
a
tumult
oh
that
artful
mrs
chillingworth
too
well
she
knew
what
was
the
matter
yet
she
pretended
to
be
so
oblivious
upon
the
subject
good
god
cried
mr
chillingworth
as
he
started
up
in
bed
what's
all
that
all
what
said
his
wife
all
what
do
you
mean
to
say
you
heard
nothing
well
i
think
i
did
hear
a
little
sort
of
something
a
little
sort
of
something
it
shook
the
house
well
well
never
mind
go
to
sleep
again
it's
no
business
of
ours
yes
but
it
may
be
though
it's
all
very
well
to
say
'go
to
sleep'
that
happens
to
be
a
thing
i
can't
do
there's
something
amiss
well
what's
that
to
you
perhaps
nothing
but
perhaps
everything
mr
chillingworth
sprang
from
his
bed
and
began
dressing
a
process
which
he
executed
with
considerable
rapidity
and
in
which
he
was
much
accelerated
by
two
or
three
supplementary
shouts
from
the
people
below
then
in
a
temporary
lull
a
loud
voice
shouted--
down
with
the
vampyre--down
with
the
vampyre
the
truth
in
an
instant
burst
over
the
mind
of
mr
chillingworth
and
turning
to
his
wife
he
exclaimed--
i
understand
it
now
you've
been
gossipping
about
sir
francis
varney
and
have
caused
all
this
tumult
i
gossip
well
i
never
lay
it
on
me
it's
sure
to
be
my
fault
i
might
have
known
that
beforehand
i
always
am
but
you
must
have
spoken
of
it
who
have
i
got
to
speak
to
about
it
did
you
or
did
you
not
who
should
i
tell
mr
chillingworth
was
dressed
and
he
hastened
down
and
entered
the
street
with
great
desperation
he
had
a
hope
that
he
might
be
enabled
to
disperse
the
crowd
and
yet
be
in
time
to
keep
his
appointment
at
the
duel
his
appearance
was
hailed
with
another
shout
for
it
was
considered
of
course
that
he
had
come
to
join
in
the
attack
upon
sir
francis
varney
he
found
assembled
a
much
more
considerable
mob
than
he
had
imagined
and
to
his
alarm
he
found
many
armed
with
all
sorts
of
weapons
of
offence
hurrah
cried
a
great
lumpy-looking
fellow
who
seemed
half
mad
with
the
prospect
of
a
disturbance
hurrah
here's
the
doctor
he'll
tell
us
all
about
it
as
we
go
along
come
on
for
heaven's
sake
said
mr
chillingworth
stop
what
are
you
about
to
do
all
of
you
burn
the
vampyre--burn
the
vampyre
hold--hold
this
is
folly
let
me
implore
you
all
to
return
to
your
homes
or
you
will
get
into
serious
trouble
on
this
subject
this
was
a
piece
of
advice
not
at
all
likely
to
be
adopted
and
when
the
mob
found
that
mr
chillingworth
was
not
disposed
to
encourage
and
countenance
it
in
its
violence
it
gave
another
loud
shout
of
defiance
and
moved
off
through
the
long
straggling
streets
of
the
town
in
a
direction
towards
sir
francis
varney's
house
it
is
true
that
what
were
called
the
authorities
of
the
town
had
become
alarmed
and
were
stirring
but
they
found
themselves
in
such
a
frightful
minority
that
it
became
out
of
the
question
for
them
to
interfere
with
any
effect
to
stop
the
lawless
proceedings
of
the
rioters
so
that
the
infuriated
populace
had
it
all
their
own
way
and
in
a
straggling
disorderly-looking
kind
of
procession
they
moved
off
vowing
vengeance
as
they
went
against
varney
the
vampyre
hopeless
as
mr
chillingworth
thought
it
was
to
interfere
with
any
degree
of
effect
in
the
proceedings
of
the
mob
he
still
could
not
reconcile
it
to
himself
to
be
absent
from
a
scene
which
he
now
felt
certain
had
been
produced
by
his
own
imprudence
so
he
went
on
with
the
crowd
endeavouring
as
he
did
so
by
every
argument
that
could
be
suggested
to
him
to
induce
them
to
abstain
from
the
acts
of
violence
they
contemplated
he
had
a
hope
too
that
when
they
reached
sir
francis
varney's
finding
him
not
within
as
probably
would
be
the
case
as
by
that
time
he
would
have
started
to
meet
henry
bannerworth
on
the
ground
to
fight
the
duel
he
might
induce
the
mob
to
return
and
forego
their
meditated
violence
and
thus
was
it
that
urged
on
by
a
multitude
of
persons
the
unhappy
surgeon
was
expiating
both
in
mind
and
person
the
serious
mistakes
he
had
committed
in
trusting
a
secret
to
his
wife
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
we
for
one
moment
wish
to
lay
down
a
general
principle
as
regards
the
confiding
secrets
to
ladies
because
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
it
has
become
notorious
how
well
they
keep
them
and
with
what
admirable
discretion
tact
and
forethought
this
fairest
portion
of
humanity
conduct
themselves
we
know
how
few
mrs
chillingworths
there
are
in
the
world
and
have
but
to
regret
that
our
friend
the
doctor
should
in
his
matrimonial
adventure
have
met
with
such
a
specimen
the
popular
riot--sir
francis
varney's
danger--the
suggestion
and
its
results
illustration
such
then
were
the
circumstances
which
at
once
altered
the
whole
aspect
of
the
affairs
and
from
private
and
domestic
causes
of
very
deep
annoyance
led
to
public
results
of
a
character
which
seemed
likely
to
involve
the
whole
country-side
in
the
greatest
possible
confusion
but
while
we
blame
mr
chillingworth
for
being
so
indiscreet
as
to
communicate
the
secret
of
such
a
person
as
varney
the
vampyre
to
his
wife
we
trust
in
a
short
time
to
be
enabled
to
show
that
he
made
as
much
reparation
as
it
was
possible
to
make
for
the
mischief
he
had
unintentionally
committed
and
now
as
he
struggled
onward--apparently
onward--first
and
foremost
among
the
rioters
he
was
really
doing
all
in
his
power
to
quell
that
tumult
which
superstition
and
dread
had
raised
human
nature
truly
delights
in
the
marvellous
and
in
proportion
as
a
knowledge
of
the
natural
phenomena
of
nature
is
restricted
and
unbridled
imagination
allowed
to
give
the
rein
to
fathomless
conjecture
we
shall
find
an
eagerness
likewise
to
believe
the
marvellous
to
be
the
truth
that
dim
and
uncertain
condition
concerning
vampyres
originating
probably
as
it
had
done
in
germany
had
spread
itself
slowly
but
insidiously
throughout
the
whole
of
the
civilized
world
in
no
country
and
in
no
clime
is
there
not
something
which
bears
a
kind
of
family
relationship
to
the
veritable
vampyre
of
which
sir
francis
varney
appeared
to
be
so
choice
a
specimen
the
ghoul
of
eastern
nations
is
but
the
same
being
altered
to
suit
habits
and
localities
and
the
sema
of
the
scandinavians
is
but
the
vampyre
of
a
more
primitive
race
and
a
personification
of
that
morbid
imagination
which
has
once
fancied
the
probability
of
the
dead
walking
again
among
the
living
with
all
the
frightful
insignia
of
corruption
and
the
grave
about
them
although
not
popular
in
england
still
there
had
been
tales
told
of
such
midnight
visitants
so
that
mrs
chillingworth
when
she
had
imparted
the
information
which
she
had
obtained
had
already
some
rough
material
to
work
upon
in
the
minds
of
her
auditors
and
therefore
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
very
soon
establishing
the
fact
under
such
circumstances
ignorant
people
always
do
what
they
have
heard
has
been
done
by
some
one
else
before
them
and
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
propriety
of
catching
sir
francis
varney
depriving
him
of
his
vampyre-like
existence
and
driving
a
stake
through
his
body
became
not
at
all
a
questionable
proposition
alas
poor
mr
chillingworth
as
well
might
he
have
attempted
king
canute's
task
of
stemming
the
waves
of
the
ocean
as
that
of
attempting
to
stop
the
crowd
from
proceeding
to
sir
francis
varney's
house
his
very
presence
was
a
sort
of
confirmation
of
the
whole
affair
in
vain
he
gesticulated
in
vain
he
begged
and
prayed
that
they
would
go
back
and
in
vain
he
declared
that
full
and
ample
justice
should
be
done
upon
the
vampyre
provided
popular
clamour
spared
him
and
he
was
left
to
more
deliberate
judgment
those
who
were
foremost
in
the
throng
paid
no
attention
to
these
remonstrances
while
those
who
were
more
distant
heard
them
not
and
for
all
they
knew
he
might
be
urging
the
crowd
on
to
violence
instead
of
deprecating
it
thus
then
this
disorderly
rabble
soon
reached
the
house
of
sir
francis
varney
and
loudly
demanded
of
his
terrified
servant
where
he
was
to
be
found
the
knocking
at
the
hall
door
was
prodigious
and
with
a
laudable
desire
doubtless
of
saving
time
the
moment
one
was
done
amusing
himself
with
the
ponderous
knocker
another
seized
it
so
that
until
the
door
was
flung
open
by
some
of
the
bewildered
and
terrified
men
there
was
no
cessation
whatever
of
the
furious
demands
for
admittance
varney
the
vampyre--varney
the
vampyre
cried
a
hundred
voices
death
to
the
vampyre
where
is
he
bring
him
out
varney
the
vampyre
the
servants
were
too
terrified
to
speak
for
some
moments
as
they
saw
such
a
tumultuous
assemblage
seeking
their
master
while
so
singular
a
name
was
applied
to
him
at
length
one
more
bold
than
the
rest
contrived
to
stammer
out--
my
good
people
sir
francis
varney
is
not
at
home
he
took
an
early
breakfast
and
has
been
out
nearly
an
hour
the
mob
paused
a
moment
in
indecision
and
then
one
of
the
foremost
cried--
who'd
suppose
they'd
own
he
was
at
home
he's
hiding
somewhere
of
course
let's
pull
him
out
ah
pull
him
out--pull
him
out
cried
many
voices
a
rush
was
made
into
the
hall
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
its
chambers
were
ransacked
and
all
its
hidden
places
carefully
searched
with
the
hope
of
discovering
the
hidden
form
of
sir
francis
varney
the
servants
felt
that
with
their
inefficient
strength
to
oppose
the
proceedings
of
an
assemblage
which
seemed
to
be
unchecked
by
all
sort
of
law
or
reason
would
be
madness
they
therefore
only
looked
on
with
wonder
and
dismay
satisfied
certainly
in
their
own
minds
that
sir
francis
would
not
be
found
and
indulging
in
much
conjecture
as
to
what
would
be
the
result
of
such
violent
and
unexpected
proceedings
mr
chillingworth
hoped
that
time
was
being
gained
and
that
some
sort
of
indication
of
what
was
going
on
would
reach
the
unhappy
object
of
popular
detestation
sufficiently
early
to
enable
him
to
provide
for
his
own
safety
he
knew
he
was
breaking
his
own
engagement
to
be
present
at
the
duel
between
henry
bannerworth
and
sir
francis
varney
and
as
that
thought
recurred
to
him
he
dreaded
that
his
professional
services
might
be
required
on
one
side
or
the
other
for
he
knew
or
fancied
he
knew
that
mutual
hatred
dictated
the
contest
and
he
thought
that
if
ever
a
duel
had
taken
place
which
was
likely
to
be
attended
with
some
disastrous
result
that
was
surely
the
one
but
how
could
he
leave
watched
and
surrounded
as
he
was
by
an
infuriated
multitude--how
could
he
hope
but
that
his
footsteps
would
be
dogged
or
that
the
slightest
attempt
of
his
to
convey
a
warning
to
sir
francis
varney
would
not
be
the
means
of
bringing
down
upon
his
head
the
very
danger
he
sought
to
shield
him
from
in
this
state
of
uncertainty
then
did
our
medical
man
remain
a
prey
to
the
bitterest
reflections
and
full
of
the
direst
apprehensions
without
having
the
slightest
power
of
himself
to
alter
so
disastrous
a
train
of
circumstances
dissatisfied
with
their
non-success
the
crowd
twice
searched
the
house
of
sir
francis
varney
from
the
attics
to
the
basement
and
then
and
not
till
then
did
they
begin
reluctantly
to
believe
that
the
servants
must
have
spoken
the
truth
he's
in
the
town
somewhere
cried
one
let's
go
back
to
the
town
it
is
strange
how
suddenly
any
mob
will
obey
any
impulse
and
this
perfectly
groundless
supposition
was
sufficient
to
turn
their
steps
back
again
in
the
direction
whence
they
came
and
they
had
actually
in
a
straggling
sort
of
column
reached
halfway
towards
the
town
when
they
encountered
a
boy
whose
professional
pursuit
consisted
in
tending
sheep
very
early
of
a
morning
and
who
at
once
informed
them
that
he
had
seen
sir
francis
varney
in
the
wood
half
way
between
bannerworth
hall
and
his
own
home
this
event
at
once
turned
the
whole
tide
again
and
with
renewed
clamours
carrying
mr
chillingworth
along
with
them
they
now
rapidly
neared
the
real
spot
where
probably
had
they
turned
a
little
earlier
they
would
have
viewed
the
object
of
their
suspicion
and
hatred
but
as
we
have
already
recorded
the
advancing
throng
was
seen
by
the
parties
on
the
ground
where
the
duel
could
scarcely
have
been
said
to
have
been
fought
and
then
had
sir
francis
varney
dashed
into
the
wood
which
was
so
opportunely
at
hand
to
afford
him
a
shelter
from
his
enemies
and
from
the
intricacies
of
which--well
acquainted
with
them
as
he
doubtless
was--he
had
every
chance
of
eluding
their
pursuit
the
whole
affair
was
a
great
surprise
to
henry
and
his
friends
when
they
saw
such
a
string
of
people
advancing
with
such
shouts
and
imprecations
they
could
not
for
the
life
of
them
imagine
what
could
have
excited
such
a
turn
out
among
the
ordinarily
industrious
and
quiet
inhabitants
of
a
town
remarkable
rather
for
the
quietude
and
steadiness
of
its
population
than
for
any
violent
outbreaks
of
popular
feeling
what
can
mr
chillingworth
be
about
said
henry
to
bring
such
a
mob
here
has
he
taken
leave
of
his
senses
nay
said
marchdale
look
again
he
seems
to
be
trying
to
keep
them
back
although
ineffectually
for
they
will
not
be
stayed
d----e
said
the
admiral
here's
a
gang
of
pirates
we
shall
be
boarded
and
carried
before
we
know
where
we
are
jack
ay
ay
sir
said
jack
and
is
that
all
you've
got
to
say
you
lubber
when
you
see
your
admiral
in
danger
you'd
better
go
and
make
terms
with
the
enemy
at
once
really
this
is
serious
said
henry
they
shout
for
varney
can
mr
chillingworth
have
been
so
mad
as
to
adopt
this
means
of
stopping
the
duel
impossible
said
marchdale
if
that
had
been
his
intention
he
could
have
done
so
quietly
through
the
medium
of
the
civil
authorities
hang
me
exclaimed
the
admiral
if
there
are
any
civil
authorities
they
talk
of
smashing
somebody
what
do
they
say
jack
i
don't
hear
quite
so
well
as
i
used
you
always
was
a
little
deaf
said
jack
what
a
little
deaf
i
say
why
you
lubberly
lying
swab
how
dare
you
say
so
because
you
was
you
slave-going
scoundrel
for
heaven's
sake
do
not
quarrel
at
such
a
time
as
this
said
henry
we
shall
be
surrounded
in
a
moment
come
mr
marchdale
let
you
and
i
visit
these
people
and
ascertain
what
it
is
that
has
so
much
excited
their
indignation
agreed
said
marchdale
and
they
both
stepped
forward
at
a
rapid
pace
to
meet
the
advancing
throng
the
crowd
which
had
now
approached
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
expectant
little
party
was
of
a
most
motley
description
and
its
appearance
under
many
circumstances
would
cause
considerable
risibility
men
and
women
were
mixed
indiscriminately
together
and
in
the
shouting
the
latter
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
exceeded
the
former
both
in
discordance
and
energy
every
individual
composing
that
mob
carried
some
weapon
calculated
for
defence
such
as
flails
scythes
sickles
bludgeons
c
and
this
mode
of
arming
caused
them
to
wear
a
most
formidable
appearance
while
the
passion
that
superstition
had
called
up
was
strongly
depicted
in
their
inflamed
features
their
fury
too
had
been
excited
by
their
disappointment
and
it
was
with
concentrated
rage
that
they
now
pressed
onward
the
calm
and
steady
advance
of
henry
and
mr
marchdale
to
meet
the
advancing
throng
seemed
to
have
the
effect
of
retarding
their
progress
a
little
and
they
came
to
a
parley
at
a
hedge
which
separated
them
from
the
meadow
in
which
the
duel
had
been
fought
you
seem
to
be
advancing
towards
us
said
henry
do
you
seek
me
or
any
of
my
friends
and
if
so
upon
what
errand
mr
chillingworth
for
heaven's
sake
explain
what
is
the
cause
of
all
this
assault
you
seem
to
be
at
the
head
of
it
seem
to
be
said
mr
chillingworth
without
being
so
you
are
not
sought
nor
any
of
your
friends
who
then
sir
francis
varney
was
the
immediate
reply
indeed
and
what
has
he
done
to
excite
popular
indignation
of
private
wrong
i
can
accuse
him
but
i
desire
no
crowd
to
take
up
my
cause
or
to
avenge
my
quarrels
mr
bannerworth
it
has
become
known
through
my
indiscretion
that
sir
francis
varney
is
suspected
of
being
a
vampyre
is
this
so
hurrah
shouted
the
mob
down
with
the
vampyre
hurrah
where
is
he
down
with
him
drive
a
stake
through
him
said
a
woman
it's
the
only
way
and
the
humanest
you've
only
to
take
a
hedge
stake
and
sharpen
it
a
bit
at
one
end
and
char
it
a
little
in
the
fire
so
as
there
mayt'n't
be
no
splinters
to
hurt
and
then
poke
it
through
his
stomach
the
mob
gave
a
great
shout
at
this
humane
piece
of
advice
and
it
was
some
time
before
henry
could
make
himself
heard
at
all
even
to
those
who
were
nearest
to
him
when
he
did
succeed
in
so
doing
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice--
hear
me
all
of
you
it
is
quite
needless
for
me
to
inquire
how
you
became
possessed
of
the
information
that
a
dreadful
suspicion
hangs
over
the
person
of
sir
francis
varney
but
if
in
consequence
of
hearing
such
news
you
fancy
this
public
demonstration
will
be
agreeable
to
me
or
likely
to
relieve
those
who
are
nearest
or
dearest
to
me
from
the
state
of
misery
and
apprehension
into
which
they
have
fallen
you
are
much
mistaken
hear
him
hear
him
cried
mr
marchdale
he
speaks
both
wisdom
and
truth
if
anything
pursued
henry
could
add
to
the
annoyance
of
vexation
and
misery
we
have
suffered
it
would
assuredly
be
the
being
made
subjects
of
every-day
gossip
and
every-day
clamour
you
hear
him
said
mr
marchdale
yes
we
does
said
a
man
but
we
comes
out
to
catch
a
vampyre
for
all
that
oh
to
be
sure
said
the
humane
woman
nobody's
feelings
is
nothing
to
us
are
we
to
be
woke
up
in
the
night
with
vampyres
sucking
our
bloods
while
we've
got
a
stake
in
the
country
hurrah
shouted
everybody
down
with
the
vampyre
where
is
he
you
are
wrong
i
assure
you
you
are
all
wrong
said
mr
chillingworth
imploringly
there
is
no
vampyre
here
you
see
sir
francis
varney
has
not
only
escaped
but
he
will
take
the
law
of
all
of
you
this
was
an
argument
which
appeared
to
stagger
a
few
but
the
bolder
spirits
pushed
them
on
and
a
suggestion
to
search
the
wood
having
been
made
by
some
one
who
was
more
cunning
than
his
neighbours
that
measure
was
at
once
proceeded
with
and
executed
in
a
systematic
manner
which
made
those
who
knew
it
to
be
the
hiding-place
of
sir
francis
varney
tremble
for
his
safety
it
was
with
a
strange
mixture
of
feeling
that
henry
bannerworth
waited
the
result
of
the
search
for
the
man
who
but
a
few
minutes
before
had
been
opposed
to
him
in
a
contest
of
life
or
death
the
destruction
of
sir
francis
varney
would
certainly
have
been
an
effectual
means
of
preventing
him
from
continuing
to
be
the
incubus
he
then
was
upon
the
bannerworth
family
and
yet
the
generous
nature
of
henry
shrank
with
horror
from
seeing
even
such
a
creature
as
varney
sacrificed
at
the
shrine
of
popular
resentment
and
murdered
by
an
infuriated
populace
he
felt
as
great
an
interest
in
the
escape
of
the
vampyre
as
if
some
great
advantage
to
himself
had
been
contingent
upon
such
an
event
and
although
he
spoke
not
a
word
while
the
echoes
of
the
little
wood
were
all
awakened
by
the
clamorous
manner
in
which
the
mob
searched
for
their
victim
his
feelings
could
be
well
read
upon
his
countenance
the
admiral
too
without
possessing
probably
the
fine
feelings
of
henry
bannerworth
took
an
unusually
sympathetic
interest
in
the
fate
of
the
vampyre
and
after
placing
himself
in
various
attitudes
of
intense
excitement
he
exclaimed--
d--n
it
jack
i
do
hope
after
all
the
vampyre
will
get
the
better
of
them
it's
like
a
whole
flotilla
attacking
one
vessel--a
lubberly
proceeding
at
the
best
and
i'll
be
hanged
if
i
like
it
i
should
like
to
pour
in
a
broadside
into
those
fellows
just
to
let
them
see
it
wasn't
a
proper
english
mode
of
fighting
shouldn't
you
jack
ay
ay
sir
i
should
shiver
me
if
i
see
an
opportunity
if
i
don't
let
some
of
those
rascals
know
what's
what
scarcely
had
these
words
escaped
the
lips
of
the
old
admiral
than
there
arose
a
loud
shout
from
the
interior
of
the
wood
it
was
a
shout
of
success
and
seemed
at
the
very
least
to
herald
the
capture
of
the
unfortunate
varney
by
heaven
exclaimed
henry
they
have
him
god
forbid
said
mr
marchdale
this
grows
too
serious
bear
a
hand
jack
said
the
admiral
we'll
have
a
fight
for
it
yet
they
sha'n't
murder
even
a
vampyre
in
cold
blood
load
the
pistols
and
send
a
flying
shot
or
two
among
the
rascals
the
moment
they
appear
no
no
said
henry
no
more
violence
at
least
there
has
been
enough--there
has
been
enough
even
as
he
spoke
there
came
rushing
from
among
the
trees
at
the
corner
of
the
wood
the
figure
of
a
man
there
needed
but
one
glance
to
assure
them
who
it
was
sir
francis
varney
had
been
seen
and
was
flying
before
those
implacable
foes
who
had
sought
his
life
he
had
divested
himself
of
his
huge
cloak
as
well
as
of
his
low
slouched
hat
and
with
a
speed
which
nothing
but
the
most
absolute
desperation
could
have
enabled
him
to
exert
he
rushed
onward
beating
down
before
him
every
obstacle
and
bounding
over
the
meadows
at
a
rate
that
if
he
could
have
continued
it
for
any
length
of
time
would
have
set
pursuit
at
defiance
bravo
shouted
the
admiral
a
stern
chase
is
a
long
chase
and
i
wish
them
joy
of
it--d----e
jack
did
you
ever
see
anybody
get
along
like
that
ay
ay
sir
you
never
did
you
scoundrel
yes
i
did
when
and
where
when
you
ran
away
off
the
sound
the
admiral
turned
nearly
blue
with
anger
but
jack
looked
perfectly
imperturbable
as
he
added--
you
know
you
ran
away
after
the
french
frigates
who
wouldn't
stay
to
fight
you
ah
that
indeed
there
he
goes
putting
on
every
stitch
of
canvass
i'll
be
bound
and
there
they
come
said
jack
as
he
pointed
to
the
corner
of
the
wood
and
some
of
the
more
active
of
the
vampyre's
pursuers
showed
themselves
it
would
appear
as
if
the
vampyre
had
been
started
from
some
hiding-place
in
the
interior
of
the
wood
and
had
then
thought
it
expedient
altogether
to
leave
that
retreat
and
make
his
way
to
some
more
secure
one
across
the
open
country
where
there
would
be
more
obstacles
to
his
discovery
than
perseverance
could
overcome
probably
then
among
the
brushwood
and
trees
for
a
few
moments
he
had
been
again
lost
sight
of
until
those
who
were
closest
upon
his
track
had
emerged
from
among
the
dense
foliage
and
saw
him
scouring
across
the
country
at
such
headlong
speed
these
were
but
few
and
in
their
extreme
anxiety
themselves
to
capture
varney
whose
precipate
and
terrified
flight
brought
a
firm
conviction
to
their
minds
of
his
being
a
vampyre
they
did
not
stop
to
get
much
of
a
reinforcement
but
plunged
on
like
greyhounds
in
his
track
jack
said
the
admiral
this
won't
do
look
at
that
great
lubberly
fellow
with
the
queer
smock-frock
never
saw
such
a
figure-head
in
my
life
said
jack
stop
him
ay
ay
sir
the
man
was
coming
on
at
a
prodigious
rate
and
jack
with
all
the
deliberation
in
the
world
advanced
to
meet
him
and
when
they
got
sufficiently
close
together
that
in
a
few
moments
they
must
encounter
each
other
jack
made
himself
into
as
small
a
bundle
as
possible
and
presented
his
shoulder
to
the
advancing
countryman
in
such
a
way
that
he
flew
off
it
at
a
tangent
as
if
he
had
run
against
a
brick
wall
and
after
rolling
head
over
heels
for
some
distance
safely
deposited
himself
in
a
ditch
where
he
disappeared
completely
for
a
few
moments
from
all
human
observation
don't
say
i
hit
you
said
jack
curse
yer
what
did
yer
run
against
me
for
sarves
you
right
lubbers
as
don't
know
how
to
steer
in
course
runs
agin
things
bravo
said
the
admiral
there's
another
of
them
the
pursuers
of
varney
the
vampyre
however
now
came
too
thick
and
fast
to
be
so
easily
disposed
of
and
as
soon
as
his
figure
could
be
seen
coursing
over
the
meadows
and
springing
over
road
and
ditch
with
an
agility
almost
frightful
to
look
upon
the
whole
rabble
rout
was
in
pursuit
of
him
by
this
time
the
man
who
had
fallen
into
the
ditch
had
succeeded
in
making
his
appearance
in
the
visible
world
again
and
as
he
crawled
up
the
bank
looking
a
thing
of
mire
and
mud
jack
walked
up
to
him
with
all
the
carelessness
in
the
world
and
said
to
him--
any
luck
old
chap
oh
murder
said
the
man
what
do
you
mean
who
are
you
where
am
i
what's
the
matter
old
muster
fowler
the
fat
crowner
will
set
upon
me
now
have
you
caught
anything
said
jack
caught
anything
yes
you've
been
in
for
eels
haven't
you
d--n
well
it
is
odd
to
me
as
some
people
can't
go
a
fishing
without
getting
out
of
temper
have
it
your
own
way
i
won't
interfere
with
you
and
away
jack
walked
the
man
cleared
the
mud
out
of
his
eyes
as
well
as
he
could
and
looked
after
him
with
a
powerful
suspicion
that
in
jack
he
saw
the
very
cause
of
his
mortal
mishap
but
somehow
or
other
his
immersion
in
the
not
over
limpid
stream
had
wonderfully
cooled
his
courage
and
casting
one
despairing
look
upon
his
begrimed
apparel
and
another
at
the
last
of
the
stragglers
who
were
pursuing
sir
francis
varney
across
the
fields
he
thought
it
prudent
to
get
home
as
fast
he
could
and
get
rid
of
the
disagreeable
results
of
an
adventure
which
had
turned
out
for
him
anything
but
auspicious
or
pleasant
mr
chillingworth
as
though
by
a
sort
of
impulse
to
be
present
in
case
sir
francis
varney
should
really
be
run
down
and
with
a
hope
of
saving
him
from
personal
violence
had
followed
the
foremost
of
the
rioters
in
the
wood
found
it
now
quite
impossible
for
him
to
carry
on
such
a
chase
as
that
which
was
being
undertaken
across
the
fields
after
sir
francis
varney
his
person
was
unfortunately
but
ill
qualified
for
the
continuance
of
such
a
pursuit
and
although
with
the
greatest
reluctance
he
at
last
felt
himself
compelled
to
give
it
up
in
making
his
way
through
the
intricacies
of
the
wood
he
had
been
seriously
incommoded
by
the
thick
undergrowth
and
he
had
accidentally
encountered
several
miry
pools
with
which
he
had
involuntarily
made
a
closer
acquaintance
than
was
at
all
conducive
either
to
his
personal
appearance
or
comfort
the
doctor's
temper
though
generally
speaking
one
of
the
most
even
was
at
last
affected
by
his
mishaps
and
he
could
not
restrain
from
an
execration
upon
his
want
of
prudence
in
letting
his
wife
have
a
knowledge
of
a
secret
that
was
not
his
own
and
the
producing
an
unlooked
for
circumstance
the
termination
of
which
might
be
of
a
most
disastrous
nature
tired
therefore
and
nearly
exhausted
by
the
exertions
he
had
already
taken
he
emerged
now
alone
from
the
wood
and
near
the
spot
where
stood
henry
bannerworth
and
his
friends
in
consultation
the
jaded
look
of
the
surgeon
was
quite
sufficient
indication
of
the
trouble
and
turmoil
he
had
gone
through
and
some
expressions
of
sympathy
for
his
condition
were
dropped
by
henry
to
whom
he
replied--
nay
my
young
friend
i
deserve
it
all
i
have
nothing
but
my
own
indiscretion
to
thank
for
all
the
turmoil
and
tumult
that
has
arisen
this
morning
but
to
what
possible
cause
can
we
attribute
such
an
outrage
reproach
me
as
much
as
you
will
i
deserve
it
a
man
may
prate
of
his
own
secrets
if
he
like
but
he
should
be
careful
of
those
of
other
people
i
trusted
yours
to
another
and
am
properly
punished
enough
said
henry
we'll
say
no
more
of
that
mr
chillingworth
what
is
done
cannot
be
undone
and
we
had
better
spend
our
time
in
reflection
of
how
to
make
the
best
of
what
is
than
in
useless
lamentation
over
its
causes
what
is
to
be
done
nay
i
know
not
have
you
fought
the
duel
yes
and
as
you
perceive
harmlessly
thank
heaven
for
that
nay
i
had
my
fire
which
sir
francis
varney
refused
to
return
so
the
affair
had
just
ended
when
the
sound
of
approaching
tumult
came
upon
our
ears
illustration
what
a
strange
mixture
exclaimed
marchdale
of
feelings
and
passions
this
varney
appears
to
be
at
one
moment
acting
with
the
apparent
greatest
malignity
and
another
seeming
to
have
awakened
in
his
mind
a
romantic
generosity
which
knows
no
bounds
i
cannot
understand
him
nor
i
indeed
said
henry
but
yet
i
somehow
tremble
for
his
fate
and
i
seem
to
feel
that
something
ought
to
be
done
to
save
him
from
the
fearful
consequences
of
popular
feeling
let
us
hasten
to
the
town
and
procure
what
assistance
we
may
but
a
few
persons
well
organised
and
properly
armed
will
achieve
wonders
against
a
desultory
and
ill-appointed
multitude
there
may
be
a
chance
of
saving
him
yet
from
the
imminent
danger
which
surrounds
him
that's
proper
cried
the
admiral
i
don't
like
to
see
anybody
run
down
a
fair
fight's
another
thing
yard
arm
and
yard
arm--stink
pots
and
pipkins--broadside
to
broadside--and
throw
in
your
bodies
if
you
like
on
the
lee
quarter
but
don't
do
anything
shabby
what
do
you
think
of
it
jack
why
i
means
to
say
as
how
if
varney
only
keeps
on
sail
as
he's
been
doing
that
the
devil
himself
wouldn't
catch
him
in
a
gale
and
yet
said
henry
it
is
our
duty
to
do
the
best
we
can
let
us
at
once
to
the
town
and
summons
all
the
assistance
in
our
power
come
on--come
on
his
friends
needed
no
further
urging
but
at
a
brisk
pace
they
all
proceeded
by
the
nearest
footpaths
towards
the
town
it
puzzled
his
pursuers
to
think
in
what
possible
direction
sir
francis
varney
expected
to
find
sustenance
or
succour
when
they
saw
how
curiously
he
took
his
flight
across
the
meadows
instead
of
endeavouring
by
any
circuitous
path
to
seek
the
shelter
of
his
own
house
or
to
throw
himself
upon
the
care
of
the
authorities
of
the
town
who
must
to
the
extent
of
their
power
have
protected
him
he
struck
across
the
fields
apparently
without
aim
or
purpose
seemingly
intent
upon
nothing
but
to
distance
his
pursuers
in
a
long
chase
which
might
possibly
tire
them
or
it
might
not
according
to
their
or
his
powers
of
endurance
we
say
this
seemed
to
be
the
case
but
it
was
not
so
in
reality
sir
francis
varney
had
a
deeper
purpose
and
it
was
scarcely
to
be
supposed
that
a
man
of
his
subtle
genius
and
apparently
far-seeing
and
reflecting
intellect
could
have
so
far
overlooked
the
many
dangers
of
his
position
as
not
to
be
fully
prepared
for
some
such
contingency
as
that
which
had
just
now
occurred
holding
as
he
did
so
strange
a
place
in
society--living
among
men
and
yet
possessing
so
few
attributes
in
common
with
humanity--he
must
all
along
have
felt
the
possibility
of
drawing
upon
himself
popular
violence
he
could
not
wholly
rely
upon
the
secrecy
of
the
bannerworth
family
much
as
they
might
well
be
supposed
to
shrink
from
giving
publicity
to
circumstances
of
so
fearfully
strange
and
perilous
a
nature
as
those
which
had
occurred
amongst
them
the
merest
accident
might
at
any
moment
make
him
the
town's
talk
the
overhearing
of
a
few
chance
words
by
some
gossiping
domestic--some
ebullition
of
anger
or
annoyance
by
some
member
of
the
family--or
a
communication
from
some
friend
who
had
been
treated
with
confidence--might
at
any
time
awaken
around
him
some
such
a
storm
as
that
which
now
raged
at
his
heels
varney
the
vampire
must
have
calculated
this
he
must
have
felt
the
possibility
of
such
a
state
of
things
and
as
a
matter
of
course
politicly
provided
himself
with
some
place
of
refuge
after
about
twenty
minutes
of
hard
chasing
across
the
fields
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
intentions
he
had
such
a
place
of
refuge
and
strange
a
one
as
it
might
appear
he
sped
towards
it
in
as
direct
a
line
as
ever
a
well-sped
arrow
flew
towards
its
mark
that
place
of
refuge
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
appeared
to
be
the
ancient
ruin
of
which
we
have
before
spoken
and
which
was
so
well
known
to
every
inhabitant
of
the
county
truly
it
seemed
like
some
act
of
mere
desperation
for
sir
francis
varney
to
hope
there
to
hide
himself
there
remained
within
of
what
had
once
been
a
stately
pile
but
a
few
grey
crumbling
walls
which
the
hunted
have
would
have
passed
unheeded
knowing
that
not
for
one
instant
could
he
have
baffled
his
pursuers
by
seeking
so
inefficient
a
refuge
and
those
who
followed
hard
and
fast
upon
the
track
of
sir
francis
varney
felt
so
sure
of
their
game
when
they
saw
whither
he
was
speeding
that
they
relaxed
in
their
haste
considerably
calling
loudly
to
each
other
that
the
vampire
was
caught
at
last
for
he
could
be
easily
surrounded
among
the
old
ruins
and
dragged
from
amongst
its
moss-grown
walls
in
another
moment
with
a
wild
dash
and
a
cry
of
exultation
he
sprang
out
of
sight
behind
an
angle
formed
by
what
had
been
at
one
time
one
of
the
principal
supports
of
the
ancient
structure
then
as
if
there
was
still
something
so
dangerous
about
him
that
only
by
a
great
number
of
hands
could
he
be
hoped
to
be
secured
the
infuriated
peasantry
gathered
in
a
dense
circle
around
what
they
considered
his
temporary
place
of
refuge
and
as
the
sun
which
had
now
climbed
above
the
tree
tops
and
dispersed
in
a
great
measure
many
of
the
heavy
clouds
of
morning
shone
down
upon
the
excited
group
they
might
have
been
supposed
there
assembled
to
perform
some
superstitious
rite
which
time
had
hallowed
as
an
association
of
the
crumbling
ruin
around
which
they
stood
by
the
time
the
whole
of
the
stragglers
who
had
persisted
in
the
chase
had
come
up
there
might
have
been
about
fifty
or
sixty
resolute
men
each
intent
upon
securing
the
person
of
one
whom
they
felt
while
in
existence
would
continue
to
be
a
terror
to
all
the
weaker
and
dearer
portions
of
their
domestic
circles
there
was
a
pause
of
several
minutes
those
who
had
come
the
fleetest
were
gathering
breath
and
those
who
had
come
up
last
were
looking
to
their
more
forward
companions
for
some
information
as
to
what
had
occurred
before
their
arrival
all
was
profoundly
still
within
the
ruin
and
then
suddenly
as
if
by
common
consent
there
arose
from
every
throat
a
loud
shout
of
down
with
the
vampyre
down
with
the
vampyre
the
echoes
of
that
shout
died
away
and
then
all
was
still
as
before
while
a
superstitious
feeling
crept
over
even
the
boldest
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
they
had
expected
some
kind
of
response
from
sir
francis
varney
to
the
shout
of
defiance
with
which
they
had
just
greeted
him
but
the
very
calmness
repose
and
absolute
quiet
of
the
ruin
and
all
about
it
alarmed
them
and
they
looked
the
one
at
the
other
as
if
the
adventure
after
all
were
not
one
of
the
pleasantest
description
and
might
not
fall
out
so
happily
as
they
had
expected
yet
what
danger
could
there
be
there
were
they
more
than
half
a
hundred
stout
strong
men
to
cope
with
one
they
felt
convinced
that
he
was
completely
in
their
power
they
knew
the
ruins
could
not
hide
him
and
that
five
minutes
time
given
to
the
task
would
suffice
to
explore
every
nook
and
corner
of
them
and
yet
they
hesitated
while
an
unknown
terror
shook
their
nerves
and
seemingly
from
the
very
fact
that
they
had
run
down
their
game
successfully
they
dreaded
to
secure
the
trophy
of
the
chase
one
bold
spirit
was
wanting
and
if
it
was
not
a
bold
one
that
spoke
at
length
he
might
be
complimented
as
being
comparatively
such
it
was
one
who
had
not
been
foremost
in
the
chase
perchance
from
want
of
physical
power
who
now
stood
forward
and
exclaimed--
what
are
you
waiting
for
now
you
can
have
him
when
you
like
if
you
want
your
wives
and
children
to
sleep
quietly
in
their
beds
you
will
secure
the
vampyre
come
on--we
all
know
he's
here--why
do
you
hesitate
do
you
expect
me
to
go
alone
and
drag
him
out
by
the
ears
any
voice
would
have
sufficed
to
break
the
spell
which
bound
them
this
did
so
and
with
one
accord
and
yells
of
imprecation
they
rushed
forward
and
plunged
among
the
old
walls
of
the
ruin
less
time
than
we
have
before
remarked
would
have
enabled
any
one
to
explore
the
tottering
fabric
sufficient
to
bring
a
conviction
to
their
minds
that
after
all
there
might
have
been
some
mistake
about
the
matter
and
sir
francis
varney
was
not
quite
caught
yet
it
was
astonishing
how
the
fact
of
not
finding
him
in
a
moment
again
roused
all
their
angry
feelings
against
him
and
dispelled
every
feeling
of
superstitious
awe
with
which
he
had
been
surrounded
rage
gave
place
to
the
sort
of
shuddering
horror
with
which
they
had
before
contemplated
his
immediate
destruction
when
they
had
believed
him
to
be
virtually
within
their
very
grasp
over
and
over
again
the
ruins
were
searched--hastily
and
impatiently
by
some
carefully
and
deliberately
by
others
until
there
could
be
no
doubt
upon
the
mind
of
every
one
individual
that
somehow
or
somewhere
within
the
shadow
of
those
walls
sir
francis
varney
had
disappeared
most
mysteriously
then
it
would
have
been
a
strange
sight
for
any
indifferent
spectator
to
have
seen
how
they
shrunk
one
by
one
out
of
the
shadow
of
those
ruins
each
seeming
to
be
afraid
that
the
vampyre
in
some
mysterious
manner
would
catch
him
if
he
happened
to
be
the
last
within
their
sombre
influence
and
when
they
had
all
collected
in
the
bright
open
space
some
little
distance
beyond
they
looked
at
each
other
and
at
the
ruins
with
dubious
expressions
of
countenance
each
no
doubt
wishing
that
each
would
suggest
something
of
a
consolatory
or
practicable
character
what's
to
be
done
now
said
one
ah
that's
it
said
another
sententiously
i'll
be
hanged
if
i
know
he's
given
us
the
slip
remarked
a
third
but
he
can't
have
given
us
the
slip
said
one
man
who
was
particularly
famous
for
a
dogmatical
spirit
of
argumentation
how
is
it
possible
he
must
be
here
and
i
say
he
is
here
find
him
then
cried
several
at
once
oh
that's
nothing
to
do
with
the
argument
he's
here
whether
we
find
him
or
not
one
very
cunning
fellow
laid
his
finger
on
his
nose
and
beckoned
to
a
comrade
to
retire
some
paces
where
he
delivered
himself
of
the
following
very
oracular
sentiment--
my
good
friend
you
must
know
sir
francis
varney
is
here
or
he
isn't
agreed
agreed
well
if
he
isn't
here
it's
no
use
troubling
our
heads
any
more
about
him
but
otherwise
it's
quite
another
thing
and
upon
the
whole
i
must
say
that
i
rather
think
he
is
all
looked
at
him
for
it
was
evident
he
was
big
with
some
suggestion
after
a
pause
he
resumed--
now
my
good
friends
i
propose
that
we
all
appear
to
give
it
up
and
to
go
away
but
that
some
one
of
us
shall
remain
and
hide
among
the
ruins
for
some
time
to
watch
in
case
the
vampyre
makes
his
appearance
from
some
hole
or
corner
that
we
haven't
found
out
oh
capital
said
everybody
then
you
all
agree
to
that
yes
yes
very
good
that's
the
only
way
to
nick
him
now
we'll
pretend
to
give
it
up
let's
all
of
us
talk
loud
about
going
home
they
did
all
talk
loud
about
going
home
they
swore
that
it
was
not
worth
the
trouble
of
catching
him
that
they
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
that
he
might
go
to
the
deuce
in
any
way
he
liked
for
all
they
cared
and
then
they
all
walked
off
in
a
body
when
the
man
who
had
made
the
suggestion
suddenly
cried--
hilloa
hilloa--stop
stop
you
know
one
of
us
is
to
wait
oh
ay
yes
yes
yes
said
everybody
and
still
they
moved
on
but
really
you
know
what's
the
use
of
this
who's
to
wait
that
was
indeed
a
knotty
question
which
induced
a
serious
consultation
ending
in
their
all
with
one
accord
pitching
upon
the
author
of
the
suggestion
as
by
far
the
best
person
to
hide
in
the
ruins
and
catch
the
vampyre
they
then
all
set
off
at
full
speed
but
the
cunning
fellow
who
certainly
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
so
practically
carrying
out
his
own
suggestion
scampered
off
after
them
with
a
speed
that
soon
brought
him
in
the
midst
of
the
throng
again
and
so
with
fear
in
their
looks
and
all
the
evidences
of
fatigue
about
them
they
reached
the
town
to
spread
fresh
and
more
exaggerated
accounts
of
the
mysterious
conduct
of
varney
the
vampyre
varney's
danger
and
his
rescue--the
prisoner
again
and
the
subterranean
vault
illustration
we
have
before
slightly
mentioned
to
the
reader
and
not
unadvisedly
the
existence
of
a
certain
prisoner
confined
in
a
gloomy
dungeon
into
whose
sad
and
blackened
recesses
but
few
and
faint
glimmering
rays
of
light
ever
penetrated
for
by
a
diabolical
ingenuity
the
narrow
loophole
which
served
for
a
window
to
that
subterraneous
abode
was
so
constructed
that
let
the
sun
be
at
what
point
it
might
during
its
diurnal
course
but
a
few
reflected
beams
of
light
could
ever
find
their
way
into
that
abode
of
sorrow
the
prisoner--the
same
prisoner
of
whom
we
before
spoke--is
there
despair
is
in
his
looks
and
his
temples
are
still
bound
with
those
cloths
which
seemed
now
for
many
days
to
have
been
sopped
in
blood
which
has
become
encrusted
in
their
folds
he
still
lives
apparently
incapable
of
movement
how
he
has
lived
so
long
seems
to
be
a
mystery
for
one
would
think
him
scarcely
in
a
state
even
were
nourishment
placed
to
his
lips
to
enable
him
to
swallow
it
it
may
be
however
that
the
mind
has
as
much
to
do
with
that
apparent
absolute
prostration
of
all
sort
of
physical
energy
as
those
bodily
wounds
which
he
has
received
at
the
hands
of
the
enemies
who
have
reduced
him
to
his
present
painful
and
hopeless
situation
occasionally
a
low
groan
burst
from
his
lips
it
seems
to
come
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
heart
and
it
sounds
as
if
it
would
carry
with
it
every
remnant
of
vitality
that
was
yet
remaining
to
him
then
he
moves
restlessly
and
repeats
in
hurried
accents
the
names
of
some
who
are
dear
to
him
and
far
away--some
who
may
perchance
be
mourning
him
but
who
know
not
guess
not
aught
of
his
present
sufferings
as
he
thus
moves
the
rustle
of
a
chain
among
the
straw
on
which
he
lies
gives
an
indication
that
even
in
that
dungeon
it
has
not
been
considered
prudent
to
leave
him
master
of
his
own
actions
lest
by
too
vigorous
an
effort
he
might
escape
from
the
thraldom
in
which
he
is
held
the
sound
reaches
his
own
ears
and
for
a
few
moments
in
the
deep
impatience
of
his
wounded
spirit
he
heaps
malediction
on
the
heads
of
those
who
have
reduced
him
to
his
present
state
but
soon
a
better
nature
seems
to
come
over
him
and
gentler
words
fall
from
his
lips
he
preaches
patience
to
himself--he
talks
not
of
revenge
but
of
justice
and
in
accents
of
more
hopefulness
than
he
had
before
spoken
he
calls
upon
heaven
to
succour
him
in
his
deep
distress
then
all
is
still
and
the
prisoner
appears
to
have
resigned
himself
once
more
to
the
calmness
of
expectation
or
of
despair
but
hark
his
sense
of
hearing
rendered
doubly
acute
by
lying
so
long
alone
in
nearly
darkness
and
in
positive
silence
detects
sounds
which
to
ordinary
mortal
powers
of
perception
would
have
been
by
far
too
indistinct
to
produce
any
tangible
effect
upon
the
senses
it
is
the
sound
of
feet--on
on
they
come
far
overhead
he
hears
them
they
beat
the
green
earth--that
sweet
verdant
sod
which
he
may
never
see
again--with
an
impatient
tread
nearer
and
nearer
still
and
now
they
pause
he
listens
with
all
the
intensity
of
one
who
listens
for
existence
some
one
comes
there
is
a
lumbering
noise--a
hasty
footstep
he
hears
some
one
labouring
for
breath--panting
like
a
hunted
hare
his
dungeon
door
is
opened
and
there
totters
in
a
man
tall
and
gaunt
he
reels
like
one
intoxicated
fatigue
has
done
more
than
the
work
of
inebriation
he
cannot
save
himself
and
he
sinks
exhausted
by
the
side
of
that
lonely
prisoner
the
captive
raises
himself
as
far
as
his
chains
will
allow
him
he
clutches
the
throat
of
his
enervated
visitor
villain
monster
vampyre
he
shrieks
i
have
thee
now
and
locked
in
a
deadly
embrace
they
roll
upon
the
damp
earth
struggling
for
life
together





it
is
mid-day
at
bannerworth
hall
and
flora
is
looking
from
the
casement
anxiously
expecting
the
arrival
of
her
brothers
she
had
seen
from
some
of
the
topmost
windows
of
the
hall
that
the
whole
neighbourhood
had
been
in
a
state
of
commotion
but
little
did
she
guess
the
cause
of
so
much
tumult
or
that
it
in
any
way
concerned
her
she
had
seen
the
peasantry
forsaking
their
work
in
the
fields
and
the
gardens
and
apparently
intent
upon
some
object
of
absorbing
interest
but
she
feared
to
leave
the
house
for
she
had
promised
henry
that
she
would
not
do
so
lest
the
former
pacific
conduct
of
the
vampyre
should
have
been
but
a
new
snare
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
her
so
far
from
her
home
as
to
lead
her
into
some
danger
when
she
should
be
far
from
assistance
and
yet
more
than
once
was
she
tempted
to
forget
her
promise
and
to
seek
the
open
country
for
fear
that
those
she
loved
should
be
encountering
some
danger
for
her
sake
which
she
would
willingly
either
share
with
them
or
spare
them
the
solicitation
however
of
her
brother
kept
her
comparatively
quiet
and
moreover
since
her
last
interview
with
varney
in
which
at
all
events
he
had
shown
some
feeling
for
the
melancholy
situation
to
which
he
had
reduced
her
she
had
been
more
able
to
reason
calmly
and
to
meet
the
suggestions
of
passion
and
of
impulse
with
a
sober
judgment
about
midday
then
she
saw
the
domestic
party
returning--that
party
which
now
consisted
of
her
two
brothers
the
admiral
jack
pringle
and
mr
chillingworth
as
for
mr
marchdale
he
had
given
them
a
polite
adieu
on
the
confines
of
the
grounds
of
bannerworth
hall
stating
that
although
he
had
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
to
come
forward
and
second
henry
bannerworth
in
the
duel
with
the
vampyre
yet
that
circumstance
by
no
means
obliterated
from
his
memory
the
insults
he
had
received
from
admiral
bell
and
therefore
he
declined
going
to
bannerworth
hall
and
bade
them
a
very
good
morning
to
all
this
admiral
bell
replied
that
he
might
go
and
be
d----d
if
he
liked
and
that
he
considered
him
a
swab
and
a
humbug
and
appealed
to
jack
pringle
whether
he
jack
ever
saw
such
a
sanctified
looking
prig
in
his
life
ay
ay
says
jack
this
answer
of
course
produced
the
usual
contention
which
lasted
them
until
they
got
fairly
in
the
house
where
they
swore
at
each
other
to
an
extent
that
was
enough
to
make
any
one's
hair
stand
on
end
until
henry
and
mr
chillingworth
interfered
and
really
begged
that
they
would
postpone
the
discussion
until
some
more
fitting
opportunity
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
were
then
related
to
flora
who
while
she
blamed
her
brother
much
for
fighting
the
duel
with
the
vampyre
found
in
the
conduct
of
that
mysterious
individual
as
regarded
the
encounter
yet
another
reason
for
believing
him
to
be
strictly
sincere
in
his
desire
to
save
her
from
the
consequences
of
his
future
visits
her
desire
to
leave
bannerworth
hall
consequently
became
more
and
more
intense
and
as
the
admiral
really
now
considered
himself
the
master
of
the
house
they
offered
no
amount
of
opposition
to
the
subject
but
merely
said--
my
dear
flora
admiral
bell
shall
decide
in
all
these
matters
now
we
know
that
he
is
our
sincere
friend
and
that
whatever
he
says
we
ought
to
do
will
be
dictated
by
the
best
possible
feelings
towards
us
then
i
appeal
to
you
sir
said
flora
turning
to
the
admiral
very
good
replied
the
old
man
then
i
say--
nay
admiral
interrupted
mr
chillingworth
you
promised
me
but
a
short
time
since
that
you
would
come
to
no
decision
whatever
upon
this
question
until
you
had
heard
some
particulars
which
i
have
to
relate
to
you
which
in
my
humble
opinion
will
sway
your
judgment
and
so
i
did
cried
the
admiral
but
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
flora
my
dear
i'll
be
with
you
in
an
hour
or
two
my
friend
the
doctor
here
has
got
some
sow
by
the
ear
and
fancies
it's
the
right
one
however
i'll
hear
what
he
has
got
to
say
first
before
we
come
to
a
conclusion
so
come
along
mr
chillingworth
and
let's
have
it
out
at
once
flora
said
henry
when
the
admiral
had
left
the
room
i
can
see
that
you
wish
to
leave
the
hall
i
do
brother
but
not
to
go
far--i
wish
rather
to
hide
from
varney
than
to
make
myself
inaccessible
by
distance
you
still
cling
to
this
neighbourhood
i
do
i
do
and
you
know
with
what
hope
i
cling
to
it
perfectly
you
still
think
it
possible
that
charles
holland
may
be
united
to
you
i
do
i
do
you
believe
his
faith
oh
yes
as
i
believe
in
heaven's
mercy
and
i
flora
i
would
not
doubt
him
now
for
worlds
something
even
now
seems
to
whisper
to
me
that
a
brighter
sun
of
happiness
will
yet
dawn
upon
us
and
that
when
the
mists
which
at
present
enshroud
ourselves
and
our
fortunes
pass
away
they
will
disclose
a
landscape
full
of
beauty
the
future
of
which
shall
know
no
pangs
yes
brother
exclaimed
flora
enthusiastically
this
after
all
may
be
but
some
trial
grievous
while
it
lasts
but
yet
tending
eventually
only
to
make
the
future
look
more
bright
and
beautiful
heaven
may
yet
have
in
store
for
us
all
some
great
happiness
which
shall
spring
clearly
and
decidedly
from
out
these
misfortunes
be
it
so
and
may
we
ever
thus
banish
despair
by
such
hopeful
propositions
lean
on
my
arm
flora
you
are
safe
with
me
come
dearest
and
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
morning
air
there
was
indeed
now
a
hopefulness
about
the
manner
in
which
henry
bannerworth
spoke
such
as
flora
had
not
for
some
weary
months
had
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
and
she
eagerly
rose
to
accompany
him
into
the
garden
which
was
glowing
with
all
the
beauty
of
sunshine
for
the
day
had
turned
out
to
be
much
finer
than
the
early
morning
had
at
all
promised
it
would
be
flora
he
said
when
they
had
taken
some
turns
to
and
fro
in
the
garden
notwithstanding
all
that
has
happened
there
is
no
convincing
mr
chillingworth
that
sir
francis
varney
is
really
what
to
us
he
appears
indeed
it
is
so
in
the
face
of
all
evidence
he
neither
will
believe
in
vampyres
at
all
nor
that
varney
is
anything
but
some
mortal
man
like
ourselves
in
his
thoughts
talents
feelings
and
modes
of
life
and
with
no
more
power
to
do
any
one
an
injury
than
we
have
oh
would
that
i
could
think
so
and
i
but
unhappily
we
have
by
far
too
many
and
too
conclusive
evidences
to
the
contrary
we
have
indeed
brother
and
though
while
we
respect
that
strength
of
mind
in
our
friend
which
will
not
allow
him
even
almost
at
the
last
extremity
to
yield
to
what
appear
to
be
stern
facts
we
may
not
ourselves
be
so
obdurate
but
may
feel
that
we
know
enough
to
be
convinced
you
have
no
doubt
brother
most
reluctantly
i
must
confess
that
i
feel
compelled
to
consider
varney
as
something
more
than
mortal
he
must
be
so
and
now
sister
before
we
leave
the
place
which
has
been
a
home
to
us
from
earliest
life
let
us
for
a
few
moments
consider
if
there
be
any
possible
excuse
for
the
notion
of
mr
chillingworth
to
the
effect
that
sir
francis
varney
wants
possession
of
the
house
for
some
purpose
still
more
inimical
to
our
peace
and
prosperity
than
any
he
has
yet
attempted
has
he
such
an
opinion
he
has
'tis
very
strange
yes
flora
he
seems
to
gather
from
all
the
circumstances
nothing
but
an
overwhelming
desire
on
the
part
of
sir
francis
varney
to
become
the
tenant
of
bannerworth
hall
he
certainly
wishes
to
possess
it
yes
but
can
you
sister
in
the
exercise
of
any
possible
amount
of
fancy
imagine
any
motive
for
such
an
anxiety
beyond
what
he
alleges
which
is
merely
that
he
is
fond
of
old
houses
precisely
so
that
is
the
reason
and
the
only
one
that
can
be
got
from
him
heaven
only
knows
if
it
be
the
true
one
it
may
be
brother
as
you
say
it
may
but
there's
a
doubt
nevertheless
flora
i
much
rejoice
that
you
have
had
an
interview
with
this
mysterious
being
for
you
have
certainty
since
that
time
been
happier
and
more
composed
than
i
ever
hoped
to
see
you
again
i
have
indeed
it
is
sufficiently
perceivable
somehow
brother
since
that
interview
i
have
not
had
the
same
sort
of
dread
of
sir
francis
varney
which
before
made
the
very
sound
of
his
name
a
note
of
terror
to
me
his
words
and
all
he
said
to
me
during
that
interview
which
took
place
so
strangely
between
us
indeed
how
i
know
not
tended
altogether
rather
to
make
him
to
a
certain
extent
an
object
of
my
sympathies
rather
than
my
abhorrence
that
is
very
strange
i
own
that
it
is
strange
henry
but
when
we
come
for
but
a
brief
moment
to
reflect
upon
the
circumstances
which
have
occurred
we
shall
i
think
be
able
to
find
some
cause
even
to
pity
varney
the
vampyre
how
thus
brother
it
is
said--and
well
may
i
who
have
been
subject
to
an
attack
of
such
a
nature
tremble
to
repeat
the
saying--that
those
who
have
been
once
subject
to
the
visitations
of
a
vampyre
are
themselves
in
a
way
to
become
one
of
the
dreadful
and
maddening
fraternity
i
have
heard
so
much
sister
replied
henry
yes
and
therefore
who
knows
but
that
sir
francis
varney
may
at
one
time
have
been
as
innocent
as
we
are
ourselves
of
the
terrible
and
fiendish
propensity
which
now
makes
him
a
terror
and
a
reproach
to
all
who
know
him
or
are
in
any
way
obnoxious
to
his
attacks
that
is
true
there
may
have
been
a
time--who
shall
say
there
was
not--when
he
like
me
would
have
shrunk
with
a
dread
as
great
as
any
one
could
have
experienced
from
the
contamination
of
the
touch
even
of
a
vampyre
i
cannot
sister
deny
the
soundness
of
your
reasoning
said
henry
with
a
sigh
but
i
still
no
not
see
anything
even
from
a
full
conviction
that
varney
is
unfortunate
which
should
induce
us
to
tolerate
him
nay
brother
i
said
not
tolerate
what
i
mean
is
that
even
with
the
horror
and
dread
we
must
naturally
feel
at
such
a
being
we
may
afford
to
mingle
some
amount
of
pity
which
shall
make
us
rather
seek
to
shun
him
than
to
cross
his
path
with
a
resolution
of
doing
him
an
injury
i
perceive
well
sister
what
you
mean
rather
than
remain
here
and
make
an
attempt
to
defy
sir
francis
varney
you
would
fly
from
him
and
leave
him
undisputed
master
of
the
field
i
would--i
would
heaven
forbid
that
i
or
any
one
should
thwart
you
you
know
well
flora
how
dear
you
are
to
me
you
know
well
that
your
happiness
has
ever
been
to
us
all
a
matter
which
has
assumed
the
most
important
of
shapes
as
regarded
our
general
domestic
policy
it
is
not
therefore
likely
now
dear
sister
that
we
should
thwart
you
in
your
wish
to
remove
from
here
i
know
henry
all
you
would
say
remarked
flora
as
a
tear
started
to
her
eyes
i
know
well
all
you
think
and
in
your
love
for
me
i
likewise
know
well
i
rely
for
ever
you
are
attached
to
this
place
as
indeed
we
all
are
by
a
thousand
happy
and
pleasant
associations
but
listen
to
me
further
henry
i
do
not
wish
to
wander
far
not
far
flora
no
do
i
not
still
cling
to
a
hope
that
charles
may
yet
appear
and
if
he
do
so
it
will
assuredly
be
in
this
neighbourhood
which
he
knows
is
native
and
most
dear
to
us
all
true
then
do
i
wish
to
make
some
sort
of
parade
in
the
way
of
publicity
of
our
leaving
the
hall
yes
yes
and
yet
not
go
far
in
the
neighbouring
town
for
example
surely
we
might
find
some
means
of
living
entirely
free
from
remark
or
observation
as
to
who
or
what
we
were
that
sister
i
doubt
if
you
seek
for
that
species
of
solitude
which
you
contemplate
it
is
only
to
be
found
in
a
desert
a
desert
yes
or
in
a
large
city
indeed
ay
flora
you
may
well
believe
me
that
it
is
so
in
a
small
community
you
can
have
no
possible
chance
of
evading
an
amount
of
scrutiny
which
would
very
soon
pierce
through
any
disguise
you
could
by
any
possibility
assume
then
there
is
no
resource
we
must
go
far
nay
i
will
consider
for
you
flora
and
although
as
a
general
principle
what
i
have
said
i
know
to
be
true
yet
some
more
special
circumstance
may
arise
that
may
point
a
course
that
while
it
enables
us
for
charles
holland's
sake
to
remain
in
this
immediate
neighbourhood
yet
will
procure
to
us
all
the
secrecy
we
may
desire
dear--dear
brother
said
flora
as
she
flung
herself
upon
henry's
neck
you
speak
cheeringly
to
me
and
what
is
more
you
believe
in
charles's
faithfulness
and
truth
as
heaven
is
my
judge
i
do
a
thousand
thousand
thanks
for
such
an
assurance
i
know
him
too
well
to
doubt
for
one
moment
his
faith
oh
brother
could
he--could
charles
holland
the
soul
of
honour
the
abode
of
every
noble
impulse
that
can
adorn
humanity--could
he
have
written
those
letters
no
no
perish
the
thought
it
has
perished
thank
god
i
only
upon
reflection
wonder
how
misled
for
the
moment
by
the
concurrence
of
a
number
of
circumstances
i
could
ever
have
suspected
him
it
is
like
your
generous
nature
brother
to
say
so
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
there
has
been
one
here
who
has
far
from
feeling
any
sort
of
anxiety
to
think
as
well
as
possible
of
poor
charles
holland
has
done
all
that
in
him
lay
to
take
the
worst
view
of
his
mysterious
disappearance
and
induce
us
to
do
the
like
you
allude
to
mr
marchdale
i
do
well
flora
at
the
same
time
that
i
must
admit
you
have
cause
for
speaking
of
mr
marchdale
as
you
do
yet
when
we
come
to
consider
all
things
there
may
be
found
for
him
excuses
may
there
yes
flora
he
is
a
man
as
he
himself
says
past
the
meridian
of
life
and
the
world
is
a
sad
as
well
as
a
bad
teacher
for
it
soon--too
soon
alas
deprives
us
of
our
trusting
confidence
in
human
nature
it
may
be
so
but
yet
he
knowing
as
he
did
so
very
little
of
charles
holland
judged
him
hastily
and
harshly
you
rather
ought
to
say
flora
that
he
did
not
judge
him
generously
well
be
it
so
and
you
must
recollect
when
you
say
so
that
marchdale
did
not
love
charles
holland
nay
now
said
flora
while
there
flashed
across
her
cheek
for
a
moment
a
heightened
colour
you
are
commencing
to
jest
with
me
and
therefore
we
will
say
no
more
you
know
dear
henry
all
my
hopes
my
wishes
and
my
feelings
and
i
shall
therefore
leave
my
future
destiny
in
your
hands
to
dispose
of
as
you
please
look
yonder
where
there
do
you
not
see
the
admiral
and
mr
chillingworth
walking
among
the
trees
yes
yes
i
do
now
how
very
serious
and
intent
they
are
upon
the
subject
of
their
discourse
they
seem
quite
lost
to
all
surrounding
objects
i
could
not
have
imagined
any
subject
that
would
so
completely
have
absorbed
the
attention
of
admiral
bell
mr
chillingworth
had
something
to
relate
to
him
or
to
propose
of
a
nature
which
perchance
has
had
the
effect
of
enchaining
all
his
attention--he
called
him
from
the
room
yes
i
saw
that
he
did
but
see
they
come
towards
us
and
now
we
shall
probably
hear
what
is
the
subject-matter
of
their
discourse
and
consultation
we
shall
admiral
bell
had
evidently
seen
henry
and
his
sister
for
now
suddenly
as
if
not
from
having
for
the
first
moment
observed
them
and
in
consequence
broken
off
their
private
discourse
but
as
if
they
arrived
at
some
point
in
it
which
enabled
them
to
come
to
a
conclusion
to
be
communicative
the
admiral
came
towards
the
brother
and
sister
well
said
the
bluff
old
admiral
when
they
were
sufficiently
near
to
exchange
words
well
miss
flora
you
are
looking
a
thousand
times
better
than
you
were
i
thank
you
admiral
i
am
much
better
oh
to
be
sure
you
are
and
you
will
be
much
better
still
and
no
sort
of
mistake
now
here's
the
doctor
and
i
have
both
been
agreeing
upon
what
is
best
for
you
indeed
yes
to
be
sure
have
we
not
doctor
we
have
admiral
good
and
what
now
miss
flora
do
you
suppose
it
is
i
really
cannot
say
why
it's
change
of
air
to
be
sure
you
must
get
away
from
here
as
quickly
as
you
can
or
there
will
be
no
peace
for
you
yes
added
mr
chillingworth
advancing
i
am
quite
convinced
that
change
of
scene
and
change
of
place
and
habits
and
people
will
tend
more
to
your
complete
recovery
than
any
other
circumstances
in
the
most
ordinary
cases
of
indisposition
we
always
find
that
the
invalid
recovers
much
sooner
away
from
the
scene
of
his
indisposition
than
by
remaining
in
it
even
though
its
general
salubrity
be
much
greater
than
the
place
to
which
he
may
be
removed
good
said
the
admiral
then
we
are
to
understand
said
henry
with
a
smile
that
we
are
no
longer
to
be
your
guests
admiral
bell
belay
there
cried
the
admiral
who
told
you
to
understand
any
such
thing
i
should
like
to
know
well
but
we
shall
look
upon
this
house
as
yours
now
and
that
being
the
case
if
we
remove
from
it
of
course
we
cease
to
be
your
guests
any
longer
that's
all
you
know
about
it
now
hark
ye
you
don't
command
the
fleet
so
don't
pretend
to
know
what
the
admiral
is
going
to
do
i
have
made
money
by
knocking
about
some
of
the
enemies
of
old
england
and
that's
the
most
gratifying
manner
in
the
world
of
making
money
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
illustration
it
is
an
honourable
mode
of
course
it
is
well
i
am
going
to--what
the
deuce
do
you
call
it
what
that's
just
what
i
want
to
know
oh
i
have
it
now
i
am
going
to
what
the
lawyers
call
invest
it
a
prudent
step
admiral
and
one
which
it
is
to
be
hoped
before
now
has
occurred
to
you
perhaps
it
has
and
perhaps
it
hasn't
however
that's
my
business
and
no
one's
else's
i
am
going
to
invest
my
spare
cash
in
taking
houses
so
as
i
don't
care
a
straw
where
the
houses
may
be
situated
you
can
look
out
for
one
somewhere
that
will
suit
you
and
i'll
take
it
so
after
all
you
will
be
my
guests
there
just
the
same
as
you
are
here
admiral
said
henry
it
would
be
imposing
upon
a
generosity
as
rare
as
it
is
noble
were
we
to
allow
you
to
do
so
much
for
us
as
you
contemplate
very
good
we
cannot--we
dare
not
but
i
say
you
shall
so
you
have
had
your
say
and
i've
had
mine
after
which
if
you
please
master
henry
bannerworth
i
shall
take
upon
myself
to
consider
the
affair
as
altogether
settled
you
can
commence
operations
as
soon
as
you
like
i
know
that
miss
flora
here--bless
her
sweet
eyes--don't
want
to
stay
at
bannerworth
hall
any
longer
than
she
can
help
it
indeed
i
was
urging
upon
henry
to
remove
said
flora
but
yet
i
cannot
help
feeling
with
him
admiral
that
we
are
imposing
upon
your
goodness
go
on
imposing
then
but--
psha
can't
a
man
be
imposed
upon
if
he
likes
d--n
it
that's
a
poor
privilege
for
an
englishman
to
be
forced
to
make
a
row
about
i
tell
you
i
like
it
i
will
be
imposed
upon
so
there's
an
end
of
that
and
now
let's
come
in
and
see
what
mrs
bannerworth
has
got
ready
for
luncheon





it
can
hardly
be
supposed
that
such
a
popular
ferment
as
had
been
created
in
the
country
town
by
the
singular
reports
concerning
varney
the
vampyre
should
readily
and
without
abundant
satisfaction
subside
an
idea
like
that
which
had
lent
so
powerful
an
impulse
to
the
popular
mind
was
one
far
easier
to
set
going
than
to
deprecate
or
extinguish
the
very
circumstances
which
had
occurred
to
foil
the
excited
mob
in
their
pursuit
of
sir
francis
varney
were
of
a
nature
to
increase
the
popular
superstition
concerning
him
and
to
make
him
and
his
acts
appear
in
still
more
dreadful
colours
mobs
do
not
reason
very
closely
and
clearly
but
the
very
fact
of
the
frantic
flight
of
sir
francis
varney
from
the
projected
attack
of
the
infuriated
multitude
was
seized
hold
of
as
proof
positive
of
the
reality
of
his
vampyre-like
existence
then
again
had
he
not
disappeared
in
the
most
mysterious
manner
had
he
not
sought
refuge
where
no
human
being
would
think
of
seeking
refuge
namely
in
that
old
dilapidated
ruin
where
when
his
pursuers
were
so
close
upon
his
track
he
had
succeeded
in
eluding
their
grasp
with
a
facility
which
looked
as
if
he
had
vanished
into
thin
air
or
as
if
the
very
earth
had
opened
to
receive
him
bodily
within
its
cold
embraces
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
few
who
fled
so
precipitately
from
the
ruin
lost
nothing
of
the
wonderful
story
they
had
to
tell
in
the
carrying
it
from
that
place
to
the
town
when
they
reached
their
neighbours
they
not
only
told
what
had
really
occurred
but
they
added
to
it
all
their
own
surmises
and
the
fanciful
creation
of
all
their
own
fears
so
that
before
mid-day
and
about
the
time
when
henry
bannerworth
was
conversing
so
quietly
in
the
gardens
of
the
hall
with
his
beautiful
sister
there
was
an
amount
of
popular
ferment
in
the
town
of
which
they
had
no
conception
all
business
was
suspended
and
many
persons
now
that
once
the
idea
had
been
started
concerning
the
possibility
that
a
vampyre
might
have
been
visiting
some
of
the
houses
in
the
place
told
how
in
the
dead
of
the
night
they
had
heard
strange
noises
how
children
had
shrieked
from
no
apparent
cause--doors
opened
and
shut
without
human
agency
and
windows
rattled
that
never
had
been
known
to
rattle
before
some
too
went
so
far
as
to
declare
that
they
had
been
awakened
out
of
their
sleep
by
noises
incidental
to
an
effort
made
to
enter
their
chambers
and
others
had
seen
dusky
forms
of
gigantic
proportions
outside
their
windows
tampering
with
their
fastenings
and
only
disappearing
when
the
light
of
day
mocked
all
attempts
at
concealment
these
tales
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
all
listened
to
them
with
such
an
eager
interest
that
none
thought
it
worth
while
to
challenge
their
inconsistencies
or
to
express
a
doubt
of
their
truth
because
they
had
not
been
mentioned
before
the
only
individual
and
he
was
a
remarkably
clever
man
who
made
the
slightest
remark
upon
the
subject
of
a
practical
character
hazarded
a
suggestion
that
made
confusion
worse
confounded
he
knew
something
of
vampyres
he
had
travelled
abroad
and
had
heard
of
them
in
germany
as
well
as
in
the
east
and
to
a
crowd
of
wondering
and
aghast
listeners
he
said--
you
may
depend
upon
it
my
friends
this
has
been
going
on
for
some
time
there
have
been
several
mysterious
and
sudden
deaths
in
the
town
lately
people
have
wasted
away
and
died
nobody
knew
how
or
wherefore
yes--yes
said
everybody
there
was
miles
the
butcher
you
know
how
fat
he
was
and
then
how
fat
he
wasn't
a
general
assent
was
given
to
the
proposition
and
then
elevating
one
arm
in
an
oratorical
manner
the
clever
fellow
continued--
i
have
not
a
doubt
that
miles
the
butcher
and
every
one
else
who
has
died
suddenly
lately
have
been
victims
of
the
vampyre
and
what's
more
they'll
all
be
vampyres
and
come
and
suck
other
people's
blood
till
at
last
the
whole
town
will
be
a
town
of
vampyres
but
what's
to
be
done
cried
one
who
trembled
so
excessively
that
he
could
scarcely
stand
under
his
apprehension
there
is
but
one
plan--sir
francis
varney
must
be
found
and
put
out
of
the
world
in
such
a
manner
that
he
can't
come
back
to
it
again
and
all
those
who
are
dead
that
we
have
any
suspicion
of
should
be
taken
up
out
of
their
graves
and
looked
at
to
see
if
they're
rotting
or
not
if
they
are
it's
all
right
but
if
they
look
fresh
and
much
as
usual
you
may
depend
they're
vampyres
and
no
mistake
this
was
a
terrific
suggestion
thrown
amongst
a
mob
to
have
caught
sir
francis
varney
and
immolated
him
at
the
shrine
of
popular
fury
they
would
not
have
shrunk
from
but
a
desecration
of
the
graves
of
those
whom
they
had
known
in
life
was
a
matter
which
however
much
it
had
to
recommend
it
even
the
boldest
stood
aghast
at
and
felt
some
qualms
of
irresolution
there
are
many
ideas
however
which
like
the
first
plunge
into
a
cold
bath
are
rather
uncomfortable
for
the
moment
but
which
in
a
little
time
we
become
so
familiarized
with
that
they
become
stripped
of
their
disagreeable
concomitants
and
appear
quite
pleasing
and
natural
so
it
was
with
this
notion
of
exhuming
the
dead
bodies
of
those
townspeople
who
had
recently
died
from
what
was
called
a
decay
of
nature
and
such
other
failures
of
vitality
as
bore
not
the
tangible
name
of
any
understood
disease
from
mouth
to
mouth
the
awful
suggestion
spread
like
wildfire
until
at
last
it
grew
into
such
a
shape
that
it
almost
seemed
to
become
a
duty
at
all
events
to
have
up
miles
the
butcher
and
see
how
he
looked
there
is
too
about
human
nature
a
natural
craving
curiosity
concerning
everything
connected
with
the
dead
there
is
not
a
man
of
education
or
of
intellectual
endowment
who
would
not
travel
many
miles
to
look
upon
the
exhumation
of
the
remains
of
some
one
famous
in
his
time
whether
for
his
vices
his
virtues
his
knowledge
his
talents
or
his
heroism
and
if
this
feeling
exist
in
the
minds
of
the
educated
and
refined
in
a
sublimated
shape
which
lends
to
it
grace
and
dignity
we
may
look
for
it
among
the
vulgar
and
the
ignorant
taking
only
a
grosser
and
meaner
form
in
accordance
with
their
habits
of
thought
the
rude
materials
of
which
the
highest
and
noblest
feelings
of
educated
minds
are
formed
will
be
found
amongst
the
most
grovelling
and
base
and
so
this
vulgar
curiosity
which
combined
with
other
feelings
prompted
an
ignorant
and
illiterate
mob
to
exhume
miles
the
once
fat
butcher
in
a
different
form
tempted
the
philosophic
hamlet
to
moralise
upon
the
skull
of
yorick
and
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
when
these
people
had
made
up
their
minds
to
carry
out
the
singularly
interesting
but
at
the
same
fearful
suggestion
they
assumed
to
themselves
a
great
virtue
in
so
doing--told
each
other
what
an
absolute
necessity
there
was
for
the
public
good
that
it
should
be
done
and
then
with
loud
shouts
and
cries
concerning
the
vampyre
they
proceeded
in
a
body
to
the
village
churchyard
where
had
been
lain
with
a
hope
of
reposing
in
peace
the
bones
of
their
ancestors
a
species
of
savage
ferocity
now
appeared
to
have
seized
upon
the
crowd
and
the
people
in
making
up
their
minds
to
do
something
which
was
strikingly
at
variance
with
all
their
preconceived
notions
of
right
and
wrong
appeared
to
feel
that
it
was
necessary
in
order
that
they
might
be
consistent
to
cast
off
many
of
the
decencies
of
life
and
to
become
riotous
and
reckless
as
they
proceeded
towards
the
graveyard
they
amused
themselves
by
breaking
the
windows
of
the
tax-gatherers
and
doing
what
passing
mischief
they
could
to
the
habitations
of
all
who
held
any
official
situation
or
authority
this
was
something
like
a
proclamation
of
war
against
those
who
might
think
it
their
duty
to
interfere
with
the
lawless
proceedings
of
an
ignorant
multitude
a
public-house
or
two
likewise
en
route
was
sacked
of
some
of
its
inebriating
contents
so
that
what
with
the
madness
of
intoxication
and
the
general
excitement
consequent
upon
the
very
nature
of
the
business
which
took
them
to
the
churchyard
a
more
wild
and
infuriated
multitude
than
that
which
paused
at
two
iron
gates
which
led
into
the
sanctuary
of
that
church
could
not
be
imagined
those
who
have
never
seen
a
mob
placed
in
such
a
situation
as
to
have
cast
off
all
moral
restraint
whatever
at
the
same
time
that
it
feels
there
is
no
physical
power
to
cope
with
it
can
form
no
notion
of
the
mass
of
terrible
passions
which
lie
slumbering
under
what
in
ordinary
cases
have
appeared
harmless
bosoms
but
which
now
run
riot
and
overcame
every
principle
of
restraint
it
is
a
melancholy
fact
but
nevertheless
a
fact
despite
its
melancholy
that
even
in
a
civilised
country
like
this
with
a
generally
well-educated
population
nothing
but
a
well-organised
physical
force
keeps
down
from
the
commission
of
the
most
outrageous
offences
hundreds
and
thousands
of
persons
we
have
said
that
the
mob
paused
at
the
iron
gates
of
the
churchyard
but
it
was
more
a
pause
of
surprise
than
one
of
vacillation
because
they
saw
that
those
iron
gates
were
closed
which
had
not
been
the
case
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
among
them
at
the
first
building
of
the
church
and
the
enclosure
of
its
graveyard
two
pairs
of
these
massive
gates
had
been
presented
by
some
munificent
patron
but
after
a
time
they
hung
idly
upon
their
hinges
ornamental
certainly
but
useless
while
a
couple
of
turnstiles
to
keep
cattle
from
straying
within
the
sacred
precincts
did
duty
instead
and
established
without
trouble
the
regular
thoroughfare
which
long
habit
had
dictated
as
necessary
through
the
place
of
sepulture
but
now
those
gates
were
closed
and
for
once
were
doing
duty
heaven
only
knows
how
they
had
been
moved
upon
their
rusty
and
time-worn
hinges
the
mob
however
was
checked
for
the
moment
and
it
was
clear
that
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
were
resolved
to
attempt
something
to
prevent
the
desecration
of
the
tombs
those
gates
were
sufficiently
strong
to
resist
the
first
vigorous
shake
which
was
given
to
them
by
some
of
the
foremost
among
the
crowd
and
then
one
fellow
started
the
idea
that
they
might
be
opened
from
the
inside
and
volunteered
to
clamber
over
the
wall
to
do
so
hoisted
up
upon
the
shoulders
of
several
he
grasped
the
top
of
the
wall
and
raised
his
head
above
its
level
and
then
something
of
a
mysterious
nature
rose
up
from
the
inside
and
dealt
him
such
a
whack
between
the
eyes
that
down
he
went
sprawling
among
his
coadjutors
now
nobody
had
seen
how
this
injury
had
been
inflicted
and
the
policy
of
those
in
the
garrison
should
have
been
certainly
to
keep
up
the
mystery
and
leave
the
invaders
in
ignorance
of
what
sort
of
person
it
was
that
had
so
foiled
them
man
however
is
prone
to
indulge
in
vain
glorification
and
the
secret
was
exploded
by
the
triumphant
waving
of
the
long
staff
of
the
beadle
with
the
gilt
knob
at
the
end
of
it
just
over
the
parapet
of
the
wall
in
token
of
victory
it's
waggles
it's
waggles
cried
everybody
it's
waggles
the
beadle
yes
said
a
voice
from
within
it's
waggles
the
beadle
and
he
thinks
as
he
had
yer
there
rather
try
it
again
the
church
isn't
in
danger
oh
no
what
do
you
think
of
this
the
staff
was
flourished
more
vigorously
than
ever
and
in
the
secure
position
that
waggles
occupied
it
seemed
not
only
impossible
to
attack
him
but
that
he
possessed
wonderful
powers
of
resistance
for
the
staff
was
long
and
the
knob
was
heavy
it
was
a
boy
who
hit
upon
the
ingenious
expedient
of
throwing
up
a
great
stone
so
that
it
just
fell
inside
the
wall
and
hit
waggles
a
great
blow
on
the
head
the
staff
was
flourished
more
vigorously
than
ever
and
the
mob
in
the
ecstasy
at
the
fun
which
was
going
on
almost
forgot
the
errand
which
had
brought
them
perhaps
after
all
the
affair
might
have
passed
off
jestingly
had
not
there
been
some
really
mischievous
persons
among
the
throng
who
were
determined
that
such
should
not
be
the
case
and
they
incited
the
multitude
to
commence
an
attack
upon
the
gates
which
in
a
few
moments
must
have
produced
their
entire
demolition
suddenly
however
the
boldest
drew
back
and
there
was
a
pause
as
the
well-known
form
of
the
clergyman
appeared
advancing
from
the
church
door
attired
in
full
canonicals
there's
mr
leigh
said
several
how
unlucky
he
should
be
here
what
is
this
said
the
clergyman
approaching
the
gates
can
i
believe
my
eyes
when
i
see
before
me
those
who
compose
the
worshippers
at
this
church
armed
and
attempting
to
enter
for
the
purpose
of
violence
to
this
sacred
place
oh
let
me
beseech
you
lose
not
a
moment
but
return
to
your
homes
and
repent
of
that
which
you
have
already
done
it
is
not
yet
too
late
listen
i
pray
you
to
the
voice
of
one
with
whom
you
have
so
often
joined
in
prayer
to
the
throne
of
the
almighty
who
is
now
looking
upon
your
actions
this
appeal
was
heard
respectfully
but
it
was
evidently
very
far
from
suiting
the
feelings
and
the
wishes
of
those
to
whom
it
was
addressed
the
presence
of
the
clergyman
was
evidently
an
unexpected
circumstance
and
the
more
especially
too
as
he
appeared
in
that
costume
which
they
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
with
a
reverence
almost
amounting
to
veneration
he
saw
the
favourable
effect
he
had
produced
and
anxious
to
follow
it
up
he
added--
let
this
little
ebullition
of
feeling
pass
away
my
friends
and
believe
me
when
i
assure
you
upon
my
sacred
word
that
whatever
ground
there
may
be
for
complaint
or
subject
for
inquiry
shall
be
fully
and
fairly
met
and
that
the
greatest
exertions
shall
be
made
to
restore
peace
and
tranquillity
to
all
of
you
it's
all
about
the
vampyre
cried
one
fellow--mr
leigh
how
should
you
like
a
vampyre
in
the
pulpit
hush
hush
can
it
be
possible
that
you
know
so
little
of
the
works
of
that
great
being
whom
you
all
pretend
to
adore
as
to
believe
that
he
would
create
any
class
of
beings
of
a
nature
such
as
those
you
ascribe
to
that
terrific
word
oh
let
me
pray
of
you
to
get
rid
of
these
superstitions--alike
disgraceful
to
yourselves
and
afflicting
to
me
the
clergyman
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
crowd
rapidly
thinning
from
before
the
gates
and
he
believed
his
exhortations
were
having
all
the
effect
he
wished
it
was
not
until
he
heard
a
loud
shout
behind
him
and
upon
hastily
turning
saw
that
the
churchyard
had
been
scaled
at
another
place
by
some
fifty
or
sixty
persons
that
his
heart
sunk
within
him
and
he
began
to
feel
that
what
he
had
dreaded
would
surely
come
to
pass
even
then
he
might
have
done
something
in
the
way
of
pacific
exertion
but
for
the
interference
of
waggles
the
beadle
who
spoilt
everything
the
open
graves--the
dead
bodies--a
scene
of
terror
illustration
we
have
said
waggles
spoilt
everything
and
so
he
did
for
before
mr
leigh
could
utter
a
word
more
or
advance
two
steps
towards
the
rioters
waggles
charged
them
staff
in
hand
and
there
soon
ensued
a
riot
of
a
most
formidable
description
a
kind
of
desperation
seemed
to
have
seized
the
beadle
and
certainly
by
his
sudden
and
unexpected
attack
he
achieved
wonders
when
however
a
dozen
hands
got
hold
of
the
staff
and
it
was
wrenched
from
him
and
he
was
knocked
down
and
half-a-dozen
people
rolled
over
him
waggles
was
not
near
the
man
he
had
been
and
he
would
have
been
very
well
content
to
have
lain
quiet
where
he
was
this
however
he
was
not
permitted
to
do
for
two
or
three
who
had
felt
what
a
weighty
instrument
of
warfare
the
parochial
staff
was
lifted
him
bodily
from
the
ground
and
canted
him
over
the
wall
without
much
regard
to
whether
he
fell
on
a
hard
or
a
soft
place
on
the
other
side
this
feat
accomplished
no
further
attention
was
paid
to
mr
leigh
who
finding
that
his
exhortations
were
quite
unheeded
retired
into
the
church
with
an
appearance
of
deep
affliction
about
him
and
locked
himself
in
the
vestry
the
crowd
now
had
entire
possession--without
even
the
sort
of
control
that
an
exhortation
assumed
over
them--of
the
burying-ground
and
soon
in
a
dense
mass
were
these
desperate
and
excited
people
collected
round
the
well-known
spot
where
lay
the
mortal
remains
of
miles
the
butcher
silence
cried
a
loud
voice
and
every
one
obeyed
the
mandate
looking
towards
the
speaker
who
was
a
tall
gaunt-looking
man
attired
in
a
suit
of
faded
black
and
who
now
pressed
forward
to
the
front
of
the
throng
oh
cried
one
it's
fletcher
the
ranter
what
does
he
do
here
hear
him
hear
him
cried
others
he
won't
stop
us
yes
hear
him
cried
the
tall
man
waving
his
arms
about
like
the
sails
of
a
windmill
yes
hear
him
sons
of
darkness
you're
all
vampyres
and
are
continually
sucking
the
life-blood
from
each
other
no
wonder
that
the
evil
one
has
power
over
you
all
you're
as
men
who
walk
in
the
darkness
when
the
sunlight
invites
you
and
you
listen
to
the
words
of
humanity
when
those
of
a
diviner
origin
are
offered
to
your
acceptance
but
there
shall
be
miracles
in
the
land
and
even
in
this
place
set
apart
with
a
pretended
piety
that
is
in
itself
most
damnable
you
shall
find
an
evidence
of
the
true
light
and
the
proof
that
those
who
will
follow
me
the
true
path
to
glory
shall
be
found
here
within
this
grave
dig
up
miles
the
butcher
hear
hear
hear
hurra
said
every
body
mr
fletcher's
not
such
a
fool
after
all
he
means
well
yes
you
sinners
said
the
ranter
and
if
you
find
miles
the
butcher
decaying--even
as
men
are
expected
to
decay
whose
mortal
tabernacles
are
placed
within
the
bowels
of
the
earth--you
shall
gather
from
that
a
great
omen
and
a
sign
that
if
you
follow
me
you
seek
the
lord
but
i
you
find
him
looking
fresh
and
healthy
as
if
the
warm
blood
was
still
within
his
veins
you
shall
take
that
likewise
as
a
signification
that
what
i
say
to
you
shall
be
as
the
gospel
and
that
by
coming
to
the
chapel
of
the
little
boozlehum
ye
shall
achieve
a
great
salvation
very
good
said
a
brawny
fellow
advancing
with
a
spade
in
his
hand
you
get
out
of
the
way
and
i'll
soon
have
him
up
here
goes
like
blue
blazes
the
first
shovelful
of
earth
he
took
up
he
cast
over
his
head
into
the
air
so
that
it
fell
in
a
shower
among
the
mob
which
of
course
raised
a
shout
of
indignation
and
as
he
continued
so
to
dispose
of
the
superfluous
earth
a
general
row
seemed
likely
to
ensue
mr
fletcher
opened
his
mouth
to
make
a
remark
and
as
that
feature
of
his
face
was
rather
a
capacious
one
a
descending
lump
of
mould
of
a
clayey
consistency
fell
into
it
and
got
so
wedged
among
his
teeth
that
in
the
process
of
extracting
it
he
nearly
brought
some
of
those
essential
portions
of
his
anatomy
with
it
this
was
a
state
of
things
that
could
not
last
long
and
he
who
had
been
so
liberal
with
his
spadesful
of
mould
was
speedily
disarmed
and
yet
he
was
a
popular
favourite
and
had
done
the
thing
so
good-humouredly
that
nobody
touched
him
six
or
eight
others
who
had
brought
spades
and
pickaxes
now
pushed
forward
to
the
work
and
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
grave
of
miles
the
butcher
seemed
to
be
very
nearly
excavated
work
of
any
kind
or
nature
whatever
is
speedily
executed
when
done
with
a
wish
to
get
through
it
and
never
perhaps
within
the
memory
of
man
was
a
grave
opened
in
that
churchyard
with
such
a
wonderful
celerity
the
excitement
of
the
crowd
grew
intense--every
available
spot
from
which
a
view
of
the
grave
could
be
got
was
occupied
for
the
last
few
minutes
scarcely
a
remark
had
been
uttered
and
when
at
last
the
spade
of
one
of
those
who
were
digging
struck
upon
something
that
sounded
like
wood
you
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
and
each
one
there
present
drew
his
breath
more
shortly
than
before
there
he
is
said
the
man
whose
spade
struck
upon
the
coffin
those
few
words
broke
the
spell
and
there
was
a
general
murmur
while
every
individual
present
seemed
to
shift
his
position
in
his
anxiety
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
what
was
about
to
ensue
the
coffin
now
having
been
once
found
there
seemed
to
be
an
increased
impetus
given
to
the
work
the
earth
was
thrown
out
with
a
rapidity
that
seemed
almost
the
quick
result
of
the
working
of
some
machine
and
those
closest
to
the
grave's
brink
crouched
down
and
intent
as
they
were
upon
the
progress
of
events
heeded
not
the
damp
earth
that
fell
upon
them
nor
the
frail
brittle
and
humid
remains
of
humanity
that
occasionally
rolled
to
their
feet
it
was
indeed
a
scene
of
intense
excitement--a
scene
which
only
wanted
a
few
prominent
features
in
its
foreground
of
a
more
intellectual
and
higher
cast
than
composed
the
mob
to
make
it
a
fit
theme
for
a
painter
of
the
highest
talent
and
now
the
last
few
shovelfuls
of
earth
that
hid
the
top
of
the
coffin
were
cast
from
the
grave
and
that
narrow
house
which
contained
the
mortal
remains
of
him
who
was
so
well
known
while
in
life
to
almost
every
one
then
present
was
brought
to
the
gaze
of
eyes
which
never
had
seemed
likely
to
have
looked
upon
him
again
the
cry
was
now
for
ropes
with
which
to
raise
the
cumbrous
mass
but
these
were
not
to
be
had
no
one
thought
of
providing
himself
with
such
appliances
so
that
by
main
strength
only
could
the
coffin
be
raised
to
the
brink
the
difficulty
of
doing
this
was
immense
for
there
was
nothing
tangible
to
stand
upon
and
even
when
the
mould
from
the
sides
was
sufficiently
cleared
away
that
the
handles
of
the
coffin
could
be
laid
hold
of
they
came
away
immediately
in
the
grasp
of
those
who
did
so
but
the
more
trouble
that
presented
itself
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
designs
of
the
mob
the
more
intent
that
body
seemed
upon
carrying
out
to
the
full
extent
their
original
designs
finding
it
quite
impossible
by
bodily
strength
to
raise
the
coffin
of
the
butcher
from
the
position
in
which
it
had
got
imbedded
by
excessive
rains
a
boy
was
hastily
despatched
to
the
village
for
ropes
and
never
did
boy
run
with
such
speed
before
for
all
his
own
curiosity
was
excited
in
the
issue
of
an
adventure
that
to
his
young
imagination
was
appallingly
interesting
as
impatient
as
mobs
usually
are
they
had
not
time
in
this
case
for
the
exercise
of
that
quality
of
mind
before
the
boy
came
back
with
the
necessary
means
of
exerting
quite
a
different
species
of
power
against
the
butcher's
coffin
strong
ropes
were
slid
under
the
inert
mass
and
twenty
hands
at
once
plied
the
task
of
raising
that
receptacle
of
the
dead
from
what
had
been
presumed
to
be
its
last
resting-place
the
ropes
strained
and
creaked
and
many
thought
that
they
would
burst
asunder
sooner
than
raise
the
heavy
coffin
of
the
defunct
butcher
it
is
singular
what
reasons
people
find
for
backing
their
opinion
you
may
depend
he's
a
vampyre
said
one
or
it
wouldn't
be
so
difficult
to
get
him
out
of
the
grave
oh
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
that
said
one
when
did
a
natural
christian's
coffin
stick
in
the
mud
in
that
way
ah
to
be
sure
said
another
i
knew
no
good
would
come
of
his
goings
on
he
never
was
a
decent
sort
of
man
like
his
neighbours
and
many
queer
things
have
been
said
of
him
that
i
have
no
doubt
are
true
enough
if
we
did
but
know
the
rights
of
them
ah
but
said
a
young
lad
thrusting
his
head
between
the
two
who
were
talking
if
he
is
a
vampyre
how
does
he
get
out
of
his
coffin
of
a
night
with
all
that
weight
of
mould
a
top
of
him
one
of
the
men
considered
for
a
moment
and
then
finding
no
rational
answer
occur
to
him
he
gave
the
boy
a
box
on
the
ear
saying--
i
should
like
to
know
what
business
that
is
of
yours
boys
now-a-days
ain't
like
the
boys
in
my
time
they
think
nothing
now
of
putting
their
spokes
in
grown-up
people's
wheels
just
as
if
their
opinions
were
of
any
consequence
now
by
a
vigorous
effort
those
who
were
tugging
at
the
ropes
succeeded
in
moving
the
coffin
a
little
and
that
first
step
was
all
the
difficulty
for
it
was
loosened
from
the
adhesive
soil
in
which
it
lay
and
now
came
up
with
considerable
facility
there
was
a
half
shout
of
satisfaction
at
this
result
while
some
of
the
congregation
turned
pale
and
trembled
at
the
prospect
of
the
sight
which
was
about
to
present
itself
the
coffin
was
dragged
from
the
grave's
brink
fairly
among
the
long
rank
grass
that
flourished
in
the
churchyard
and
then
they
all
looked
at
it
for
a
time
and
the
men
who
had
been
most
earnest
in
raising
it
wiped
the
perspiration
from
their
brows
and
seemed
to
shrink
from
the
task
of
opening
that
receptacle
of
the
dead
now
that
it
was
fairly
in
their
power
so
to
do
each
man
looked
anxiously
in
his
neighbour's
face
and
several
audibly
wondered
why
somebody
else
didn't
open
the
coffin
there's
no
harm
in
it
said
one
if
he's
a
vampyre
we
ought
to
know
it
and
if
he
ain't
we
can't
do
any
hurt
to
a
dead
man
oughtn't
we
to
have
the
service
for
the
dead
said
one
yes
said
the
impertinent
boy
who
had
before
received
the
knock
on
the
head
i
think
we
ought
to
have
that
read
backwards
this
ingenious
idea
was
recompensed
by
a
great
many
kicks
and
cuffs
which
ought
to
have
been
sufficient
to
have
warned
him
of
the
great
danger
of
being
a
little
before
his
age
in
wit
where's
the
use
of
shirking
the
job
cried
he
who
had
been
so
active
in
shoveling
the
mud
upon
the
multitude
why
you
cowardly
sneaking
set
of
humbugs
you're
half
afraid
now
afraid--afraid
cried
everybody
who's
afraid
ah
who's
afraid
said
a
little
man
advancing
and
assuming
an
heroic
attitude
i
always
notice
if
anybody's
afraid
it's
some
big
fellow
with
more
bones
than
brains
at
this
moment
the
man
to
whom
this
reproach
was
more
particularly
levelled
raised
a
horrible
shout
of
terror
and
cried
out
in
frantic
accents--
he's
a-coming--he's
a-coming
the
little
man
fell
at
once
into
the
grave
while
the
mob
with
one
accord
turned
tail
and
fled
in
all
directions
leaving
him
alone
with
the
coffin
such
a
fighting
and
kicking
and
scrambling
ensued
to
get
over
the
wall
of
the
grave-yard
that
this
great
fellow
who
had
caused
all
the
mischief
burst
into
such
peals
of
laughter
that
the
majority
of
the
people
became
aware
that
it
was
a
joke
and
came
creeping
back
looking
as
sheepish
as
possible
some
got
up
very
faint
sorts
of
laugh
and
said
very
good
and
swore
they
saw
what
big
dick
meant
from
the
first
and
only
ran
to
make
the
others
run
very
good
said
dick
i'm
glad
you
enjoyed
it
that's
all
my
eye
what
a
scampering
there
was
among
you
where's
my
little
friend
who
was
so
infernally
cunning
about
bones
and
brains
with
some
difficulty
the
little
man
was
extricated
from
the
grave
and
then
oh
for
the
consistency
of
a
mob
they
all
laughed
at
him
those
very
people
who
heedless
of
all
the
amenities
of
existence
had
been
trampling
upon
each
other
and
roaring
with
terror
actually
had
the
impudence
to
laugh
at
him
and
call
him
a
cowardly
little
rascal
and
say
it
served
him
right
but
such
is
popularity
well
if
nobody
won't
open
the
coffin
said
big
dick
i
will
so
here
goes
i
knowed
the
old
fellow
when
he
was
alive
and
many
a
time
he's
d----d
me
and
i've
d----d
him
so
i
ain't
a-going
to
be
afraid
of
him
now
he's
dead
we
was
very
intimate
you
see
'cos
we
was
the
two
heaviest
men
in
the
parish
there's
a
reason
for
everything
ah
dick's
the
fellow
to
do
it
cried
a
number
of
persons
there's
nobody
like
dick
for
opening
a
coffin
he's
the
man
as
don't
care
for
nothing
ah
you
snivelling
curs
said
dick
i
hate
you
if
it
warn't
for
my
own
satisfaction
and
all
for
to
prove
that
my
old
friend
the
butcher
as
weighed
seventeen
stone
and
stood
six
feet
two
and-a-half
on
his
own
sole
i'd
see
you
all
jolly
well--
d----d
first
said
the
boy
open
the
lid
dick
let's
have
a
look
ah
you're
a
rum
un
said
dick
arter
my
own
heart
i
sometimes
thinks
as
you
must
be
a
nevy
or
some
sort
of
relation
of
mine
howsomdever
here
goes
who'd
a
thought
that
i
should
ever
had
a
look
at
old
fat
and
thunder
again--that's
what
i
used
to
call
him
and
then
he
used
to
request
me
to
go
down
below
where
i
needn't
turn
round
to
light
my
blessed
pipe
hell--we
know
said
the
boy
why
don't
you
open
the
lid
dick
i'm
a
going
said
dick
kim
up
he
introduced
the
corner
of
a
shovel
between
the
lid
and
the
coffin
and
giving
it
a
sudden
wrench
he
loosened
it
all
down
one
side
a
shudder
pervaded
the
multitude
and
popularly
speaking
you
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
in
that
crowded
churchyard
at
that
eventful
moment
dick
then
proceeded
to
the
other
side
and
executed
the
same
manoeuvre
now
for
it
he
said
we
shall
see
him
in
a
moment
and
we'll
think
we
seed
him
still
what
a
lark
said
the
boy
you
hold
yer
jaw
will
yer
who
axed
you
for
a
remark
blow
yer
what
do
you
mean
by
squatting
down
there
like
a
cock-sparrow
with
a
pain
in
his
tail
hanging
yer
head
too
right
over
the
coffin
did
you
never
hear
of
what
they
call
a
fluvifium
coming
from
the
dead
yer
ignorant
beast
as
is
enough
to
send
nobody
to
blazes
in
a
minute
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
cold
meat
will
yer
a
what
do
you
say
dick
request
information
from
the
extreme
point
of
my
elbow
dick
threw
down
the
spade
and
laying
hold
of
the
coffin-lid
with
both
hands
he
lifted
it
off
and
flung
it
on
one
side
there
was
a
visible
movement
and
an
exclamation
among
the
multitude
some
were
pushed
down
in
the
eager
desire
of
those
behind
to
obtain
a
sight
of
the
ghastly
remains
of
the
butcher
those
at
a
distance
were
frantic
and
the
excitement
was
momentarily
increasing
they
might
all
have
spared
themselves
the
trouble
for
the
coffin
was
empty--here
was
no
dead
butcher
nor
any
evidence
of
one
ever
having
been
there
not
even
the
grave-clothes
the
only
thing
at
all
in
the
receptacle
of
the
dead
was
a
brick
dick's
astonishment
was
so
intense
that
his
eyes
and
mouth
kept
opening
together
to
such
an
extent
that
it
seemed
doubtful
when
they
would
reach
their
extreme
point
of
elongation
he
then
took
up
the
brick
and
looked
at
it
curiously
and
turned
it
over
and
over
examined
the
ends
and
the
sides
with
a
critical
eye
and
at
length
he
said--
well
i'm
blowed
here's
a
transmogrification
he's
consolidified
himself
into
a
blessed
brick--my
eye
here's
a
curiosity
but
you
don't
mean
to
say
that's
the
butcher
dick
said
the
boy
dick
reached
over
and
gave
him
a
tap
on
the
head
with
the
brick
there
he
said
that's
what
i
calls
occular
demonstration
do
you
believe
it
now
you
blessed
infidel
what's
more
natural
he
was
an
out-and-out
brick
while
he
was
alive
and
he's
turned
to
a
brick
now
he's
dead
give
it
to
me
dick
said
the
boy
i
should
like
to
have
that
brick
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
i'll
see
you
turned
into
a
pantile
first
i
sha'n't
part
with
this
here
it
looks
so
blessed
sensible
it's
a
gaining
on
me
every
minute
as
a
most
remarkable
likeness
d----d
if
it
ain't
by
this
time
the
bewilderment
of
the
mob
had
subsided
now
that
there
was
no
dead
butcher
to
look
upon
they
fancied
themselves
most
grievously
injured
and
somehow
or
other
dick
notwithstanding
all
his
exertions
in
their
service
was
looked
upon
in
the
light
of
a
showman
who
had
promised
some
startling
exhibition
and
then
had
disappointed
his
auditors
the
first
intimation
he
had
of
popular
vengeance
was
a
stone
thrown
at
him
but
dick's
eye
happened
to
be
upon
the
fellow
who
threw
it
and
collaring
him
in
a
moment
he
dealt
him
a
cuff
on
the
side
of
the
head
which
confused
his
faculties
for
a
week
hark
ye
he
then
cried
with
a
loud
voice
don't
interfere
with
me
you
know
it
won't
go
down
there's
something
wrong
here
and
as
one
of
yourselves
i'm
as
much
interested
in
finding
out
what
it
is
as
any
of
you
can
possibly
be
there
seems
to
be
some
truth
in
this
vampyre
business
our
old
friend
the
butcher
you
see
is
not
in
his
grave
where
is
he
then
the
mob
looked
at
each
other
and
none
attempted
to
answer
the
question
why
of
course
he's
a
vampyre
said
dick
and
you
may
all
of
you
expect
to
see
him
in
turn
come
into
your
bed-room
windows
with
a
burst
and
lay
hold
of
you
like
a
million
and
a
half
of
leeches
rolled
into
one
there
was
a
general
expression
of
horror
and
then
dick
continued--
you'd
better
all
of
you
go
home
i
shall
have
no
hand
in
pulling
up
any
more
of
the
coffins--this
is
a
dose
for
me
of
course
you
can
do
what
you
like
illustration
pull
them
all
up
cried
a
voice
pull
them
all
up
let's
see
how
many
vampyres
there
are
in
the
churchyard
well
it's
no
business
of
mine
said
dick
but
i
wouldn't
if
i
was
you
you
may
depend
said
one
that
dick
knows
something
about
it
or
he
wouldn't
take
it
so
easy
ah
down
with
him
said
the
man
who
had
received
the
box
on
the
ears
he's
perhaps
a
vampyre
himself
the
mob
made
a
demonstration
towards
him
but
dick
stood
his
ground
and
they
paused
again
now
you're
a
cowardly
set
he
said
cause
you're
disappointed
you
want
to
come
upon
me
now
i'll
just
show
what
a
little
thing
will
frighten
you
all
again
and
i
warn
beforehand
it
will
so
you
sha'n't
say
you
didn't
know
it
and
were
taken
by
surprise
the
mob
looked
at
him
wondering
what
he
was
going
to
do
once
twice
thrice
he
said
and
then
he
flung
the
brick
up
into
the
air
an
immense
height
and
shouted
heads
in
a
loud
tone
a
general
dispersion
of
the
crowd
ensued
and
the
brick
fell
in
the
centre
of
a
very
large
circle
indeed
there
you
are
again
said
dick
why
what
a
nice
act
you
are
what
fun
said
the
boy
it's
a
famous
coffin
this
dick
and
he
laid
himself
down
in
the
butcher's
last
resting-place
i
never
was
in
a
coffin
before--it's
snug
enough
ah
you're
a
rum
'un
said
dick
you're
such
a
inquiring
genius
you
is
you'll
get
your
head
into
some
hole
one
day
and
not
be
able
to
get
it
out
again
and
then
i
shall
see
you
a
kicking
hush
lay
still--don't
say
anything
good
again
said
the
boy
what
shall
i
do
give
a
sort
of
a
howl
and
a
squeak
when
they've
all
come
back
again
won't
i
said
the
boy
pop
on
the
lid
there
you
are
said
dick
d----d
if
i
don't
adopt
you
and
bring
you
up
to
the
science
of
nothing
now
listen
to
me
good
people
all
added
dick
i
have
really
got
something
to
say
to
you
at
this
intimation
the
people
slowly
gathered
again
round
the
grave
listen
said
dick
solemnly
it
strikes
me
there's
some
tremendous
do
going
on
yes
there
is
said
several
who
were
foremost
it
won't
be
long
before
you'll
all
of
you
be
most
d--nably
astonished
but
let
me
beg
of
all
you
not
to
accuse
me
of
having
anything
to
do
with
it
provided
i
tell
you
all
i
know
no
dick
we
won't--we
won't--we
won't
good
then
listen
i
don't
know
anything
but
i'll
tell
you
what
i
think
and
that's
as
good
i
don't
think
that
this
brick
is
the
butcher
but
i
think
that
when
you
least
expect
it--hush
come
a
little
closer
yes
yes
we
are
closer
well
then
i
say
when
you
all
least
expect
it
and
when
you
ain't
dreaming
of
such
a
thing
you'll
hear
something
of
my
fat
friend
as
is
dead
and
gone
that
will
astonish
you
all
dick
paused
and
he
gave
the
coffin
a
slight
kick
as
intimation
to
the
boy
that
he
might
as
well
be
doing
his
part
in
the
drama
upon
which
that
ingenious
young
gentleman
set
up
such
a
howl
that
even
dick
jumped
so
unearthly
did
it
sound
within
the
confines
of
that
receptacle
of
the
dead
but
if
the
effect
upon
him
was
great
what
must
it
have
been
upon
those
whom
it
took
completely
unawares
for
a
moment
or
two
they
seemed
completely
paralysed
and
then
they
frightened
the
boy
for
the
shout
of
terror
that
rose
from
so
many
throats
at
once
was
positively
alarming
this
jest
of
dick's
was
final
for
before
three
minutes
had
elapsed
the
churchyard
was
clear
of
all
human
occupants
save
himself
and
the
boy
who
had
played
his
part
so
well
in
the
coffin
get
out
said
dick
it's
all
right--we've
done
'em
at
last
and
now
you
may
depend
upon
it
they
won't
be
in
a
hurry
to
come
here
again
you
keep
your
own
counsel
or
else
somebody
will
serve
you
out
for
this
i
don't
think
you're
altogether
averse
to
a
bit
of
fun
and
if
you
keep
yourself
quiet
you'll
have
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
what's
said
about
this
affair
in
every
pot-house
in
the
village
and
no
mistake
the
preparations
for
leaving
bannerworth
hall
and
the
mysterious
conduct
of
the
admiral
and
mr
chillingworth
illustration
it
seemed
now
that
by
the
concurrence
of
all
parties
bannerworth
hall
was
to
be
abandoned
and
notwithstanding
henry
was
loth--as
he
had
indeed
from
the
first
shown
himself--to
leave
the
ancient
abode
of
his
race
yet
as
not
only
flora
but
the
admiral
and
his
friend
mr
chillingworth
seemed
to
be
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
a
prudent
course
to
adopt
he
felt
that
it
would
not
become
him
to
oppose
the
measure
he
however
now
made
his
consent
to
depend
wholly
upon
the
full
and
free
acquiescence
of
every
member
of
the
family
if
he
said
there
be
any
among
us
who
will
say
to
me
'continue
to
keep
open
the
house
in
which
we
have
passed
so
many
happy
hours
and
let
the
ancient
home
of
our
race
still
afford
a
shelter
to
us'
i
shall
feel
myself
bound
to
do
so
but
if
both
my
mother
and
my
brother
agree
to
a
departure
from
it
and
that
its
hearth
shall
be
left
cold
and
desolate
be
it
so
i
will
not
stand
in
the
way
of
any
unanimous
wish
or
arrangement
we
may
consider
that
then
as
settled
said
the
admiral
for
i
have
spoken
to
your
brother
and
he
is
of
our
opinion
therefore
my
boy
we
may
all
be
off
as
soon
as
we
can
conveniently
get
under
weigh
but
my
mother
oh
there
i
don't
know
you
must
speak
to
her
yourself
i
never
if
i
can
help
it
interfere
with
the
women
folks
if
she
consent
then
i
am
willing
will
you
ask
her
i
will
not
ask
her
to
leave
because
i
know
then
what
answer
she
would
at
once
give
but
she
shall
hear
the
proposition
and
i
will
leave
her
to
decide
upon
it
unbiased
in
her
judgment
by
any
stated
opinion
of
mine
upon
the
matter
good
that'll
do
and
the
proper
way
to
put
it
too
there's
no
mistake
about
that
i
can
tell
you
henry
although
he
went
through
the
ceremony
of
consulting
his
mother
had
no
sort
of
doubt
before
he
did
so
that
she
was
sufficiently
aware
of
the
feelings
and
wishes
of
flora
to
be
prepared
to
yield
a
ready
assent
to
the
proposition
of
leaving
the
hall
moreover
mr
marchdale
had
from
the
first
been
an
advocate
of
such
a
course
of
proceeding
and
henry
well
knew
how
strong
an
influence
he
had
over
mrs
bannerworth's
mind
in
consequence
of
the
respect
in
which
she
held
him
as
an
old
and
valued
friend
he
was
therefore
prepared
for
what
his
mother
said
which
was--
my
dear
henry
you
know
that
the
wishes
of
my
children
since
they
have
been
grown
up
and
capable
of
coming
to
a
judgment
for
themselves
have
ever
been
laws
to
me
if
you
among
you
all
agree
to
leave
this
place
do
so
but
will
you
leave
it
freely
mother
most
freely
i
go
with
you
all
what
is
it
that
has
made
this
house
and
all
its
appurtenances
pleasant
in
my
eyes
but
the
presence
in
it
of
those
who
are
so
dear
to
me
if
you
all
leave
it
you
take
with
you
the
only
charms
it
ever
possessed
so
it
becomes
in
itself
as
nothing
i
am
quite
ready
to
accompany
you
all
anywhere
so
that
we
do
but
keep
together
then
mother
we
may
consider
that
as
settled
as
you
please
'it's
scarcely
as
i
please
i
must
confess
that
i
would
fain
have
clung
with
a
kind
of
superstitious
reverence
to
this
ancient
abiding-place
of
my
race
but
it
may
not
be
so
those
perchance
who
are
more
practically
able
to
come
to
correct
conclusions
in
consequence
of
their
feelings
not
being
sufficiently
interested
to
lead
them
astray
have
decided
otherwise
and
therefore
i
am
content
to
leave
do
not
grieve
at
it
henry
there
has
hung
a
cloud
of
misfortune
over
us
all
since
the
garden
of
this
house
became
the
scene
of
an
event
which
we
can
none
of
us
remember
but
with
terror
and
shuddering
two
generations
of
our
family
must
live
and
die
before
the
remembrance
of
that
circumstance
can
be
obliterated
but
we
will
think
of
it
no
more
there
can
no
doubt
but
that
the
dreadful
circumstance
to
which
both
mrs
bannerworth
and
henry
alluded
was
the
suicide
of
the
father
of
the
family
in
the
gardens
which
before
has
been
hinted
at
in
the
course
of
this
narration
as
being
a
circumstance
which
had
created
a
great
sensation
at
the
time
and
cast
a
great
gloom
for
many
months
over
the
family
the
reader
will
doubtless
too
recollect
that
at
his
last
moments
this
unhappy
individual
was
said
to
have
uttered
some
incoherent
words
about
some
hidden
money
and
that
the
rapid
hand
of
death
alone
seemed
to
prevent
him
from
being
explicit
upon
that
subject
and
left
it
merely
a
matter
of
conjecture
as
years
had
rolled
on
this
affair
even
as
a
subject
of
speculation
had
ceased
to
occupy
the
minds
of
any
of
the
bannerworth
family
and
several
of
their
friends
among
whom
was
mr
marchdale
were
decidedly
of
opinion
that
the
apparently
pointed
and
mysterious
words
uttered
were
but
the
disordered
wanderings
of
an
intellect
already
hovering
on
the
confines
of
eternity
indeed
far
from
any
money
of
any
amount
being
a
disturbance
to
the
last
moments
of
the
dissolute
man
whose
vices
and
extravagances
had
brought
his
family
to
such
ruin
it
was
pretty
generally
believed
that
he
had
committed
suicide
simply
from
a
conviction
of
the
impossibility
of
raising
any
more
supplies
of
cash
to
enable
him
to
carry
on
the
career
which
he
had
pursued
for
so
long
but
to
resume
henry
at
once
communicated
to
the
admiral
what
his
mother
had
said
and
then
the
whole
question
regarding
the
removal
being
settled
in
the
affirmative
nothing
remained
to
be
done
but
to
set
about
it
as
quickly
as
possible
the
bannerworths
lived
sufficiently
distant
from
the
town
to
be
out
of
earshot
of
the
disturbances
which
were
then
taking
place
and
so
completely
isolated
were
they
from
all
sort
of
society
that
they
had
no
notion
of
the
popular
disturbance
which
varney
the
vampyre
had
given
rise
to
it
was
not
until
the
following
morning
that
mr
chillingworth
who
had
been
home
in
the
meantime
brought
word
of
what
had
taken
place
and
that
great
commotion
was
still
in
the
town
and
that
the
civil
authorities
finding
themselves
by
far
too
weak
to
contend
against
the
popular
will
had
sent
for
assistance
to
a
garrison
town
some
twenty
miles
distant
it
was
a
great
grief
to
the
bannerworth
family
to
hear
these
tidings
not
that
they
were
in
any
way
except
as
victims
accessory
to
creating
the
disturbance
about
the
vampyre
but
it
seemed
to
promise
a
kind
of
notoriety
which
they
might
well
shrink
from
and
which
they
were
just
the
people
to
view
with
dislike
view
the
matter
how
we
like
however
it
is
not
to
be
considered
as
at
all
probable
that
the
bannerworth
family
would
remain
long
in
ignorance
of
what
a
great
sensation
they
had
created
unwittingly
in
the
neighbourhood
the
very
reasons
which
had
induced
their
servants
to
leave
their
establishment
and
prefer
throwing
themselves
completely
out
of
place
rather
than
remain
in
so
ill-omened
a
house
were
sure
to
be
bruited
abroad
far
and
wide
and
that
perhaps
when
they
came
to
consider
of
it
would
suffice
to
form
another
good
and
substantial
reason
for
leaving
the
hall
and
seeking
a
refuge
in
obscurity
from
the
extremely
troublesome
sort
of
popularity
incidental
to
their
peculiar
situation
mr
chillingworth
felt
uncommonly
chary
of
telling
them
all
that
had
taken
place
although
he
was
well
aware
that
the
proceedings
of
the
riotous
mob
had
not
terminated
with
the
little
disappointment
at
the
old
ruin
to
which
they
had
so
effectually
chased
varney
the
vampyre
but
to
lose
him
so
singularly
when
he
got
there
no
doubt
he
possessed
the
admiral
with
the
uproar
that
was
going
on
in
the
town
for
the
latter
did
hint
a
little
of
it
to
henry
bannerworth
hilloa
he
said
to
henry
as
he
saw
him
walking
in
the
garden
it
strikes
me
if
you
and
your
ship's
crew
continue
in
these
latitudes
you'll
get
as
notorious
as
the
flying
dutchman
in
the
southern
ocean
how
do
you
mean
said
henry
why
it's
a
sure
going
proverb
to
say
that
a
nod's
as
good
as
a
wink
but
the
fact
is
it's
getting
rather
too
well
known
to
be
pleasant
that
a
vampyre
has
struck
up
rather
a
close
acquaintance
with
your
family
i
understand
there's
a
precious
row
in
the
town
indeed
yes
bother
the
particulars
for
i
don't
know
them
but
hark
ye
by
to-morrow
i'll
have
found
a
place
for
you
to
go
to
so
pack
up
the
sticks
get
all
your
stores
ready
to
clear
out
and
make
yourself
scarce
from
this
place
i
understand
you
said
henry
we
have
become
the
subject
of
popular
rumour
i've
only
to
beg
of
you
admiral
that
you'll
say
nothing
of
this
to
flora
she
has
already
suffered
enough
heaven
knows
do
not
let
her
have
the
additional
infliction
of
thinking
that
her
name
is
made
familiar
in
every
pothouse
in
the
town
leave
me
alone
for
that
said
the
admiral
do
you
think
i'm
an
ass
ay
ay
said
jack
pringle
who
came
in
at
that
moment
and
thought
the
question
was
addressed
to
him
who
spoke
to
you
you
bad-looking
horse-marine
me
a
horse-marine
didn't
you
ask
a
plain
question
of
a
fellow
and
get
a
plain
answer
why
you
son
of
a
bad
looking
gun
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
tell
you
what
it
is
jack
i've
let
you
come
sneaking
too
often
on
the
quarter-deck
and
now
you
come
poking
your
fun
at
your
officers
you
rascal
i
poking
fun
said
jack
couldn't
think
of
such
a
thing
i
should
just
as
soon
think
of
you
making
a
joke
as
me
now
i
tell
you
what
it
is
i
shall
just
strike
you
off
the
ship's
books
and
you
shall
just
go
and
cruise
by
yourself
i've
done
with
you
go
and
tell
that
to
the
marines
if
you
like
said
jack
i
ain't
done
with
you
yet
for
a
jolly
long
watch
why
what
do
you
suppose
would
become
of
you
you
great
babby
without
me
ain't
i
always
a
conveying
you
from
place
to
place
and
steering
you
through
all
sorts
of
difficulties
d---n
your
impudence
well
then
d---n
yours
shiver
my
timbers
ay
you
may
do
what
you
like
with
your
own
timbers
and
you
won't
leave
me
sartingly
not
come
here
then
jack
might
have
expected
a
gratuity
for
he
advanced
with
alacrity
there
said
the
admiral
as
he
laid
his
stick
across
his
shoulders
that's
your
last
month's
wages
don't
spend
it
all
at
once
well
i'm
d----d
said
jack
who'd
have
thought
of
that--he's
a
turning
rumgumtious
and
no
mistake
howsomdever
i
must
turn
it
over
in
my
mind
and
be
even
with
him
somehow--i
owes
him
one
for
that
i
say
admiral
what
now
you
lubber
nothing
turn
that
over
in
your
mind
and
away
jack
walked
not
quite
satisfied
but
feeling
at
least
that
he
had
made
a
demonstration
of
attack
as
for
the
admiral
he
considered
that
the
thump
he
had
given
jack
with
the
stick
and
it
was
no
gentle
one
was
a
decided
balancing
of
accounts
up
to
that
period
and
as
he
remained
likewise
master
of
the
field
he
was
upon
the
whole
very
well
satisfied
these
last
few
words
which
had
been
spoken
to
henry
by
admiral
bell
more
than
any
others
induced
him
to
hasten
his
departure
from
bannerworth
hall
he
had
walked
away
when
the
altercation
between
jack
pringle
and
the
admiral
began
for
he
had
seen
sufficient
of
those
wordy
conflicts
between
those
originals
to
be
quite
satisfied
that
neither
of
them
meant
what
he
said
of
a
discouraging
character
towards
the
other
and
that
far
from
there
being
any
unfriendly
feeling
contingent
upon
those
little
affairs
they
were
only
a
species
of
friendly
sparring
which
both
parties
enjoyed
extremely
he
went
direct
to
flora
and
he
said
to
her--
since
we
are
all
agreed
upon
the
necessity
or
at
all
events
upon
the
expediency
of
a
departure
from
the
hall
i
think
sister
the
sooner
we
carry
out
that
determination
the
better
and
the
pleasanter
for
us
all
it
will
be
do
you
think
you
could
remove
so
hastily
as
to-morrow
to-morrow
that
is
soon
indeed
i
grant
you
that
it
is
so
but
admiral
bell
assures
me
that
he
will
have
everything
in
readiness
and
a
place
provided
for
us
to
go
to
by
then
would
it
be
possible
to
remove
from
a
house
like
this
so
very
quickly
yes
sister
if
you
look
around
you
you
will
see
that
a
great
portion
of
the
comforts
you
enjoy
in
this
mansion
belong
to
it
as
a
part
of
its
very
structure
and
are
not
removable
at
pleasure
what
we
really
have
to
take
away
is
very
little
the
urgent
want
of
money
during
our
father's
lifetime
induced
him
as
you
may
recollect
even
at
various
times
to
part
with
much
that
was
ornamental
as
well
as
useful
which
was
in
the
hall
you
will
recollect
that
we
seldom
returned
from
those
little
continental
tours
which
to
us
were
so
delightful
without
finding
some
old
familiar
objects
gone
which
upon
inquiry
we
found
had
been
turned
into
money
to
meet
some
more
than
usually
pressing
demand
that
is
true
brother
i
recollect
well
so
that
upon
the
whole
sister
there
is
little
to
remove
well
well
be
it
so
i
will
prepare
our
mother
for
this
sudden
step
believe
me
my
heart
goes
with
it
and
as
a
force
of
vengeful
circumstances
have
induced
us
to
remove
from
this
home
which
was
once
so
full
of
pleasant
recollections
it
is
certainly
better
as
you
say
that
the
act
should
be
at
once
consummated
than
left
hanging
in
terror
over
our
minds
then
i'll
consider
that
as
settled
said
henry
the
removal
from
the
hall--the
night
watch
and
the
alarm
illustration
mrs
bannerworth's
consent
having
been
already
given
to
the
removal
she
said
at
once
when
appealed
to
that
she
was
quite
ready
to
go
at
any
time
her
children
thought
expedient
upon
this
henry
sought
the
admiral
and
told
him
as
much
at
the
same
time
adding--
my
sister
feared
that
we
should
have
considerable
trouble
in
the
removal
but
i
have
convinced
her
that
such
will
not
be
the
case
as
we
are
by
no
means
overburdened
with
cumbrous
property
cumbrous
property
said
the
admiral
why
what
do
you
mean
i
beg
leave
to
say
that
when
i
took
the
house
i
took
the
table
and
chairs
with
it
d--n
it
what
good
do
you
suppose
an
empty
house
is
to
me
the
tables
and
chairs
yes
i
took
the
house
just
as
it
stands
don't
try
and
bamboozle
me
out
of
it
i
tell
you
you've
nothing
to
move
but
yourselves
and
immediate
personal
effects
i
was
not
aware
admiral
that
that
was
your
plan
well
then
now
you
are
listen
to
me
i've
circumvented
the
enemy
too
often
not
to
know
how
to
get
up
a
plot
jack
and
i
have
managed
it
all
to-morrow
evening
after
dark
and
before
the
moon's
got
high
enough
to
throw
any
light
you
and
your
brother
and
miss
flora
and
your
mother
will
come
out
of
the
house
and
jack
and
i
will
lead
you
where
you're
to
go
to
there's
plenty
of
furniture
where
you're
a-going
and
so
you
will
get
off
free
without
anybody
knowing
anything
about
it
well
admiral
i've
said
it
before
and
it
is
the
unanimous
opinion
of
us
all
that
everything
should
be
left
to
you
you
have
proved
yourself
too
good
a
friend
to
us
for
us
to
hesitate
at
all
in
obeying
your
commands
arrange
everything
i
pray
you
according
to
your
wishes
and
feelings
and
you
will
find
there
shall
be
no
cavilling
on
our
parts
that's
right
there's
nothing
like
giving
a
command
to
some
one
person
there's
no
good
done
without
now
i'll
manage
it
all
mind
you
seven
o'clock
to-morrow
evening
everything
is
to
be
ready
and
you
will
all
be
prepared
to
leave
the
hall
it
shall
be
so
who's
that
giving
such
a
thundering
ring
at
the
gate
nay
i
know
not
we
have
few
visitors
and
no
servants
so
i
must
e'en
be
my
own
gate
porter
henry
walked
to
the
gate
and
having
opened
it
a
servant
in
a
handsome
livery
stepped
a
pace
or
two
into
the
garden
well
said
henry
is
mr
henry
bannerworth
within
or
admiral
bell
both
cried
the
admiral
i'm
admiral
bell
and
this
is
mr
henry
bannerworth
what
do
you
want
with
us
you
d----d
gingerbread-looking
flunkey
sir
my
master
desires
his
compliments--his
very
best
compliments--and
he
wants
to
know
how
you
are
after
your
flurry
what
after
your--a--a--flurry
and
excitement
who
is
your
master
said
henry
sir
francis
varney
the
devil
said
the
admiral
if
that
don't
beat
all
the
impudence
i
ever
came
near
our
flurry
ah
i
like
that
fellow
just
go
and
tell
him--
no
no
said
henry
interposing
send
back
no
message
say
to
your
master
fellow
that
mr
henry
bannerworth
feels
that
not
only
has
he
no
claim
to
sir
francis
varney's
courtesy
but
that
he
would
rather
be
without
it
oh
ha
said
the
footman
adjusting
his
collar
very
good
this
seems
a
d----d
old-fashioned
outlandish
place
of
yours
any
ale
now
shiver
my
hulks
said
the
admiral
hush
hush
said
henry
who
knows
but
there
may
be
a
design
in
this
we
have
no
ale
oh
ah
dem--dry
as
dust
by
god
what
does
the
old
commodore
say
any
message
my
ancient
greek
no
thank
you
said
the
admiral
bless
you
nothing
what
did
you
give
for
that
waistcoat
d--n
you
ha
ha
you're
a
clever
fellow
ah
the
old
gentleman's
ill
however
i'll
take
back
his
compliments
and
that
he's
much
obliged
at
sir
francis's
condescension
at
the
same
time
i
suppose
may
place
in
my
eye
what
i
may
get
out
of
either
of
you
without
hindering
me
seeing
my
way
back
ha
ha
adieu--adieu
bravo
said
the
admiral
that's
it--go
it--now
for
it
d--n
it
it
is
a
do
the
admiral's
calmness
during
the
latter
part
of
the
dialogue
arose
from
the
fact
that
over
the
flunkey's
shoulder
and
at
some
little
distance
off
he
saw
jack
pringle
taking
off
his
jacket
and
rolling
up
his
sleeves
in
that
deliberate
sort
of
way
that
seemed
to
imply
a
determination
of
setting
about
some
species
of
work
that
combined
the
pleasant
with
the
useful
jack
executed
many
nods
to
and
winks
at
the
livery-servant
and
jerked
his
thumb
likewise
in
the
direction
of
a
pump
near
at
hand
in
a
manner
that
spoke
as
plainly
as
possible
that
john
was
to
be
pumped
upon
and
now
the
conference
was
ended
and
sir
francis's
messenger
turned
to
go
but
jack
pringle
bothered
him
completely
for
he
danced
round
him
in
such
a
singular
manner
that
turn
which
way
he
would
there
stood
jack
pringle
in
some
grotesque
attitude
intercepting
him
and
so
he
edged
him
on
till
he
got
him
to
the
pump
jack
said
the
admiral
ay
ay
sir
don't
pump
on
that
fellow
now
ay
ay
sir
give
us
a
hand
jack
laid
hold
of
him
by
the
two
ears
and
holding
him
under
the
pump
kicked
his
shins
until
he
completely
gathered
himself
beneath
the
spout
it
was
in
vain
that
he
shouted
murder
help
fire
thieves
jack
was
inexorable
and
the
admiral
pumped
jack
turned
the
fellow's
head
about
in
a
very
scientific
manner
so
as
to
give
him
a
fair
dose
of
hydropathic
treatment
and
in
a
few
minutes
never
was
human
being
more
thoroughly
saturated
with
moisture
than
was
sir
francis
varney's
servant
he
had
left
off
hallooing
for
aid
for
he
found
that
whenever
he
did
so
jack
held
his
mouth
under
the
spout
which
was
decidedly
unpleasant
so
with
a
patience
that
looked
like
heroic
fortitude
he
was
compelled
to
wait
until
the
admiral
was
tired
of
pumping
very
good
at
length
he
said
now
jack
for
fear
this
fellow
catcher
cold
be
so
good
as
to
get
a
horsewhip
and
see
him
off
the
premises
with
it
ay
ay
sir
said
jack
and
i
say
old
fellow
you
can
take
back
all
our
blessed
compliments
now
and
say
you've
been
flurried
a
little
yourself
and
if
so
be
as
you
came
here
as
dry
as
dust
d----e
you
go
back
as
wet
as
a
mop
won't
it
do
to
kick
him
out
sir
very
well--as
you
please
jack
then
here
goes
and
jack
proceeded
to
kick
the
shivering
animal
from
the
garden
with
a
vehemence
that
soon
convinced
him
of
the
necessity
of
getting
out
of
it
as
quickly
as
possible
how
it
was
that
sir
francis
varney
after
the
fearful
race
he
had
had
got
home
again
across
the
fields
free
from
all
danger
and
back
to
his
own
house
from
whence
he
sent
so
cool
and
insolent
a
message
they
could
not
conceive
but
such
must
certainly
be
the
fact
somehow
or
another
he
had
escaped
all
danger
and
with
a
calm
insolence
peculiar
to
the
man
he
had
no
doubt
adopted
the
present
mode
of
signifying
as
much
to
the
bannerworths
the
insolence
of
his
servant
was
no
doubt
a
matter
of
pre-arrangement
with
that
individual
however
he
might
have
set
about
it
con
amore
as
for
the
termination
of
the
adventure
that
of
course
had
not
been
at
all
calculated
upon
but
like
most
tools
of
other
people's
insolence
or
ambition
the
insolence
of
the
underling
had
received
both
his
own
punishment
and
his
master's
we
know
quite
enough
of
sir
francis
varney
to
feel
assured
that
he
would
rather
consider
it
as
a
good
jest
than
otherwise
of
his
footman
so
that
with
the
suffering
he
endured
at
the
bannerworths'
and
the
want
of
sympathy
he
was
likely
to
find
at
home
that
individual
had
certainly
nothing
to
congratulate
himself
upon
but
the
melancholy
reminiscence
of
his
own
cleverness
but
were
the
mob
satisfied
with
what
had
occurred
in
the
churchyard
they
were
not
and
that
night
was
to
witness
the
perpetration
of
a
melancholy
outrage
such
as
the
history
of
the
time
presents
no
parallel
to
the
finding
of
a
brick
in
the
coffin
of
the
butcher
instead
of
the
body
of
that
individual
soon
spread
as
a
piece
of
startling
intelligence
all
over
the
place
and
the
obvious
deduction
that
was
drawn
from
the
circumstance
seemed
to
be
that
the
deceased
butcher
was
unquestionably
a
vampyre
and
out
upon
some
expedition
at
the
time
when
his
coffin
was
searched
how
he
had
originally
got
out
of
that
receptacle
for
the
dead
was
certainly
a
mystery
but
the
story
was
none
the
worse
for
that
indeed
an
ingenious
individual
found
a
solution
for
that
part
of
the
business
for
as
he
said
nothing
was
more
natural
when
anybody
died
who
was
capable
of
becoming
a
vampyre
than
for
other
vampyres
who
knew
it
to
dig
him
up
and
lay
him
out
in
the
cold
beams
of
the
moonlight
until
he
acquired
the
same
sort
of
vitality
they
themselves
possessed
and
joined
their
horrible
fraternity
in
lieu
of
a
better
explanation--and
after
all
it
was
no
bad
one--this
theory
was
generally
received
and
with
a
shuddering
horror
people
asked
themselves
if
the
whole
of
the
churchyard
were
excavated
how
many
coffins
would
be
found
tenantless
by
the
dead
which
had
been
supposed
by
simple-minded
people
to
inhabit
them
the
presence
however
of
a
body
of
dragoons
towards
evening
effectually
prevented
any
renewed
attack
upon
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
churchyard
and
it
was
a
strange
and
startling
thing
to
see
that
country
town
under
military
surveillance
and
sentinels
posted
at
its
principal
buildings
this
measure
smothered
the
vengeance
of
the
crowd
and
insured
for
a
time
the
safety
of
sir
francis
varney
for
no
considerable
body
of
persons
could
assemble
for
the
purpose
of
attacking
his
house
again
without
being
followed
so
such
a
step
was
not
attempted
it
had
so
happened
however
that
on
that
very
day
the
funeral
of
a
young
man
was
to
have
taken
place
who
had
put
up
for
a
time
at
that
same
inn
where
admiral
bell
was
first
introduced
to
the
reader
he
had
become
seriously
ill
and
after
a
few
days
of
indisposition
which
had
puzzled
the
country
practitioners
breathed
his
last
he
was
to
have
been
buried
in
the
village
churchyard
on
the
very
day
of
the
riot
and
confusion
incidental
to
the
exhumation
of
the
coffin
of
the
butcher
and
probably
from
that
circumstance
we
may
deduce
the
presence
of
the
clergyman
in
canonicals
at
the
period
of
the
riot
when
it
was
found
that
so
disorderly
a
mob
possessed
the
churchyard
the
idea
of
burying
the
stranger
on
that
day
was
abandoned
but
still
all
would
have
gone
on
quietly
as
regarded
him
had
it
not
been
for
the
folly
of
one
of
the
chamber-maids
at
the
tavern
this
woman
with
all
the
love
of
gossip
incidental
to
her
class
had
from
the
first
entered
so
fully
into
all
the
particulars
concerning
vampyres
that
she
fairly
might
be
considered
to
be
a
little
deranged
on
that
head
her
imagination
had
been
so
worked
upon
that
she
was
in
an
unfit
state
to
think
of
anything
else
and
if
ever
upon
anybody
a
stern
and
revolting
superstition
was
calculated
to
produce
direful
effects
it
was
upon
this
woman
the
town
was
tolerably
quiet
the
presence
of
the
soldiery
had
frightened
some
and
amused
others
and
no
doubt
the
night
would
have
passed
off
serenely
had
she
not
suddenly
rushed
into
the
street
and
with
bewildered
accents
and
frantic
gestures
shouted--
a
vampyre--a
vampyre--a
vampyre
these
words
soon
collected
a
crowd
around
her
and
then
with
screaming
accents
which
would
have
been
quite
enough
to
convince
any
reflecting
person
that
she
had
actually
gone
distracted
upon
that
point
she
cried--
come
into
the
house--come
into
the
house
look
upon
the
dead
body
that
should
have
been
in
its
grave
it's
fresher
now
than
it
was
the
day
on
which
it
died
and
there's
a
colour
in
its
cheeks
a
vampyre--a
vampyre--a
vampyre
heaven
save
us
from
a
vampyre
the
strange
infuriated
maniacal
manner
in
which
these
words
were
uttered
produced
an
astonishingly
exciting
effect
among
the
mob
several
women
screamed
and
some
few
fainted
the
torch
was
laid
again
to
the
altar
of
popular
feeling
and
the
fierce
flame
of
superstition
burnt
brightly
and
fiercely
some
twenty
or
thirty
persons
with
shouts
and
exclamations
rushed
into
the
inn
while
the
woman
who
had
created
the
disturbance
still
continued
to
rave
tearing
her
hair
and
shrieking
at
intervals
until
she
fell
exhausted
upon
the
pavement
soon
from
a
hundred
throats
rose
the
dreadful
cry
of
a
vampyre--a
vampyre
the
alarm
was
given
throughout
the
whole
town
the
bugles
of
the
military
sounded
there
was
a
clash
of
arms--the
shrieks
of
women
altogether
the
premonitory
symptoms
of
such
a
riot
as
was
not
likely
to
be
quelled
without
bloodshed
and
considerable
disaster
it
is
truly
astonishing
the
effect
which
one
weak
or
vicious-minded
person
can
produce
upon
a
multitude
here
was
a
woman
whose
opinion
would
have
been
accounted
valueless
upon
the
most
common-place
subject
and
whose
word
would
not
have
passed
for
twopence
setting
a
whole
town
by
the
ears
by
force
of
nothing
but
her
sheer
brutal
ignorance
it
is
a
notorious
physiological
fact
that
after
four
or
five
days
or
even
a
week
the
bodies
of
many
persons
assume
an
appearance
of
freshness
such
as
might
have
been
looked
for
in
vain
immediately
after
death
it
is
one
of
the
most
insidious
processes
of
that
decay
which
appears
to
regret
with
its
-----------
offensive
fingers
to
mar
the
lines
where
beauty
lingers
but
what
did
the
chamber-maid
know
of
physiology
probably
she
would
have
asked
if
it
was
anything
good
to
eat
and
so
of
course
having
her
head
full
of
vampyres
she
must
needs
produce
so
lamentable
a
scene
of
confusion
the
results
of
which
we
almost
sicken
at
detailing
the
stake
and
the
dead
body
illustration
the
mob
seemed
from
the
first
to
have
an
impression
that
as
regarded
the
military
force
no
very
serious
results
would
arise
from
that
quarter
for
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
on
an
occasion
which
could
not
possibly
arouse
any
ill
blood
on
the
part
of
the
soldiery
or
on
which
they
could
have
the
least
personal
feeling
they
would
like
to
get
a
bad
name
which
would
stick
to
them
for
years
to
come
it
was
no
political
riot
on
which
men
might
be
supposed
in
consequence
of
differing
in
opinion
to
have
their
passions
inflamed
so
that
although
the
call
of
the
civil
authorities
for
military
aid
had
been
acceded
to
yet
it
was
hoped
and
indeed
almost
understood
by
the
officers
that
their
operations
would
lie
confined
more
to
a
demonstration
of
power
than
anything
else
besides
some
of
the
men
had
got
talking
to
the
townspeople
and
had
heard
all
about
the
vampyre
story
and
not
being
of
the
most
refined
or
educated
class
themselves
they
felt
rather
interested
than
otherwise
in
the
affair
under
these
circumstances
then
we
are
inclined
to
think
that
the
disorderly
mob
of
that
inn
had
not
so
wholesome
a
fear
as
it
was
most
certainly
intended
they
should
have
of
the
redcoats
then
again
they
were
not
attacking
the
churchyard
which
in
the
first
case
was
the
main
point
in
dispute
and
about
which
the
authorities
had
felt
so
very
sore
inasmuch
as
they
felt
that
if
once
the
common
people
found
out
that
the
sanctity
of
such
places
could
be
outraged
with
impunity
they
would
lose
their
reverence
for
the
church
that
is
to
say
for
the
host
of
persons
who
live
well
and
get
fat
in
this
country
by
the
trade
of
religion
illustration
consequently
this
churchyard
was
the
main
point
of
defence
and
it
was
zealously
looked
to
when
it
need
not
have
been
done
so
while
the
public-house
where
there
really
reigned
mischief
was
half
unguarded
there
are
always
in
all
communities
whether
large
or
small
a
number
of
persons
who
really
have
or
fancy
they
have
something
to
gain
by
disturbance
these
people
of
course
care
not
for
what
pretext
the
public
peace
is
violated
so
long
as
there
is
a
row
and
something
like
an
excuse
for
running
into
other
people's
houses
they
are
satisfied
to
get
into
a
public-house
under
such
circumstances
is
an
unexpected
treat
and
thus
when
the
mob
rushed
into
the
inn
with
such
symptoms
of
fury
and
excitement
there
went
with
the
leaders
of
the
disturbance
a
number
of
persons
who
never
thought
of
getting
further
than
the
bar
where
they
attacked
the
spirit-taps
with
an
alacrity
which
showed
how
great
was
their
love
for
ardent
compounds
leaving
these
persons
behind
however
we
will
follow
those
who
with
a
real
superstition
and
a
furious
interest
in
the
affair
of
the
vampyre
made
their
way
towards
the
upper
chamber
determining
to
satisfy
themselves
if
there
were
truth
in
the
statement
so
alarmingly
made
by
the
woman
who
had
created
such
an
emotion
it
is
astonishing
what
people
will
do
in
crowds
in
comparison
with
the
acts
that
they
would
be
able
to
commit
individually
there
is
usually
a
calmness
a
sanctity
a
sublimity
about
death
which
irresistibly
induces
a
respect
for
its
presence
alike
from
the
educated
or
from
the
illiterate
and
let
the
object
of
the
fell-destroyer's
presence
be
whom
it
may
the
very
consciousness
that
death
has
claimed
it
for
its
own
invests
it
with
a
halo
of
respect
that
in
life
the
individual
could
never
aspire
to
probably
let
us
precede
these
furious
rioters
for
a
few
moments
and
look
upon
the
chamber
of
the
dead--that
chamber
which
for
a
whole
week
had
been
looked
upon
with
a
kind
of
shuddering
terror--that
chamber
which
had
been
darkened
by
having
its
sources
of
light
closed
as
if
it
were
a
kind
of
disrespect
to
the
dead
to
allow
the
pleasant
sunshine
to
fall
upon
the
faded
form
and
every
inhabitant
of
that
house
upon
ascending
and
descending
its
intricate
and
ancient
staircases
had
walked
with
a
quiet
and
subdued
step
past
that
one
particular
door
even
the
tones
of
voice
in
which
they
spoke
to
each
other
while
they
knew
that
that
sad
remnant
of
mortality
was
in
the
house
was
quiet
and
subdued
as
if
the
repose
of
death
was
but
a
mortal
sleep
and
could
be
broken
by
rude
sounds
ay
even
some
of
these
very
persons
who
now
with
loud
and
boisterous
clamour
had
rushed
into
the
place
had
visited
the
house
and
talked
in
whispers
but
then
they
were
alone
and
men
will
do
in
throngs
acts
which
individually
they
would
shrink
from
with
compunction
or
cowardice
call
it
which
we
will
the
chamber
of
death
is
upon
the
second
story
of
the
house
it
is
a
back
room
the
windows
of
which
command
a
view
of
that
half
garden
half
farm-yard
which
we
find
generally
belonging
to
country
inns
but
now
the
shutters
were
closed
with
the
exception
of
one
small
opening
that
in
daylight
would
have
admitted
a
straggling
ray
of
light
to
fall
upon
the
corpse
now
however
that
the
sombre
shades
of
evening
had
wrapped
everything
in
gloom
the
room
appeared
in
total
darkness
so
that
the
most
of
those
adventurers
who
had
ventured
into
the
place
shrunk
back
until
lights
were
procured
from
the
lower
part
of
the
house
with
which
to
enter
the
room
a
dim
oil
lamp
in
a
niche
sufficiently
lighted
the
staircase
and
by
the
friendly
aid
of
its
glimmering
beams
they
had
found
their
way
up
to
the
landing
tolerably
well
and
had
not
thought
of
the
necessity
of
having
lights
with
which
to
enter
the
apartments
until
they
found
them
in
utter
darkness
these
requisites
however
were
speedily
procured
from
the
kitchen
of
the
inn
indeed
anything
that
was
wanted
was
laid
hold
of
without
the
least
word
of
remark
to
the
people
of
the
place
as
if
might
from
that
evening
forthwith
was
understood
to
constitute
right
in
that
town
up
to
this
point
no
one
had
taken
a
very
prominent
part
in
the
attack
upon
the
inn
if
attack
it
could
be
called
but
now
the
man
whom
chance
or
his
own
nimbleness
made
the
first
of
the
throng
assumed
to
himself
a
sort
of
control
over
his
companions
and
turning
to
them
he
said--
hark
ye
my
friends
we'll
do
everything
quietly
and
properly
so
i
think
we'd
better
three
or
four
of
us
go
in
at
once
arm-in-arm
psha
cried
one
who
had
just
arrived
with
a
light
it's
your
cowardice
that
speaks
i'll
go
in
first
let
those
follow
me
who
like
and
those
who
are
afraid
may
remain
where
they
are
he
at
once
dashed
into
the
room
and
this
immediately
broke
the
spell
of
fear
which
was
beginning
to
creep
over
the
others
in
consequence
of
the
timid
suggestion
of
the
man
who
up
to
that
moment
had
been
first
and
foremost
in
the
enterprise
in
an
instant
the
chamber
was
half
filled
with
persons
four
or
five
of
whom
carried
lights
so
that
as
it
was
not
of
very
large
dimensions
it
was
sufficiently
illuminated
for
every
object
in
it
to
be
clearly
visible
there
was
the
bed
smooth
and
unruffled
as
if
waiting
for
some
expected
guest
while
close
by
its
side
a
coffin
supported
upon
tressles
over
which
a
sheet
was
partially
thrown
contained
the
sad
remains
of
him
who
little
expected
in
life
that
after
death
he
should
be
stigmatised
as
an
example
of
one
of
the
ghastliest
superstitions
that
ever
found
a
home
in
the
human
imagination
it
was
evident
that
some
one
had
been
in
the
room
and
that
this
was
the
woman
whose
excited
fancy
had
led
her
to
look
upon
the
face
of
the
corpse
there
could
be
no
doubt
for
the
sheet
was
drawn
aside
just
sufficiently
to
discover
the
countenance
the
fact
was
that
the
stranger
was
unknown
at
the
inn
or
probably
ere
this
the
coffin
lid
would
have
been
screwed
on
but
it
was
hoped
up
to
the
last
moment
as
advertisements
had
been
put
into
the
county
papers
that
some
one
would
come
forward
to
identify
and
claim
him
such
however
had
not
been
the
case
and
so
his
funeral
had
been
determined
upon
the
presence
of
so
many
persons
at
once
effectually
prevented
any
individual
from
exhibiting
even
if
he
felt
any
superstitious
fears
about
approaching
the
coffin
and
so
with
one
accord
they
surrounded
it
and
looked
upon
the
face
of
the
dead
there
was
nothing
repulsive
in
that
countenance
the
fact
was
that
decomposition
had
sufficiently
advanced
to
induce
a
relaxation
of
the
muscles
and
a
softening
of
the
fibres
so
that
an
appearance
of
calmness
and
repose
had
crept
over
the
face
which
it
did
not
wear
immediately
after
death
it
happened
too
that
the
face
was
full
of
flesh--for
the
death
had
been
sudden
and
there
had
not
been
that
wasting
away
of
the
muscles
and
integuments
which
makes
the
skin
cling
as
it
were
to
the
bone
when
the
ravages
of
long
disease
have
exhausted
the
physical
frame
there
was
unquestionably
a
plumpness
a
freshness
and
a
sort
of
vitality
about
the
countenance
that
was
remarkable
for
a
few
moments
there
was
a
death-like
stillness
in
the
apartment
and
then
one
voice
broke
the
silence
by
exclaiming--
he's
a
vampyre
and
has
come
here
to
die
well
he
knows
he'd
be
taken
up
by
sir
francis
varney
and
become
one
of
the
crew
yes
yes
cried
several
voices
at
once
a
vampyre
a
vampyre
hold
a
moment
cried
one
let
us
find
somebody
in
the
house
who
has
seen
him
some
days
ago
and
then
we
can
ascertain
if
there's
any
difference
in
his
looks
this
suggestion
was
agreed
to
and
a
couple
of
stout
men
ran
down
stairs
and
returned
in
a
few
moments
with
a
trembling
waiter
whom
they
had
caught
in
the
passage
and
forced
to
accompany
them
this
man
seemed
to
think
that
he
was
to
be
made
a
dreadful
example
of
in
some
sort
of
way
and
as
he
was
dragged
into
the
room
he
trembled
and
looked
as
pale
as
death
what
have
i
done
gentlemen
he
said
i
ain't
a
vampyre
don't
be
driving
a
stake
through
me
i
assure
you
gentlemen
i'm
only
a
waiter
and
have
been
for
a
matter
of
five-and-twenty
years
you'll
be
done
no
harm
to
said
one
of
his
captors
you've
only
got
to
answer
a
question
that
will
be
put
to
you
oh
well
certainly
gentlemen
anything
you
please
coming--coming
as
i
always
say
give
your
orders
the
waiter's
in
the
room
look
upon
the
fare
of
that
corpse
certainly
certainly--directly
have
you
ever
seen
it
before
seen
it
before
lord
bless
you
yes
a
dozen
of
times
i
seed
him
afore
he
died
and
i
seed
him
arter
and
when
the
undertaker's
men
came
i
came
up
with
them
and
i
seed
'em
put
him
in
his
coffin
you
see
i
kept
an
eye
on
'em
gentlemen
'cos
knows
well
enough
what
they
is
a
cousin
of
mine
was
in
the
trade
and
he
assures
me
as
one
of
'em
always
brings
a
tooth-drawing
concern
in
his
pocket
and
looks
in
the
mouth
of
the
blessed
corpse
to
see
if
there's
a
blessed
tooth
worth
pulling
out
hold
your
tongue
said
one
we
want
none
of
your
nonsense
do
you
see
any
difference
now
in
the
face
of
the
corpse
to
what
it
was
some
days
since
well
i
don't
know
somehow
it
don't
look
so
rum
does
it
look
fresher
well
somehow
or
another
now
you
mention
it
it's
very
odd
but
it
does
enough
cried
the
man
who
had
questioned
him
with
considerable
excitement
of
manner
neighbours
are
we
to
have
our
wives
and
our
children
scared
to
death
by
vampyres
no--no
cried
everybody
is
not
this
then
one
of
that
dreadful
order
of
beings
yes--yes
what's
to
be
done
drive
a
stake
through
the
body
and
so
prevent
the
possibility
of
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
restoration
this
was
a
terrific
proposition
and
even
those
who
felt
most
strongly
upon
the
subject
and
had
their
fears
most
awakened
shrank
from
carrying
it
into
effect
others
again
applauded
it
although
they
determined
in
their
own
minds
to
keep
far
enough
off
from
the
execution
of
the
job
which
they
hoped
would
devolve
upon
others
so
that
they
might
have
all
the
security
of
feeling
that
such
a
process
had
been
gone
through
with
the
supposed
vampyre
without
being
in
any
way
committed
by
the
dreadful
act
nothing
was
easier
than
to
procure
a
stake
from
the
garden
in
the
rear
of
the
premises
but
it
was
one
thing
to
have
the
means
at
hand
of
carrying
into
effect
so
dreadful
a
proposition
and
another
actually
to
do
it
for
the
credit
of
human
nature
we
regret
that
even
then
when
civilisation
and
popular
education
had
by
no
means
made
such
rapid
strides
as
in
our
times
they
have
such
a
proposition
should
be
entertained
for
a
moment
but
so
it
was
and
just
as
an
alarm
was
given
that
a
party
of
the
soldiers
had
reached
the
inn
and
had
taken
possession
of
the
doorway
with
a
determination
to
arrest
the
rioters
a
strong
hedge-stake
had
been
procured
and
everything
was
in
readiness
for
the
perpetration
of
the
horrible
deed
even
then
those
in
the
room
for
they
were
tolerably
sober
would
have
revolted
probably
from
the
execution
of
so
fearful
an
act
but
the
entrance
of
a
party
of
the
military
into
the
lower
portion
of
the
tavern
induced
those
who
had
been
making
free
with
the
strong
liquors
below
to
make
a
rush
up-stairs
to
their
companions
with
the
hope
of
escaping
detection
of
the
petty
larceny
if
they
got
into
trouble
on
account
of
the
riot
these
persons
infuriated
by
drink
were
capable
of
anything
and
to
them
accordingly
the
more
sober
parties
gladly
surrendered
the
disagreeable
job
of
rendering
the
supposed
vampyre
perfectly
innoxious
by
driving
a
hedge-stake
through
his
body--a
proceeding
which
it
was
currently
believed
inflicted
so
much
physical
injury
to
the
frame
as
to
render
his
resuscitation
out
of
the
question
the
cries
of
alarm
from
below
joined
now
to
the
shouts
of
those
mad
rioters
produced
a
scene
of
dreadful
confusion
we
cannot
for
we
revolt
at
the
office
describe
particularly
the
dreadful
outrage
which
was
committed
upon
the
corpse
suffice
it
that
two
or
three
maddened
by
drink
and
incited
by
the
others
plunged
the
hedge-stake
through
the
body
and
there
left
it
a
sickening
and
horrible
spectacle
to
any
one
who
might
cast
his
eyes
upon
it
with
such
violence
had
the
frightful
and
inhuman
deed
been
committed
that
the
bottom
of
the
coffin
was
perforated
by
the
stake
so
that
the
corpse
was
actually
nailed
to
its
last
earthly
tenement
some
asserted
that
at
that
moment
an
audible
groan
came
from
the
dead
man
and
that
this
arose
from
the
extinguishment
of
that
remnant
of
life
which
remained
in
him
on
account
of
his
being
a
vampyre
and
which
would
have
been
brought
into
full
existence
if
the
body
had
been
placed
in
the
rays
of
the
moon
when
at
its
full
according
to
the
popular
superstition
upon
that
subject
others
again
were
quite
ready
to
swear
that
at
the
moment
the
stake
was
used
there
was
a
visible
convulsion
of
all
the
limbs
and
that
the
countenance
before
so
placid
and
so
calm
became
immediately
distorted
as
if
with
agony
but
we
have
done
with
these
horrible
surmises
the
dreadful
deed
has
been
committed
and
wild
ungovernable
superstition
has
had
for
a
time
its
sway
over
the
ignorant
and
debased
the
mob's
arrival
at
sir
francis
varney's--the
attempt
to
gain
admission
illustration
the
soldiery
had
been
sent
for
from
their
principal
station
near
the
churchyard
and
had
advanced
with
some
degree
of
reluctance
to
quell
what
they
considered
as
nothing
better
nor
worse
than
a
drunken
brawl
at
a
public-house
which
they
really
considered
they
ought
not
to
be
called
to
interfere
with
when
however
the
party
reached
the
spot
and
heard
what
a
confusion
there
was
and
saw
in
what
numbers
the
rioters
were
assembling
it
became
evident
to
them
that
the
case
was
of
a
more
serious
complexion
than
they
had
at
first
imagined
and
consequently
they
felt
that
their
professional
dignity
was
not
so
much
compromised
with
their
interference
with
the
lawless
proceedings
some
of
the
constabulary
of
the
town
were
there
and
to
them
the
soldiers
promised
they
would
hand
what
prisoners
they
took
at
the
same
time
that
they
made
a
distinct
condition
that
they
were
not
to
be
troubled
with
their
custody
nor
in
any
way
further
annoyed
in
the
business
beyond
taking
care
that
they
did
not
absolutely
escape
after
being
once
secured
this
was
all
that
the
civil
authorities
of
the
town
required
and
in
fact
they
hoped
that
after
making
prisoners
of
a
few
of
the
ringleaders
of
the
riotous
proceedings
the
rest
would
disperse
and
prevent
the
necessity
of
capturing
them
be
it
known
however
that
both
military
and
civil
authorities
were
completely
ignorant
of
the
dreadful
outrage
against
all
common
decency
which
had
been
committed
within
the
public-house
the
door
was
well
guarded
and
the
question
now
was
how
the
rioters
were
to
be
made
to
come
down
stairs
and
be
captured
and
this
was
likely
to
remain
a
question
so
long
as
no
means
were
adopted
to
make
them
descend
so
that
after
a
time
it
was
agreed
that
a
couple
of
troopers
should
march
up
stairs
with
a
constable
to
enable
him
to
secure
any
one
who
seemed
a
principal
in
the
riot
but
this
only
had
the
effect
of
driving
those
who
were
in
the
second-floor
and
saw
the
approach
of
the
two
soldiers
whom
they
thought
were
backed
by
the
whole
of
their
comrades
up
a
narrow
staircase
to
a
third-floor
rather
consisting
of
lofts
than
of
actual
rooms
but
still
for
the
time
it
was
a
refuge
and
owing
to
the
extreme
narrowness
of
the
approach
to
it
which
consisted
of
nearly
a
perpendicular
staircase
with
any
degree
of
tact
or
method
it
might
have
been
admirably
defended
in
the
hurry
and
scramble
all
the
lights
were
left
behind
and
when
the
two
soldiers
and
constables
entered
the
room
where
the
corpse
had
lain
they
became
for
the
first
time
aware
of
what
a
horrible
purpose
had
been
carried
out
by
the
infuriated
mob
the
sight
was
one
of
perfect
horror
and
hardened
to
scenes
which
might
strike
other
people
as
being
somewhat
of
the
terrific
as
these
soldiers
might
be
supposed
to
be
by
their
very
profession
they
actually
sickened
at
the
sight
which
the
mutilated
corpse
presented
and
turned
aside
with
horror
these
feelings
soon
gave
way
to
anger
and
animosity
against
the
crowd
who
could
be
guilty
of
such
an
atrocious
outrage
and
for
the
first
time
a
strong
and
interested
vengeance
against
the
mob
pervaded
the
breasts
of
those
who
were
brought
to
act
against
it
one
of
the
soldiers
ran
down
stairs
to
the
door
and
reported
the
scene
which
was
to
be
seen
above
a
determination
was
instantly
come
to
to
capture
as
many
as
possible
of
those
who
had
been
concerned
in
so
diabolical
an
outrage
and
leaving
a
guard
of
five
men
at
the
door
the
remainder
of
the
party
ascended
the
staircase
determined
upon
storming
the
last
refuge
of
the
rioters
and
dragging
them
to
justice
the
report
however
of
these
proceedings
that
were
taking
place
at
the
inn
spread
quickly
over
the
whole
town
and
soon
as
large
a
mob
of
the
disorderly
and
the
idle
as
the
place
could
at
all
afford
was
assembled
outside
the
inn
this
mob
appeared
for
a
time
inertly
to
watch
the
proceedings
it
seemed
rather
a
hazardous
thing
to
interfere
with
the
soldiers
whose
carbines
look
formidable
and
troublesome
weapons
with
true
mob
courage
therefore
they
left
the
minority
of
their
comrades
who
were
within
the
house
to
their
fate
and
after
a
whispered
conference
from
one
to
the
other
they
suddenly
turned
in
a
body
and
began
to
make
for
the
outskirts
of
the
town
they
then
separated
as
if
by
common
consent
and
straggled
out
into
the
open
country
by
twos
and
threes
consolidating
again
into
a
mass
when
they
had
got
some
distance
off
and
clear
of
any
exertions
that
could
be
made
by
the
soldiery
to
stay
them
the
cry
then
rose
of
down
with
sir
francis
varney--slay
him--burn
his
house--death
to
all
vampyres
and
at
a
rapid
pace
they
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
his
mansion
we
will
leave
this
mob
however
for
the
present
and
turn
our
attention
to
those
who
are
at
the
inn
and
are
certainly
in
a
position
of
some
jeopardy
their
numbers
were
not
great
and
they
were
unarmed
certainly
their
best
chance
would
have
been
to
have
surrendered
at
discretion
but
that
was
a
measure
which
if
the
sober
ones
had
felt
inclined
to
those
who
were
infuriated
and
half
maddened
with
drink
would
not
have
acceded
to
on
any
account
a
furious
resistance
was
therefore
fairly
to
be
expected
and
what
means
the
soldiery
were
likely
to
use
for
the
purpose
of
storming
this
last
retreat
was
a
matter
of
rather
anxious
conjecture
in
the
case
of
a
regular
enemy
there
would
not
perhaps
have
been
much
difficulty
but
here
the
capture
of
certain
persons
and
not
their
destruction
was
the
object
and
how
that
was
to
be
accomplished
by
fair
means
certainly
was
a
question
which
nobody
felt
very
competent
to
solve
determination
however
will
do
wonders
and
although
the
rioters
numbered
over
forty
notwithstanding
all
their
desertions
and
not
above
seventeen
or
eighteen
soldiers
marched
into
the
inn
we
shall
perceive
that
they
succeeded
in
accomplishing
their
object
without
any
manoeuvring
at
all
the
space
in
which
the
rioters
were
confined
was
low
narrow
and
inconvenient
as
well
as
dark
for
the
lights
on
the
staircase
cast
up
that
height
but
very
insufficient
rays
weapons
of
defence
they
found
but
very
few
and
yet
there
were
some
which
to
do
them
but
common
credit
they
used
as
effectually
as
possible
these
attics
or
lofts
were
used
as
lumber-rooms
and
had
been
so
for
years
so
that
there
was
a
collection
of
old
boxes
broken
pieces
of
furniture
and
other
matters
which
will
in
defiance
of
everything
and
everybody
collect
in
a
house
these
were
formidable
means
of
defence
if
not
of
offence
down
a
very
narrow
staircase
had
they
been
used
with
judgment
some
of
the
rioters
who
were
only
just
drunk
enough
to
be
fool-hardy
collected
a
few
of
these
articles
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
swore
they
would
smash
anybody
who
should
attempt
to
come
up
to
them
a
threat
easier
uttered
than
executed
and
besides
after
all
if
their
position
had
been
ever
so
impregnable
they
must
come
down
eventually
or
be
starved
out
but
the
soldiers
were
not
at
liberty
to
adopt
so
slow
a
process
of
overcoming
their
enemy
and
up
the
second-floor
staircase
they
went
with
a
determination
of
making
short
work
of
the
business
they
paused
a
moment
by
word
of
command
on
the
landing
and
then
after
this
slight
pause
the
word
was
given
to
advance
now
when
men
will
advance
in
spite
of
anything
and
everything
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
stop
them
and
he
who
was
foremost
among
the
military
would
as
soon
thought
of
hesitating
to
ascend
the
narrow
staircase
before
him
when
ordered
so
to
do
as
paying
the
national
debt
on
he
went
and
down
came
a
great
chest
which
falling
against
his
feet
knocked
him
down
as
he
attempted
to
scramble
over
it
fire
said
the
officer
and
it
appeared
that
he
had
made
some
arrangements
as
to
how
the
order
was
to
be
obeyed
for
the
second
man
fired
his
carbine
and
then
scrambled
over
his
prostrate
comrade
after
which
he
stooped
and
the
third
fired
his
carbine
likewise
and
then
hurried
forward
in
the
same
manner
at
the
first
sound
of
the
fire
arms
the
rioters
were
taken
completely
by
surprise
they
had
not
had
the
least
notion
of
affairs
getting
to
such
a
length
the
smell
of
the
powder
the
loud
report
and
the
sensation
of
positive
danger
that
accompanied
these
phenomena
alarmed
them
most
terrifically
so
that
in
point
of
fact
with
the
exception
of
the
empty
chest
that
was
thrown
down
in
the
way
of
the
first
soldier
no
further
idea
of
defence
seemed
in
any
way
to
find
a
place
in
the
hearts
of
the
besieged
they
scrambled
one
over
the
other
in
their
eagerness
to
get
as
far
as
possible
from
immediate
danger
which
of
course
they
conceived
existed
in
the
most
imminent
degree
the
nearest
to
the
door
such
was
the
state
of
terror
into
which
they
were
thrown
that
each
one
at
the
moment
believed
himself
shot
and
the
soldiers
had
overcome
all
the
real
difficulties
in
getting
possession
of
what
might
thus
be
called
the
citadel
of
the
inn
before
those
men
who
had
been
so
valorous
a
short
time
since
recovered
from
the
tremendous
fright
into
which
they
had
been
thrown
we
need
hardly
say
that
the
carbines
were
loaded
but
with
blank
cartridges
for
there
was
neither
a
disposition
nor
a
necessity
for
taking
the
lives
of
these
misguided
people
if
was
the
suddenness
and
the
steadiness
of
the
attack
that
had
done
all
the
mischief
to
their
cause
and
now
ere
they
recovered
from
the
surprise
of
having
their
position
so
completely
taken
by
storm
they
were
handed
down
stairs
one
by
one
from
soldier
to
soldier
and
into
the
custody
of
the
civil
authorities
in
order
to
secure
the
safe
keeping
of
large
a
body
of
prisoners
the
constables
who
were
in
a
great
minority
placed
handcuffs
upon
some
of
the
most
capable
of
resistance
so
what
with
those
who
were
thus
secured
and
those
who
were
terrified
into
submission
there
was
not
a
man
of
all
the
lot
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
attics
of
the
public-house
but
was
a
prisoner
at
the
sound
of
fire-arms
the
women
who
were
outside
the
inn
had
of
course
raised
a
most
prodigious
clamour
they
believed
directly
that
every
bullet
must
have
done
some
most
serious
mischief
to
the
townspeople
and
it
was
only
upon
one
of
the
soldiers
a
non-commissioned
officer
who
was
below
assuring
them
of
the
innoxious
nature
of
the
proceeding
which
restored
anything
like
equanimity
silence
he
cried
what
are
you
howling
about
do
you
fancy
that
we've
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
shoot
a
parcel
of
fellows
that
are
not
worth
the
bullets
that
would
be
lodged
in
their
confounded
carcases
but
we
heard
the
gun
said
a
woman
of
course
you
did
it's
the
powder
that
makes
the
noise
not
the
bullet
you'll
see
them
all
brought
out
safe
wind
and
limb
this
assurance
satisfied
the
women
to
a
certain
extent
and
such
had
been
their
fear
that
they
should
have
had
to
look
upon
the
spectacle
of
death
or
of
grievous
wounds
that
they
were
comparatively
quite
satisfied
when
they
saw
husbands
fathers
and
brothers
only
in
the
custody
of
the
town
officers
and
very
sheepish
some
of
the
fellows
looked
when
they
were
handed
down
and
handcuffed
and
the
more
especially
when
they
had
been
routed
only
by
a
few
blank
cartridges--that
sixpenny
worth
of
powder
had
defeated
them
they
were
marched
off
to
the
town
gaol
guarded
by
the
military
who
now
probably
fancied
that
their
night's
work
was
over
and
that
the
most
turbulent
and
troublesome
spirits
in
the
town
had
been
secured
such
however
was
not
the
case
for
no
sooner
had
comparative
order
been
restored
than
common
observation
pointed
to
a
dull
red
glare
in
the
southern
sky
in
a
few
more
minutes
there
came
in
stragglers
from
the
open
country
shouting
fire
fire
with
all
their
might
the
mob's
arrival
at
sir
francis
varney's--the
attempt
to
gain
admission
illustration
all
eyes
were
directed
towards
that
southern
sky
which
each
moment
was
becoming
more
and
more
illuminated
by
the
lurid
appearance
bespeaking
a
conflagration
which
if
it
was
not
extensive
at
all
events
was
raging
fiercely
there
came
too
upon
the
wind
which
set
from
that
direction
strange
sounds
resembling
shouts
of
triumph
combined
occasionally
with
sharper
cries
indicative
of
alarm
with
so
much
system
and
so
quietly
had
this
attack
been
made
upon
the
house
of
sir
francis
varney--for
the
consequences
of
it
now
exhibited
themselves
most
unequivocally--that
no
one
who
had
not
actually
accompanied
the
expedition
was
in
the
least
aware
that
it
had
been
at
all
undertaken
or
that
anything
of
the
kind
was
on
the
tapis
now
however
it
could
be
no
longer
kept
a
secret
and
as
the
infuriated
mob
who
had
sought
this
flagrant
means
of
giving
vent
to
their
anger
saw
the
flames
from
the
blazing
house
rising
high
in
the
heavens
they
felt
convinced
that
further
secrecy
was
out
of
the
question
accordingly
in
such
cries
and
shouts
as--but
for
caution's
sake--they
would
have
indulged
in
from
the
very
first
they
now
gave
utterance
to
their
feelings
as
regarded
the
man
whose
destruction
was
aimed
at
death
to
the
vampyre--death
to
the
vampyre
was
the
principal
shout
and
it
was
uttered
in
tones
which
sounded
like
those
of
rage
and
disappointment
but
it
is
necessary
now
that
we
have
disposed
of
the
smaller
number
of
rioters
who
committed
so
serious
an
outrage
at
the
inn
that
we
should
with
some
degree
of
method
follow
the
proceedings
of
the
larger
number
who
went
from
the
town
towards
sir
francis
varney's
these
persons
either
had
information
of
a
very
positive
nature
or
a
very
strong
suspicion
that
notwithstanding
the
mysterious
and
most
unaccountable
disappearance
of
the
vampyre
in
the
old
ruin
he
would
now
be
found
as
usual
at
his
own
residence
perhaps
one
of
his
own
servants
may
have
thus
played
the
traitor
to
him
but
however
it
was
there
certainly
was
an
air
of
confidence
about
some
of
the
leaders
of
the
tumultuous
assemblage
that
induced
a
general
belief
that
this
time
at
least
the
vampyre
would
not
escape
popular
vengeance
for
being
what
he
was
we
have
before
noticed
that
these
people
went
out
of
the
town
at
different
points
and
did
not
assemble
into
one
mass
until
they
were
at
a
sufficient
distance
off
to
be
free
from
all
fear
of
observation
then
some
of
the
less
observant
and
cautious
of
them
began
to
indulge
in
shouts
of
rage
and
defiance
but
those
who
placed
themselves
foremost
succeeded
in
procuring
a
halt
and
one
said--
good
friends
all
if
we
make
any
noise
it
can
only
have
one
effect
and
that
is
to
warn
sir
francis
varney
and
enable
him
to
escape
if
therefore
we
cannot
go
on
quietly
i
propose
that
we
return
to
our
homes
for
we
shall
accomplish
nothing
this
advice
was
sufficiently
and
evidently
reasonable
to
meet
with
no
dissension
a
death-like
stillness
ensued
only
broken
by
some
two
or
three
voices
saying
in
subdued
tones--
that's
right--that's
right
nobody
speak
come
on
then
said
he
who
had
given
such
judicious
counsel
and
the
dark
mass
of
men
moved
towards
sir
francis
varney's
house
as
quietly
as
it
was
possible
for
such
an
assemblage
to
proceed
indeed
saving
the
sound
of
the
footsteps
nothing
could
be
heard
of
them
at
all
and
that
regular
tramp
tramp
would
have
puzzled
any
one
listening
to
it
from
any
distance
to
know
in
which
direction
it
was
proceeding
in
this
way
they
went
on
until
sir
francis
varney's
house
was
reached
and
then
a
whispered
word
to
halt
was
given
and
all
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
building
from
but
one
window
out
of
the
numerous
ones
with
which
the
front
of
the
mansion
was
studded
did
there
shine
the
least
light
and
from
that
there
came
rather
an
uncommonly
bright
reflection
probably
arising
from
a
reading
lamp
placed
close
to
the
window
a
general
impression
they
knew
not
why
exactly
seemed
to
pervade
everybody
that
in
the
room
from
whence
streamed
that
bright
light
was
sir
francis
varney
the
vampyre's
room
said
several
the
vampyre's
room
that
is
it
yes
said
he
who
had
a
kind
of
moral
control
over
his
comrades
i
have
no
doubt
but
he
is
there
what's
to
be
done
asked
several
make
no
noise
whatever
but
stand
aside
so
as
not
to
be
seen
from
the
door
when
it
is
opened
yes
yes
i
will
knock
for
admittance
and
the
moment
it
is
answered
i
will
place
this
stick
in
such
a
manner
within
that
the
door
cannot
be
closed
again
upon
my
saying
'advance'
you
will
make
a
rush
forward
and
we
shall
have
possession
immediately
of
the
house
all
this
was
agreed
to
the
mob
slunk
close
to
the
walls
of
the
house
and
out
of
immediate
observation
from
the
hall
door
or
from
any
of
the
windows
and
then
the
leader
advanced
and
knocked
loudly
for
admission
the
silence
was
now
of
the
most
complete
character
that
could
be
imagined
those
who
came
there
so
bent
upon
vengeance
were
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
extreme
caution
to
save
themselves
even
yet
from
being
completely
foiled
they
had
abundant
faith
from
experience
of
the
resources
in
the
way
of
escape
of
sir
francis
varney
and
not
one
among
them
was
there
who
considered
that
there
was
any
chance
of
capturing
him
except
by
surprise
and
when
once
they
got
hold
of
him
they
determined
he
should
not
easily
slip
through
their
fingers
the
knock
for
admission
produced
no
effect
and
after
waiting
three
or
four
minutes
it
was
very
provoking
to
find
such
a
wonderful
amount
of
caution
and
cunning
completely
thrown
away
try
again
whispered
one
well
have
patience
i
am
going
to
try
again
the
man
had
the
ponderous
old-fashioned
knocker
in
his
hand
and
was
about
to
make
another
appeal
to
sir
francis
varney's
door
when
a
strange
voice
said--
perhaps
you
may
as
well
say
at
once
what
you
want
instead
of
knocking
there
to
no
purpose
he
gave
a
start
for
the
voice
seemed
to
come
from
the
very
door
itself
yet
it
sounded
decidedly
human
and
upon
a
closer
inspection
it
was
seen
that
a
little
wicket-gate
not
larger
than
a
man's
face
had
been
opened
from
within
this
was
terribly
provoking
here
was
an
extent
of
caution
on
the
part
of
the
garrison
quite
unexpected
what
was
to
be
done
well
said
the
man
who
appeared
at
the
little
opening
oh
said
he
who
had
knocked
i--
well
i--that
is
to
say--ahem
is
sir
francis
varney
within
well
i
say
is
sir
francis
varney
within
well
you
have
said
it
ah
but
you
have
not
answered
it
no
well
is
he
at
home
i
decline
saying
so
you
had
better
all
of
you
go
back
to
the
town
again
for
we
are
well
provided
with
all
material
to
resist
any
attack
you
may
be
fools
enough
to
make
as
he
spoke
the
servant
shut
the
little
square
door
with
a
bang
that
made
his
questioner
jump
again
here
was
a
dilemma
the
attack
upon
the
vampyre's
house--the
story
of
the
attack--the
forcing
of
the
doors
and
the
struggle
illustration
a
council
of
war
was
now
called
among
the
belligerents
who
were
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
steady
refusal
of
the
servant
to
admit
them
and
their
apparent
determination
to
resist
all
endeavours
on
the
part
of
the
mob
to
get
into
and
obtain
possession
of
the
house
it
argued
that
they
were
prepared
to
resist
all
attempts
and
it
would
cost
some
few
lives
to
get
into
the
vampyre's
house
this
passed
through
the
minds
of
many
as
they
retired
behind
the
angle
of
the
wall
where
the
council
was
to
be
held
here
they
looked
in
each
others'
face
as
if
to
gather
from
that
the
general
tone
of
the
feelings
of
their
companions
but
here
they
saw
nothing
that
intimated
the
least
idea
of
going
back
as
they
came
it's
all
very
well
mates
to
take
care
of
ourselves
you
know
began
one
tall
brawny
fellow
but
if
we
bean't
to
be
sucked
to
death
by
a
vampyre
why
we
must
have
the
life
out
of
him
ay
so
we
must
jack
hodge
is
right
we
must
kill
him
and
there's
no
sin
in
it
for
he
has
no
right
to
it
he's
robbed
some
poor
fellow
of
his
life
to
prolong
his
own
ay
ay
that's
the
way
he
does
bring
him
out
i
say
then
see
what
we
will
do
with
him
yes
catch
him
first
said
one
and
then
we
can
dispose
of
him
afterwards
i
say
neighbours
don't
you
think
it
would
be
as
well
to
catch
him
first
haven't
we
come
on
purpose
yes
but
do
it
ain't
we
trying
it
you
will
presently
when
we
come
to
get
into
the
house
well
what's
to
be
done
said
one
here
we
are
in
a
fix
i
think
and
i
can't
see
our
way
out
very
clearly
illustration
i
wish
we
could
get
in
but
how
is
a
question
i
don't
very
well
see
said
a
large
specimen
of
humanity
the
best
thing
that
can
be
done
will
be
to
go
round
and
look
over
the
whole
house
and
then
we
may
come
upon
some
part
where
it
is
far
easier
to
get
in
at
than
by
the
front
door
but
it
won't
do
for
us
all
to
go
round
that
way
said
one
a
small
party
only
should
go
else
they
will
have
all
their
people
stationed
at
one
point
and
if
we
can
divide
them
we
shall
beat
them
because
they
have
not
enough
to
defend
more
than
one
point
at
a
time
now
we
are
numerous
enough
to
make
several
attacks
oh
that's
the
way
to
bother
them
all
round
they'll
give
in
and
then
the
place
is
our
own
no
no
said
the
big
countryman
i
like
to
make
a
good
rush
and
drive
all
afore
us
you
know
what
ye
have
to
do
then
and
you
do
it
ye
know
if
you
can
ay
to
be
sure
if
we
can
as
you
say
but
can't
we
that's
what
i
want
to
know
to
be
sure
we
can
then
we'll
do
it
mate--that's
my
mind
we'll
do
it
come
on
and
let's
have
another
look
at
the
street-door
the
big
countryman
left
the
main
body
and
resolutely
walked
up
to
the
main
avenue
and
approached
the
door
accompanied
by
about
a
dozen
or
less
of
the
mob
when
they
came
to
the
door
they
commenced
knocking
and
kicking
most
violently
and
assailing
it
with
all
kinds
of
things
they
could
lay
their
hands
upon
they
continued
at
this
violent
exercise
for
some
time--perhaps
for
five
minutes
when
the
little
square
hole
in
the
door
was
again
opened
and
a
voice
was
heard
to
say--
you
had
better
cease
that
kind
of
annoyance
we
want
to
get
in
it
will
cost
you
more
lives
to
do
so
than
you
can
afford
to
spare
we
are
well
armed
and
are
prepared
to
resist
any
effort
you
can
make
oh
it's
all
very
well
but
an
you
won't
open
why
we'll
make
you
that's
all
about
it
this
was
said
as
the
big
countryman
and
his
companions
were
leaving
the
avenue
towards
the
rest
of
the
body
then
take
this
as
an
earnest
of
what
is
to
follow
said
the
man
and
he
discharged
the
contents
of
a
blunderbuss
through
the
small
opening
and
its
report
sounded
to
the
rest
of
the
mob
like
the
report
of
a
field-piece
fortunately
for
the
party
retiring
the
man
couldn't
take
any
aim
else
it
is
questionable
how
many
of
the
party
would
have
got
off
unwounded
as
it
was
several
of
them
found
stray
slugs
were
lodged
in
various
parts
of
their
persons
and
accelerated
their
retreat
from
the
house
of
the
vampyre
what
luck
inquired
one
of
the
mob
to
the
others
as
they
came
back
i'm
afraid
you
had
all
the
honour
ay
ay
we
have
and
all
the
lead
too
replied
a
man
as
he
placed
his
hand
upon
a
sore
part
of
his
person
which
bled
in
consequence
of
a
wound
well
what's
to
be
done
danged
if
i
know
said
one
give
it
up
said
another
no
no
have
him
out
i'll
never
give
in
while
i
can
use
a
stick
they
are
in
earnest
and
so
are
we
don't
let
us
be
frightened
because
they
have
a
gun
or
two--they
can't
have
many
and
besides
if
they
have
we
are
too
many
for
them
besides
we
shall
all
die
in
our
beds
hurrah
down
with
the
vampyre
so
say
i
lads
i
don't
want
to
be
sucked
to
death
when
i'm
a-bed
better
die
like
a
man
than
such
a
dog's
death
as
that
and
you
have
no
revenge
then
no
no
he
has
the
better
of
us
then
we'll
have
him
out--we'll
burn
him--that's
the
way
we'll
do
it
ay
so
we
will
only
let
us
get
in
at
that
moment
a
chosen
party
returned
who
had
been
round
the
house
to
make
a
reconnaissance
well
well
inquired
the
mob
what
can
be
done
now--where
can
we
get
in
in
several
places
all
right
come
along
then
the
place
is
our
own
stop
a
minute
they
are
armed
at
all
points
and
we
must
make
an
attack
on
all
points
else
we
may
fail
a
party
must
go
round
to
the
front-door
and
attempt
to
beat
it
in
there
are
plenty
of
poles
and
things
that
could
be
used
for
such
a
purpose
there
is
besides
a
garden-door
that
opens
into
the
house--a
kind
of
parlour
a
kitchen-door
a
window
in
the
flower-garden
and
an
entrance
into
a
store-room
this
place
appears
strong
and
is
therefore
unguarded
the
very
point
to
make
an
attack
not
quite
why
not
because
it
can
easily
be
defended
and
rendered
useless
to
us
we
must
make
an
attack
upon
all
places
but
that
and
while
they
are
being
at
those
points
we
can
then
enter
at
that
place
and
then
you
will
find
them
desert
the
other
places
when
they
see
us
inside
hurrah
down
with
the
vampyre
said
the
mob
as
they
listened
to
this
advice
and
appreciated
the
plan
down
with
the
vampyre
now
then
lads
divide
and
make
the
attack
never
mind
their
guns
they
have
but
very
few
and
if
you
rush
in
upon
them
you
will
soon
have
the
guns
yourselves
hurrah
hurrah
shouted
the
mob
the
mob
now
moved
away
in
different
bodies
each
strong
enough
to
carry
the
house
they
seized
upon
a
variety
of
poles
and
stones
and
then
made
for
the
various
doors
and
windows
that
were
pointed
out
by
those
who
had
made
the
discovery
each
one
of
those
who
had
formed
the
party
of
observation
formed
a
leader
to
the
others
and
at
once
proceeded
to
the
post
assigned
him
the
attack
was
so
sudden
and
so
simultaneous
that
the
servants
were
unprepared
and
though
they
ran
to
the
doors
and
fired
away
still
they
did
but
little
good
for
the
doors
were
soon
forced
open
by
the
enraged
rioters
who
proceeded
in
a
much
more
systematic
operation
using
long
heavy
pieces
of
timber
which
were
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
several
men
and
driven
with
the
force
of
battering-rams--which
in
fact
they
were--against
the
door
bang
went
the
battering-ram
crash
went
the
door
and
the
whole
party
rushed
headlong
in
carried
forward
by
their
own
momentum
and
fell
prostrate
engine
and
all
into
the
passage
now
then
we
have
them
exclaimed
the
servants
who
began
to
belabour
the
whole
party
with
blows
with
every
weapon
they
could
secure
loudly
did
the
fallen
men
shout
for
assistance
and
but
for
their
fellows
who
came
rushing
in
behind
they
would
have
had
but
a
sorry
time
of
it
hurrah
shouted
the
mob
the
house
is
our
own
not
yet
shouted
the
servants
we'll
try
said
the
mob
and
they
rushed
forward
to
drive
the
servants
back
but
they
met
with
a
stout
resistance
and
as
some
of
them
had
choppers
and
swords
there
were
a
few
wounds
given
and
presently
bang
went
the
blunderbuss
two
or
three
of
the
mob
reeled
and
fell
this
produced
a
momentary
panic
and
the
servants
then
had
the
whole
of
the
victory
to
themselves
and
were
about
to
charge
and
clear
the
passage
of
their
enemies
when
a
shout
behind
attracted
their
attention
that
shout
was
caused
by
an
entrance
being
gained
in
another
quarter
whence
the
servants
were
flying
and
all
was
disorder
hurrah
hurrah
shouted
the
mob
the
servants
retreated
to
the
stairs
and
here
united
they
made
a
stand
and
resolved
to
resist
the
whole
force
of
the
rioters
and
they
succeeded
in
doing
so
too
for
some
minutes
blows
were
given
and
taken
of
a
desperate
character
somehow
there
were
no
deadly
blows
received
by
the
servants
they
were
being
forced
and
beaten
but
they
lost
no
life
this
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
mob
used
no
more
deadly
weapons
than
sticks
the
servants
of
sir
francis
varney
on
the
contrary
were
mostly
armed
with
deadly
weapons
which
however
they
did
not
use
unnecessarily
they
stood
upon
the
hall
steps--the
grand
staircase
with
long
poles
or
sticks
about
the
size
of
quarter-staves
and
with
these
they
belaboured
those
below
most
unmercifully
certainly
the
mob
were
by
no
means
cowards
for
the
struggle
to
close
with
their
enemies
was
as
great
as
ever
and
as
firm
as
could
well
be
indeed
they
rushed
on
with
a
desperation
truly
characteristic
of
john
bull
and
defied
the
heaviest
blows
for
as
fast
as
one
was
stricken
down
another
occupied
his
place
and
they
insensibly
pressed
their
close
and
compact
front
upon
the
servants
who
were
becoming
fatigued
and
harassed
fire
again
exclaimed
a
voice
from
among
the
servants
the
mob
made
no
retrogade
movement
but
still
continued
to
press
onwards
and
in
another
moment
a
loud
report
rang
through
the
house
and
a
smoke
hung
over
the
heads
of
the
mob
a
long
groan
or
two
escaped
some
of
the
men
who
had
been
wounded
and
a
still
louder
from
those
who
had
not
been
wounded
and
a
cry
arose
of--
down
with
the
vampyre--pull
down--destroy
and
burn
the
whole
place--down
with
them
all
a
rush
succeeded
and
a
few
more
discharges
took
place
when
a
shout
above
attracted
the
attention
of
both
parties
engaged
in
this
fierce
struggle
they
paused
by
mutual
consent
to
look
and
see
what
was
the
cause
of
that
shout
the
interview
between
the
mob
and
sir
francis
varney--the
mysterious
disappearance--the
wine
cellars
illustration
the
shout
that
had
so
discomposed
the
parties
who
were
thus
engaged
in
a
terrific
struggle
came
from
a
party
above
hurrah
hurrah
they
shouted
a
number
of
times
in
a
wild
strain
of
delight
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
the
fact
was
a
party
of
the
mob
had
clambered
up
a
verandah
and
entered
some
of
the
rooms
upstairs
whence
they
emerged
just
above
the
landing
near
the
spot
where
the
servants
were
resisting
in
a
mass
the
efforts
of
the
mob
hurrah
shouted
the
mob
below
hurrah
shouted
the
mob
above
there
was
a
momentary
pause
and
the
servants
divided
themselves
into
two
bodies
and
one
turned
to
face
those
above
and
the
other
those
who
were
below
a
simultaneous
shout
was
given
by
both
parties
of
the
mob
and
a
sudden
rush
was
made
by
both
bodies
and
the
servants
of
sir
francis
varney
were
broken
in
an
instant
they
were
instantly
separated
and
knocked
about
a
good
bit
but
they
were
left
to
shift
for
themselves
the
mob
had
a
more
important
object
in
view
down
with
the
vampyre
they
shouted
down
with
the
vampyre
shouted
they
and
they
rushed
helter
skelter
through
the
rooms
until
they
came
to
one
where
the
door
was
partially
open
and
they
could
see
some
person
very
leisurely
seated
here
he
is
they
cried
who
who
the
vampire
down
with
him
kill
him
burn
him
hurrah
down
with
the
vampire
these
sounds
were
shouted
out
by
a
score
of
voices
and
they
rushed
headlong
into
the
room
but
here
their
violence
and
headlong
precipitancy
were
suddenly
restrained
by
the
imposing
and
quiet
appearance
of
the
individual
who
was
there
seated
the
mob
entered
the
room
and
there
was
a
sight
that
if
it
did
not
astonish
them
at
least
it
caused
them
to
pause
before
the
individual
who
was
seated
there
the
room
was
well
filled
with
furniture
and
there
was
a
curtain
drawn
across
the
room
and
about
the
middle
of
it
there
was
a
table
behind
which
sat
sir
francis
varney
himself
looking
all
smiles
and
courtesy
well
dang
my
smock-frock
said
one
who'd
ha'
thought
of
this
he
don't
seem
to
care
much
about
it
well
i'm
d----d
said
another
he
seems
pretty
easy
at
all
events
what
is
he
going
to
do
gentlemen
said
sir
francis
varney
rising
with
the
blandest
smiles
pray
gentlemen
permit
me
to
inquire
the
cause
of
this
condescension
on
your
part
the
visit
is
kind
the
mob
looked
at
sir
francis
and
then
at
each
other
and
then
at
sir
francis
again
but
nobody
spoke
they
were
awed
by
this
gentlemanly
and
collected
behaviour
if
you
honour
me
with
this
visit
from
pure
affection
and
neighbourly
good-will
i
thank
you
down
with
the
vampyre
said
one
who
was
concealed
behind
the
rest
and
not
so
much
overawed
as
he
had
not
seen
sir
francis
sir
francis
varney
rose
to
his
full
height
a
light
gleamed
across
his
features
they
were
strongly
defined
then
his
long
front
teeth
too
showed
most
strongly
when
he
smiled
as
he
did
now
and
said
in
a
bland
voice--
gentlemen
i
am
at
your
service
permit
me
to
say
you
are
welcome
to
all
i
can
do
for
you
i
fear
the
interview
will
be
somewhat
inconvenient
and
unpleasant
to
you
as
for
myself
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
as
sir
francis
spoke
he
bowed
and
folded
his
hands
together
and
stepped
forwards
but
instead
of
coming
onwards
to
them
he
walked
behind
the
curtain
and
was
immediately
hid
from
their
view
down
with
the
vampyre
shouted
one
down
with
the
vampyre
rang
through
the
apartment
and
the
mob
now
not
awed
by
the
coolness
and
courtesy
of
sir
francis
rushed
forward
and
overturning
the
table
tore
down
the
curtain
to
the
floor
but
to
their
amazement
there
was
no
sir
francis
varney
present
where
is
he
where
is
the
vampyre
where
has
he
gone
these
were
cries
that
escaped
every
one's
lips
and
yet
no
one
could
give
an
answer
to
them
there
sir
francis
varney
was
not
they
were
completely
thunderstricken
they
could
not
find
out
where
he
had
gone
to
there
was
no
possible
means
of
escape
that
they
could
perceive
there
was
not
an
odd
corner
or
even
anything
that
could
by
any
possibility
give
even
a
suspicion
that
even
a
temporary
concealment
could
take
place
they
looked
over
every
inch
of
flooring
and
of
wainscoting
not
the
remotest
trace
could
be
discovered
where
is
he
i
don't
know
said
one--i
can't
see
where
he
could
have
gone
there
ain't
a
hole
as
big
as
a
keyhole
my
eye
said
one
i
shouldn't
be
at
all
surprised
if
he
were
to
blow
up
the
whole
house
you
don't
say
go
i
never
heard
as
how
vampyres
could
do
so
much
as
that
they
ain't
the
sort
of
people
said
another
but
if
they
can
do
one
thing
they
can
do
another
that's
very
true
and
what's
more
i
never
heard
as
how
a
vampyre
could
make
himself
into
nothing
before
yet
he
has
done
so
he
may
be
in
this
room
now
he
may
my
eyes
what
precious
long
teeth
he
had
yes
and
had
he
fixed
one
on
'em
in
to
your
arm
he
would
have
drawn
every
drop
of
blood
out
of
your
body
you
may
depend
upon
that
said
an
old
man
he
was
very
tall
yes
too
tall
to
be
any
good
i
shouldn't
like
him
to
have
laid
hold
of
me
though
tall
as
he
is
and
then
he
would
have
lifted
me
up
high
enough
to
break
my
neck
when
he
let
me
fall
the
mob
routed
about
the
room
tore
everything
out
of
its
place
and
as
the
object
of
their
search
seemed
to
be
far
enough
beyond
their
reach
their
courage
rose
in
proportion
and
they
shouted
and
screamed
with
a
proportionate
increase
of
noise
and
bustle
and
at
length
they
ran
about
mad
with
rage
and
vexation
doing
all
the
mischief
that
was
in
their
power
to
inflict
then
they
became
mischievous
and
tore
the
furniture
from
its
place
and
broke
it
in
pieces
and
then
amused
themselves
with
breaking
it
up
throwing
pieces
at
the
pier-glasses
in
which
they
made
dreadful
holes
and
when
that
was
gone
they
broke
up
the
frames
every
hole
and
corner
of
the
house
was
searched
but
there
was
no
sir
francis
varney
to
be
found
the
cellars
the
cellars
shouted
a
voice
the
cellars
the
cellars
re-echoed
nearly
every
pair
of
lips
in
the
whole
place
in
another
moment
there
was
crushing
and
crowding
to
get
down
into
the
cellars
hurray
said
one
as
he
knocked
off
the
neck
of
the
bottle
that
first
came
to
hand
here's
luck
to
vampyre-hunting
success
to
our
chase
so
say
i
neighbour
but
is
that
your
manners
to
drink
before
your
betters
so
saying
the
speaker
knocked
the
other's
elbow
while
he
was
in
the
act
of
lifting
the
wine
to
his
mouth
and
thus
he
upset
it
over
his
face
and
eyes
d--n
it
cried
the
man
how
it
makes
my
eyes
smart
dang
thee
if
i
could
see
i'd
ring
thy
neck
success
to
vampyre-hunting
said
one
may
we
be
lucky
yet
said
another
i
wouldn't
be
luckier
than
this
said
another
as
he
too
emptied
a
bottle
we
couldn't
desire
better
entertainment
where
the
reckoning
is
all
paid
excellent
very
good
capital
wine
this
i
say
huggins
well
said
huggins
what
are
you
drinking
wine
what
wine
danged
if
i
know
was
the
reply
it's
wine
i
suppose
for
i
know
it
ain't
beer
nor
spirits
so
it
must
be
wine
are
you
sure
it
ain't
bottled
men's
blood
eh
bottled
blood
man
who
knows
what
a
vampyre
drinks
it
may
be
his
wine
he
may
feast
upon
that
before
he
goes
to
bed
of
a
night
drink
anybody's
health
and
make
himself
cheerful
on
bottled
blood
oh
danged
i'm
so
sick
i
wish
i
hadn't
taken
the
stuff
it
may
be
as
you
say
neighbour
and
then
we
be
cannibals
or
vampyres
there's
a
pretty
thing
to
think
of
by
this
time
some
were
drunk
some
were
partially
so
and
the
remainder
were
crowding
into
the
cellars
to
get
their
share
of
the
wine
the
servants
had
now
slunk
away
they
were
no
longer
noticed
by
the
rioters
who
having
nobody
to
oppose
them
no
longer
thought
of
anything
save
the
searching
after
the
vampyre
and
the
destruction
of
the
property
several
hours
had
been
spent
in
this
manner
and
yet
they
could
not
find
the
object
of
their
search
there
was
not
a
room
or
cupboard
or
a
cellar
that
was
capable
of
containing
a
cat
that
they
did
not
search
besides
a
part
of
the
rioters
keeping
a
very
strict
watch
on
the
outside
of
the
house
and
all
about
the
grounds
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
the
escape
of
the
vampyre
there
was
a
general
cessation
of
active
hostilities
at
that
moment
a
reaction
after
the
violent
excitement
and
exertion
they
had
made
to
get
in
then
the
escape
of
their
victim
and
the
mysterious
manner
in
which
he
got
away
was
also
a
cause
of
the
reaction
and
the
rioters
looked
in
each
others'
countenances
inquiringly
above
all
the
discovery
of
the
wine-cellar
tended
to
withdraw
them
from
violent
measures
but
this
could
not
last
long
there
must
be
an
end
to
such
a
scene
for
there
never
was
a
large
body
of
men
assembled
for
an
evil
purpose
who
ever
were
for
any
length
of
time
peaceable
to
prevent
the
more
alarming
effects
of
drunkenness
some
few
of
the
rioters
after
having
taken
some
small
portion
of
the
wine
became
from
the
peculiar
flavour
it
possessed
imbued
with
the
idea
that
it
was
really
blood
and
forthwith
commenced
an
instant
attack
upon
the
wine
and
liquors
and
they
were
soon
mingling
in
one
stream
throughout
the
cellars
this
destruction
was
loudly
declaimed
against
by
a
large
portion
of
the
rioters
who
were
drinking
but
before
they
could
make
any
efforts
to
save
the
liquor
the
work
of
destruction
had
not
only
been
begun
but
was
ended
and
the
consequence
was
the
cellars
were
very
soon
evacuated
by
the
mob
the
destruction
of
sir
francis
varney's
house
by
fire--the
arrival
of
the
military
and
a
second
mob
illustration
thus
many
moments
had
not
elapsed
ere
the
feelings
of
the
rioters
became
directed
into
a
different
channel
from
that
in
which
it
had
so
lately
flowed
when
urged
about
the
house
and
grounds
for
the
vampyre
they
became
impatient
and
angry
at
not
finding
him
many
believed
that
he
was
yet
about
the
house
while
many
were
of
opinion
that
he
had
flown
away
by
some
mysterious
means
only
possessed
by
vampyres
and
such
like
people
fire
the
house
and
burn
him
out
said
one
fire
the
house
burn
the
den
now
arose
in
shouts
from
all
present
and
then
the
mob
were
again
animated
by
the
love
of
mischief
that
seemed
to
be
the
strongest
feelings
that
animated
them
burn
him
out--burn
him
out
were
the
only
words
that
could
be
heard
from
any
of
the
mob
the
words
ran
through
the
house
like
wildfire
nobody
thought
of
anything
else
and
all
were
seen
running
about
in
confusion
there
was
no
want
of
good
will
on
the
part
of
the
mob
to
the
undertaking
far
from
it
and
they
proceeded
in
the
work
con
amore
they
worked
together
with
right
good
will
and
the
result
was
soon
seen
by
the
heaps
of
combustible
materials
that
were
collected
in
a
short
time
from
all
parts
of
the
house
all
the
old
dry
wood
furniture
that
could
be
found
was
piled
up
in
a
heap
and
to
these
were
added
a
number
of
faggots
and
also
some
shavings
that
were
found
in
the
cellar
all
right
exclaimed
one
man
in
exultation
yes
replied
a
second
all
right--all
right
set
light
to
it
and
he
will
be
smoked
out
if
not
burned
let
us
be
sure
that
all
are
out
of
the
house
suggested
one
of
the
bystanders
ay
ay
shouted
several
give
them
all
a
chance
search
through
the
house
and
give
them
a
warning
very
well
give
me
the
light
and
then
when
i
come
back
i
will
set
light
to
the
fire
at
once
and
then
i
shall
know
all
is
empty
and
so
will
you
too
this
was
at
once
agreed
to
by
all
with
acclamations
and
the
light
being
handed
to
the
man
he
ascended
the
stairs
crying
out
in
a
loud
voice--
come
out--come
out
the
house
is
on
fire
fire
fire
fire
shouted
the
mob
as
a
chorus
every
now
and
then
at
intervals
in
about
ten
minutes
more
there
came
a
cry
of
all
right
the
house
is
empty
from
up
the
stairs
and
the
man
descended
in
haste
to
the
hall
make
haste
lads
and
fire
away
for
i
see
the
red
coats
are
leaving
the
town
hurra
hurra
shouted
the
infuriated
mob
fire--fire--fire
the
house
burn
out
the
vampyre
burn
down
the
house--burn
him
out
and
see
if
he
can
stand
fire
amidst
all
this
tumult
there
came
a
sudden
blaze
upon
all
around
for
the
pile
had
been
fired
hurra
shouted
the
mob--hurra
and
they
danced
like
maniacs
round
the
fire
looking
in
fact
like
so
many
wild
indians
dancing
round
their
roasting
victims
or
some
demons
at
an
infernal
feast
the
torch
had
been
put
to
twenty
different
places
and
the
flames
united
into
one
and
suddenly
shot
up
with
a
velocity
and
roared
with
a
sound
that
caused
many
who
were
present
to
make
a
precipitate
retreat
from
the
hall
this
soon
became
a
necessary
measure
of
self-preservation
and
it
required
no
urging
to
induce
them
to
quit
a
place
that
was
burning
rapidly
and
even
furiously
get
the
poles
and
firewood--get
faggots
shouted
some
of
the
mob
and
lo
it
was
done
almost
by
magic
they
brought
the
faggots
and
wood
piled
up
for
winter
use
and
laid
them
near
all
the
doors
and
especially
the
main
entrance
nay
every
gate
or
door
belonging
to
the
outhouses
was
brought
forward
and
placed
upon
the
fire
which
now
began
to
reach
the
upper
stories
hurra--fire
hurra--fire
and
a
loud
shout
of
triumph
came
from
the
mob
as
they
viewed
the
progress
of
the
flames
as
they
came
roaring
and
tearing
through
the
house
doors
and
the
windows
each
new
victory
of
the
element
was
a
signal
to
the
mob
for
a
cheer
and
a
hearty
cheer
too
came
from
them
where
is
the
vampyre
now
exclaimed
one
ha
where
is
he
said
another
if
he
be
there
said
the
man
pointing
to
the
flames
i
reckon
he's
got
a
warm
berth
of
it
and
at
the
same
time
very
little
water
to
boil
in
his
kettle
ha
ha
what
a
funny
old
man
is
bob
mason
he's
always
poking
fun
he'd
joke
if
his
wife
were
dying
there
is
many
a
true
word
spoken
in
jest
suggested
another
and
to
my
mind
bob
mason
wouldn't
be
very
much
grieved
if
his
wife
were
to
die
die
said
bob
she
and
i
have
lived
and
quarrelled
daily
a
matter
of
five-and-thirty
years
and
if
that
ain't
enough
to
make
a
man
sick
of
being
married
and
of
his
wife
hand
me
that's
all
i
say
i
am
tired
this
was
said
with
much
apparent
sincerity
and
several
laughed
at
the
old
man's
heartiness
it's
all
very
well
said
the
old
man
it's
all
very
well
to
laugh
about
matters
you
don't
understand
but
i
know
it
isn't
a
joke--not
a
bit
on
it
i
tells
you
what
it
is
neighbour
i
never
made
but
one
grand
mistake
in
all
my
life
and
what
was
that
to
tie
myself
to
a
woman
why
you'd
get
married
to-morrow
if
your
wife
were
to
die
to-day
said
one
if
i
did
i
hope
i
may
marry
a
vampyre
i
should
have
something
then
to
think
about
i
should
know
what's
o'clock
but
as
for
my
old
woman
lord
lord
i
wish
sir
francis
varney
had
had
her
for
life
i'll
warrant
when
the
next
natural
term
of
his
existence
came
round
again
he
wouldn't
be
in
no
hurry
to
renew
it
if
he
did
i
should
say
that
vampyres
had
the
happy
lot
of
managing
women
which
i
haven't
got
no
nor
anybody
else
a
loud
shout
now
attracted
their
attention
and
upon
looking
in
the
quarter
whence
it
came
they
descried
a
large
body
of
people
coming
towards
them
from
one
end
of
the
mob
could
be
seen
a
long
string
of
red
coats
the
red
coats
shouted
one
the
military
shouted
another
it
was
plain
the
military
who
had
been
placed
in
the
town
to
quell
disturbances
had
been
made
acquainted
with
the
proceedings
at
sir
francis
varney's
house
and
were
now
marching
to
relieve
the
place
and
to
save
the
property
they
were
as
we
have
stated
accompanied
by
a
vast
concourse
of
people
who
came
out
to
see
what
they
were
going
to
see
and
seeing
the
flames
at
sir
francis
varney's
house
they
determined
to
come
all
the
way
and
be
present
the
military
seeing
the
disturbance
in
the
distance
and
the
flames
issuing
from
the
windows
made
the
best
of
their
way
towards
the
scene
of
tumult
with
what
speed
they
could
make
here
they
come
said
one
yes
just
in
time
to
see
what
is
done
yes
they
can
go
back
and
say
we
have
burned
the
vampyre's
house
down--hurra
hurra
shouted
the
mob
in
prolonged
accents
and
it
reached
the
ears
of
the
military
the
officer
urged
the
men
onwards
and
they
responded
to
his
words
by
exerting
themselves
to
step
out
a
little
faster
oh
they
should
have
been
here
before
this
it's
no
use
now
they
are
too
late
yes
they
are
too
late
i
wonder
if
the
vampyre
can
breathe
through
the
smoke
and
live
in
fire
said
one
i
should
think
he
must
be
able
to
do
so
if
he
can
stand
shooting
as
we
know
he
can--you
can't
kill
a
vampyre
but
yet
he
must
be
consumed
if
the
fire
actually
touches
him
but
not
unless
he
can
bear
almost
anything
so
he
can
hurra
shouted
the
mob
as
a
tall
flame
shot
through
the
top
windows
of
the
house
the
fire
had
got
the
ascendant
now
and
no
hopes
could
be
entertained
however
extravagant
of
saving
the
smallest
article
that
had
been
left
in
the
mansion
hurra
shouted
the
mob
with
the
military
who
came
up
with
them
hurra
shouted
the
others
in
reply
quick
march
said
the
officer
and
then
in
a
loud
commanding
tone
he
shouted
clear
the
way
there
clear
the
way
ay
there's
room
enough
for
you
said
old
mason
what
are
you
making
so
much
noise
about
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
the
officer
who
took
no
notice
of
the
words
but
ordered
his
men
up
before
the
burning
pile
which
was
now
an
immense
mass
of
flame
the
mob
who
had
accompanied
the
military
now
mingled
with
the
mob
that
had
set
the
house
of
sir
francis
varney
on
fire
ere
the
military
had
come
up
with
them
halt
cried
out
the
officer
and
the
men
obedient
to
the
word
of
command
halted
and
drew
up
in
a
double
line
before
the
house
there
were
then
some
words
of
command
issued
and
some
more
given
to
some
of
the
subalterns
and
a
party
of
men
under
the
command
of
a
sergeant
was
sent
off
from
the
main
body
to
make
a
circuit
of
the
house
and
grounds
the
officer
gazed
for
some
moments
upon
the
burning
pile
without
speaking
and
then
turning
to
the
next
in
command
he
said
in
low
tones
as
he
looked
upon
the
mob--
we
have
come
too
late
yes
much
the
house
is
now
nearly
gutted
it
is
and
those
who
came
crowding
along
with
us
are
inextricably
mingled
with
the
others
who
have
been
the
cause
of
all
this
mischief
there's
no
distinguishing
them
one
from
another
and
if
you
did
you
could
not
say
who
had
done
it
and
who
had
not
you
could
prove
nothing
exactly
i
shall
not
attempt
to
take
prisoners
unless
any
act
is
perpetrated
beyond
what
has
been
done
it
is
a
singular
affair
very
this
sir
francis
varney
is
represented
to
be
a
courteous
gentlemanly
man
said
the
officer
no
doubt
about
it
but
he's
beset
by
a
parcel
of
people
who
do
not
mind
cutting
a
throat
if
they
can
get
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
and
i
expect
they
will
yes
when
there
is
a
popular
excitement
against
any
man
he
had
better
leave
this
part
at
once
and
altogether
it
is
dangerous
to
tamper
with
popular
prejudices
no
man
who
has
any
value
for
his
life
ought
to
do
so
it
is
a
sheer
act
of
suicide
the
burning
of
varney's
house--a
night
scene--popular
superstition
illustration
the
officer
ceased
to
speak
and
then
the
party
whom
he
had
sent
round
the
house
and
grounds
returned
and
gained
the
main
body
orderly
enough
and
the
sergeant
went
forward
to
make
his
report
to
his
superior
officer
after
the
usual
salutation
he
waited
for
the
inquiry
to
be
put
to
him
as
to
what
he
had
seen
well
scott
what
have
you
done
i
went
round
the
premises
sir
according
to
your
instructions
but
saw
no
one
either
in
the
vicinity
of
the
house
or
in
the
grounds
around
it
no
strangers
eh
no
sir
none
you
saw
nothing
at
all
likely
to
lead
to
any
knowledge
as
to
who
it
was
that
has
caused
this
catastrophe
no
sir
have
you
learnt
anything
among
the
people
who
are
the
perpetrators
of
this
fire
no
sir
well
then
that
will
do
unless
there
is
anything
else
that
you
can
think
of
nothing
further
sir
unless
it
is
that
i
heard
some
of
them
say
that
sir
francis
varney
has
perished
in
the
flames
good
heavens
so
i
heard
sir
that
must
be
impossible
and
yet
why
should
it
be
so
go
back
scott
and
bring
me
some
person
who
can
give
me
some
information
upon
this
point
the
sergeant
departed
toward
the
people
who
looked
at
him
without
any
distrust
for
he
came
single-handed
though
they
thought
he
came
with
the
intention
of
learning
what
they
knew
of
each
other
and
so
stroll
about
with
the
intention
of
getting
up
accusations
against
them
but
this
was
not
the
case
the
officer
didn't
like
the
work
well
enough
he'd
rather
have
been
elsewhere
illustration
at
length
the
sergeant
came
to
one
man
whom
he
accosted
and
said
to
him--
do
you
know
anything
of
yonder
fire
yes
i
do
know
it
is
a
fire
yes
and
so
do
i
my
friend
said
the
sergeant
when
a
soldier
asks
a
question
he
does
not
expect
an
uncivil
answer
but
a
soldier
may
ask
a
question
that
may
have
an
uncivil
end
to
it
he
may
but
it
is
easy
to
say
so
i
do
say
so
then
now
then
i'll
not
trouble
you
any
more
the
sergeant
moved
on
a
pace
or
two
more
and
then
turning
to
the
mob
he
said--
is
there
any
one
among
you
who
can
tell
me
anything
concerning
the
fate
of
sir
francis
varney
burnt
did
you
see
him
burnt
no
but
i
saw
him
in
the
flames
no
before
the
house
was
on
fire
in
the
house
yes
and
he
has
not
been
seen
to
leave
it
since
and
we
conclude
he
must
have
been
burned
will
you
come
and
say
as
much
to
my
commanding
officer
it
is
all
i
want
shall
i
be
detained
no
then
i
will
go
said
the
man
and
he
hobbled
out
of
the
crowd
towards
the
sergeant
i
will
go
and
see
the
officer
and
tell
him
what
i
know
and
that
is
very
little
and
can
prejudice
no
one
hurrah
said
the
crowd
when
they
heard
this
latter
assertion
for
at
first
they
began
to
be
in
some
alarm
lest
there
should
be
something
wrong
about
this
and
some
of
them
get
identified
as
being
active
in
the
fray
the
sergeant
led
the
man
back
to
the
spot
where
the
officer
stood
a
little
way
in
advance
of
his
men
well
scott
he
said
what
have
we
here
a
man
who
has
volunteered
a
statement
sir
oh
well
my
man
can
you
say
anything
concerning
all
this
disturbance
that
we
have
here
no
sir
then
what
did
you
come
here
for
i
understood
the
sergeant
to
want
some
one
who
could
speak
of
sir
francis
varney
well
i
saw
him
where
in
the
house
exactly
but
have
you
not
seen
him
out
of
it
not
since
nor
any
one
else
i
believe
where
was
he
upstairs
where
he
suddenly
disappeared
and
nobody
can
tell
where
he
may
have
gone
to
but
he
has
not
been
seen
out
of
the
house
since
and
they
say
he
could
not
have
gone
bodily
out
if
they
had
not
seen
him
he
must
have
been
burnt
said
the
officer
musingly
he
could
not
escape
one
would
imagine
without
being
seen
by
some
one
out
of
such
a
mob
oh
dear
no
for
i
am
told
they
placed
a
watch
at
every
hole
window
or
door
however
high
and
they
saw
nothing
of
him--not
even
fly
out
fly
out
i'm
speaking
of
a
man
and
i
of
a
vampire
said
the
man
carelessly
a
vampyre
pooh
pooh
oh
no
sir
francis
varney
is
a
vampyre
there
can
be
no
sort
of
doubt
about
it
you
have
only
to
look
at
him
and
you
will
soon
be
satisfied
of
that
see
his
great
sharp
teeth
in
front
and
ask
yourself
what
they
are
for
and
you
will
soon
find
the
answer
they
are
to
make
holes
with
in
the
bodies
of
his
victims
through
which
he
can
suck
their
blood
the
officer
looked
at
the
man
in
astonishment
for
a
few
moments
as
if
he
doubted
his
own
ears
and
then
he
said--
are
you
serious
i
am
ready
to
swear
to
it
well
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
popular
superstition
and
thought
i
had
seen
something
of
it
but
this
is
decidedly
the
worst
case
that
ever
i
saw
or
heard
of
you
had
better
go
home
my
man
than
by
your
presence
countenance
such
a
gross
absurdity
for
all
that
said
the
man
sir
francis
varney
is
a
vampyre--a
blood-sucker--a
human
blood-sucker
get
away
with
you
said
the
officer
and
do
not
repeat
such
folly
before
any
one
the
man
almost
jumped
when
he
heard
the
tone
in
which
this
was
spoken
for
the
officer
was
both
angry
and
contemptuous
when
he
heard
the
words
of
the
man
these
people
he
added
turning
to
the
sergeant
are
ignorant
in
the
extreme
one
would
think
we
had
got
into
the
country
of
vampires
instead
of
a
civilised
community
the
day
was
going
down
now
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
glimmered
upwards
and
still
shone
upon
the
tree-tops
the
darkness
of
night
was
still
fast
closing
around
them
the
mob
stood
a
motley
mass
of
human
beings
wedged
together
dark
and
sombre
gazing
upon
the
mischief
that
had
been
done--the
work
of
their
hands
the
military
stood
at
ease
before
the
burning
pile
and
by
their
order
and
regularity
presented
a
contrast
to
the
mob
as
strongly
by
their
bright
gleaming
arms
as
by
their
dress
and
order
the
flames
now
enveloped
the
whole
mansion
there
was
not
a
window
or
a
door
from
which
the
fiery
element
did
not
burst
forth
in
clouds
and
forked
flames
came
rushing
forth
with
a
velocity
truly
wonderful
the
red
glare
of
the
flames
fell
upon
all
objects
around
for
some
distance--the
more
especially
so
as
the
sun
had
sunk
and
a
bank
of
clouds
rose
from
beneath
the
horizon
and
excluded
all
his
rays
there
was
no
twilight
and
there
was
as
yet
no
moon
the
country
side
was
enveloped
in
darkness
and
the
burning
house
could
be
seen
for
miles
around
and
formed
a
rallying-point
to
all
men's
eyes
the
engines
that
were
within
reach
came
tearing
across
the
country
and
came
to
the
fire
but
they
were
of
no
avail
there
was
no
supply
of
water
save
from
the
ornamental
ponds
these
they
could
only
get
at
by
means
that
were
tedious
and
unsatisfactory
considering
the
emergency
of
the
case
the
house
was
a
lone
one
and
it
was
being
entirely
consumed
before
they
arrived
and
therefore
there
was
not
the
remotest
chance
of
saving
the
least
article
had
they
ever
such
a
supply
of
water
nothing
could
have
been
effected
by
it
thus
the
men
stood
idly
by
passing
their
remarks
upon
the
fire
and
the
mob
those
who
stood
around
and
within
the
influence
of
the
red
glare
of
the
flames
looked
like
so
many
demons
in
the
infernal
regions
watching
the
progress
of
lighting
the
fire
which
we
are
told
by
good
christians
is
the
doom
of
the
unfortunate
in
spirit
and
the
woefully
unlucky
in
circumstances
it
was
a
strange
sight
that
and
there
were
many
persons
who
would
without
doubt
have
rather
been
snug
by
their
own
fire-side
than
they
would
have
remained
there
but
it
happened
that
no
one
felt
inclined
to
express
his
inclination
to
his
neighbour
and
consequently
no
one
said
anything
on
the
subject
none
would
venture
to
go
alone
across
the
fields
where
the
spirit
of
the
vampyre
might
for
all
they
knew
to
the
contrary
be
waiting
to
pounce
upon
them
and
worry
them
no
no
no
man
would
have
quitted
that
mob
to
go
back
alone
to
the
village
they
would
sooner
have
stood
there
all
night
through
that
was
an
alternative
that
none
of
the
number
would
very
willingly
accept
the
hours
passed
away
and
the
house
that
had
been
that
morning
a
noble
and
well-furnished
mansion
was
now
a
smouldering
heap
of
ruins
the
flames
had
become
somewhat
subdued
and
there
was
now
more
smoke
than
flames
the
fire
had
exhausted
itself
there
was
now
no
more
material
that
could
serve
it
for
fuel
and
the
flames
began
to
become
gradually
enough
subdued
suddenly
there
was
a
rush
and
then
a
bright
flame
shot
upward
for
an
instant
so
bright
and
so
strong
that
it
threw
a
flash
of
light
over
the
country
for
miles
but
it
was
only
momentary
and
it
subsided
the
roof
which
had
been
built
strong
enough
to
resist
almost
anything
after
being
burning
for
a
considerable
time
suddenly
gave
way
and
came
in
with
a
tremendous
crash
and
then
all
was
for
a
moment
darkness
after
this
the
fire
might
be
said
to
be
subdued
it
having
burned
itself
out
and
the
flames
that
could
now
be
seen
were
but
the
result
of
so
much
charred
wood
that
would
probably
smoulder
away
for
a
day
or
two
if
left
to
itself
to
do
so
a
dense
mass
of
smoke
arose
from
the
ruins
and
blackened
the
atmosphere
around
and
told
the
spectators
the
work
was
done
the
return
of
the
mob
and
military
to
the
town--the
madness
of
the
mob--the
grocer's
revenge
illustration
on
the
termination
of
the
conflagration
or
rather
the
fall
of
the
roof
with
the
loss
of
grandeur
in
the
spectacle
men's
minds
began
to
be
free
from
the
excitement
that
chained
them
to
the
spot
watching
the
progress
of
that
element
which
has
been
truly
described
as
a
very
good
servant
but
a
very
bad
master
and
of
the
truth
of
this
every
one
must
be
well
satisfied
there
was
now
remaining
little
more
than
the
livid
glare
of
the
hot
and
burning
embers
and
this
did
not
extend
far
for
the
walls
were
too
strongly
built
to
fall
in
from
their
own
weight
they
were
strong
and
stout
and
intercepted
the
little
light
the
ashes
would
have
given
out
the
mob
now
began
to
feel
fatigued
and
chilly
it
had
been
standing
and
walking
about
many
hours
and
the
approach
of
exhaustion
could
not
be
put
off
much
longer
especially
as
there
was
no
longer
any
great
excitement
to
carry
it
off
the
officer
seeing
that
nothing
was
to
be
done
collected
his
men
together
and
they
were
soon
seen
in
motion
he
had
been
ordered
to
stop
any
tumult
that
he
might
have
seen
and
to
save
any
property
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
now
all
the
property
that
could
have
been
saved
was
now
destroyed
and
the
mob
were
beginning
to
disperse
and
creep
towards
their
own
houses
the
order
was
then
given
for
the
men
to
take
close
order
and
keep
together
and
the
word
to
march
was
given
which
the
men
obeyed
with
alacrity
for
they
had
no
good-will
in
stopping
there
the
whole
of
the
night
the
return
to
the
village
of
both
the
mob
and
the
military
was
not
without
its
vicissitudes
accidents
of
all
kinds
were
rife
amongst
them
the
military
however
taking
the
open
paths
soon
diminished
the
distance
and
that
too
with
little
or
no
accidents
save
such
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
state
of
the
fields
after
they
had
been
so
much
trodden
down
of
late
not
so
the
townspeople
or
the
peasantry
for
by
way
of
keeping
up
their
spirits
and
amusing
themselves
on
their
way
home
they
commenced
larking
as
they
called
it
which
often
meant
the
execution
of
practical
jokes
and
these
sometimes
were
of
a
serious
nature
the
night
was
dark
at
that
hour
especially
so
when
there
was
a
number
of
persons
traversing
about
so
that
little
or
nothing
could
be
seen
the
mistakes
and
blunders
that
were
made
were
numerous
in
one
place
there
were
a
number
of
people
penetrating
a
path
that
led
only
to
a
hedge
and
deep
ditch
indeed
it
was
a
brook
very
deep
and
muddy
here
they
came
to
a
stop
and
endeavoured
to
ascertain
its
width
but
the
little
reflected
light
they
had
was
deceptive
and
it
did
not
appear
so
broad
as
it
was
oh
i
can
jump
it
exclaimed
one
and
so
can
i
said
another
i
have
done
so
before
and
why
should
i
not
do
so
now
this
was
unanswerable
and
as
there
were
many
present
at
least
a
dozen
were
eager
to
jump
if
thee
can
do
it
i
know
i
can
said
a
brawny
countryman
so
i'll
do
it
at
once
the
sooner
the
better
shouted
some
one
behind
or
you'll
have
no
room
for
a
run
here's
a
lot
of
'em
coming
up
push
over
as
quickly
as
you
can
thus
urged
the
jumpers
at
once
made
a
rush
to
the
edge
of
the
ditch
and
many
jumped
and
many
more
from
the
prevailing
darkness
did
not
see
exactly
where
the
ditch
was
and
taking
one
or
two
steps
too
many
found
themselves
up
above
the
waist
in
muddy
water
nor
were
those
who
jumped
much
better
off
for
nearly
all
jumped
short
or
fell
backwards
into
the
stream
and
were
dragged
out
in
a
terrible
state
oh
lord
oh
lord
exclaimed
one
poor
fellow
dripping
wet
and
shivering
with
cold
i
shall
die
oh
the
rheumatiz
there'll
be
a
pretty
winter
for
me
i'm
half
dead
hold
your
noise
said
another
and
help
me
to
get
the
mud
out
of
my
eye
i
can't
see
never
mind
added
a
third
considering
how
you
jump
i
don't
think
you
want
to
see
this
comes
a
hunting
vampyres
oh
it's
all
a
judgment
who
knows
but
he
may
be
in
the
air
it
is
nothing
to
laugh
at
as
i
shouldn't
be
surprised
if
he
were
only
think
how
precious
pleasant
however
pleasant
it
may
be
to
you
remarked
one
it's
profitable
to
a
good
many
how
so
why
see
the
numbers
of
things
that
will
be
spoiled
coats
torn
hats
crushed
heads
broken
and
shoes
burst
oh
it's
an
ill-wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
so
it
is
but
you
may
benefit
anybody
you
like
so
you
don't
do
it
at
my
expence
in
one
part
of
a
field
where
there
were
some
stiles
and
gates
a
big
countryman
caught
a
fat
shopkeeper
with
the
arms
of
the
stile
a
terrible
poke
in
the
stomach
while
the
breath
was
knocked
out
of
the
poor
man's
stomach
and
he
was
gasping
with
agony
the
fellow
set
to
laughing
and
said
to
his
companions
who
were
of
the
same
class--
i
say
jim
look
at
the
grocer
he
hasn't
got
any
wind
to
spare
i'd
run
him
for
a
wager
see
how
he
gapes
like
a
fish
out
of
water
the
poor
shopkeeper
felt
indeed
like
a
fish
out
of
water
and
as
he
afterwards
declared
he
felt
just
as
if
he
had
had
a
red
hot
clock
weight
thrust
into
the
midst
of
his
stomach
and
there
left
to
cool
however
the
grocer
would
be
revenged
upon
his
tormentor
who
had
now
lost
sight
of
him
but
the
fat
man
after
a
time
recovering
his
wind
and
the
pain
in
his
stomach
becoming
less
intense
he
gathered
himself
up
my
name
ain't
jones
he
muttered
if
i
don't
be
one
to
his
one
for
that
i'll
do
something
that
shall
make
him
remember
what
it
is
to
insult
a
respectable
tradesman
i'll
never
forgive
such
an
insult
it
is
dark
and
that's
why
it
is
he
has
dared
to
do
this
filled
with
dire
thoughts
and
a
spirit
of
revenge
he
looked
from
side
to
side
to
see
with
what
he
could
effect
his
object
but
could
espy
nothing
it's
shameful
he
muttered
what
would
i
give
for
a
little
retort
i'd
plaster
his
ugly
countenance
as
he
spoke
he
placed
his
hands
on
some
pales
to
rest
himself
when
he
found
that
they
stuck
to
them
the
pales
had
that
day
been
newly
pitched
a
bright
idea
now
struck
him
if
i
could
only
get
a
handful
of
this
stuff
he
thought
i
should
be
able
to
serve
him
out
for
serving
me
out
i
will
cost
what
it
may
i'm
resolved
upon
that
i'll
not
have
my
wind
knocked
out
and
my
inside
set
on
fire
for
nothing
no
no
i'll
be
revenged
on
him
with
this
view
he
felt
over
the
pales
and
found
that
he
could
scrape
off
a
little
only
but
not
with
his
hands
indeed
it
only
plastered
them
he
therefore
marched
about
for
something
to
scrape
it
off
with
ah
i
have
a
knife
a
large
pocket
knife
that
will
do
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
i
want
he
immediately
commenced
feeling
for
it
but
had
scarcely
got
his
hand
into
his
pocket
when
he
found
there
would
be
a
great
difficulty
in
either
pushing
it
in
further
or
withdrawing
it
altogether
for
the
pitch
made
it
difficult
to
do
either
and
his
pocket
stuck
to
his
hands
like
a
glove
d--n
it
said
the
grocer
who
would
have
thought
of
that
here's
a
pretty
go
curse
that
fellow
he
is
the
cause
of
all
this
i'll
be
revenged
upon
him
if
it's
a
year
hence
the
enraged
grocer
drew
his
hand
out
but
was
unable
to
effect
his
object
in
withdrawing
the
knife
also
but
he
saw
something
shining
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
exclaiming
as
he
did
so
in
a
gratified
tone
of
voice
ah
here's
something
that
will
do
better
as
he
made
a
grasp
at
it
he
found
he
had
inserted
his
hand
into
something
soft
god
bless
me
what
now
he
pulled
his
hand
hastily
away
and
found
that
it
stuck
slightly
and
then
he
saw
what
it
was
ay
ay
the
very
thing
surely
it
must
have
been
placed
here
on
purpose
by
the
people
the
fact
was
he
had
placed
his
hand
into
a
pot
of
pitch
that
had
been
left
by
the
people
who
had
been
at
work
at
pitching
the
pales
but
had
been
attracted
by
the
fire
at
sir
francis
varney's
and
to
see
which
they
had
left
their
work
and
the
pitch
was
left
on
a
smouldering
peat
fire
so
that
when
mr
jones
the
grocer
accidentally
put
his
hand
into
it
he
found
it
just
warm
when
he
made
this
discovery
he
dabbed
his
hand
again
into
the
pitch-pot
exclaiming--
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
and
he
endeavoured
to
secure
as
large
a
handful
of
the
slippery
and
sticky
stuff
as
he
could
and
this
done
he
set
off
to
come
up
with
the
big
countryman
who
had
done
him
so
much
indignity
and
made
his
stomach
uncomfortable
he
soon
came
up
with
him
for
the
man
had
stopped
rather
behind
and
was
larking
as
it
is
called
with
some
men
to
whom
he
was
a
companion
he
had
slipped
down
a
bank
and
was
partially
sitting
down
on
the
soft
mud
in
his
bustle
the
little
grocer
came
down
with
a
slide
close
to
the
big
countryman
ah--ah
my
little
grocer
said
the
countryman
holding
out
his
hand
to
catch
him
and
drawing
him
towards
himself
you
will
come
and
sit
down
by
the
side
of
your
old
friend
as
he
spoke
he
endeavoured
to
pull
mr
jones
down
too
but
that
individual
only
replied
by
fetching
the
countryman
a
swinging
smack
across
the
face
with
the
handful
of
pitch
there
take
that
and
now
we
are
quits
we
shall
be
old
friends
after
this
eh
are
you
satisfied
you'll
remember
me
i'll
warrant
as
the
grocer
spoke
he
rubbed
his
hands
over
the
face
of
the
fallen
man
and
then
rushed
from
the
spot
with
all
the
haste
he
could
make
the
countryman
sat
a
moment
or
two
confounded
cursing
and
swearing
and
spluttering
vowing
vengeance
believing
that
it
was
mud
only
that
had
been
plastered
over
his
face
but
when
he
put
his
hands
up
and
found
out
what
it
was
he
roared
and
bellowed
like
a
town-bull
he
cried
out
to
his
companions
that
his
eyes
were
pitched
but
they
only
laughed
at
him
thinking
he
was
having
some
foolish
lark
with
them
it
was
next
day
before
he
got
home
for
he
wandered
about
all
night
and
it
took
him
a
week
to
wash
the
pitch
off
by
means
of
grease
and
ever
afterwards
he
recollected
the
pitching
of
his
face
nor
did
he
ever
forget
the
grocer
thus
it
was
the
whole
party
returned
a
long
while
after
dark
across
the
fields
with
all
the
various
accidents
that
were
likely
to
befal
such
an
assemblage
of
people
the
vampyre
hunting
cost
many
of
them
dear
for
clothes
were
injured
on
all
sides
hats
lost
and
shoes
missing
in
a
manner
that
put
some
of
the
rioters
to
much
inconvenience
soon
afterwards
the
military
retired
to
their
quarters
and
the
townspeople
at
length
became
tranquil
and
nothing
more
was
heard
or
done
that
night
the
departure
of
the
bannerworths
from
the
hall--the
new
abode--jack
pringle
pilot
illustration
during
that
very
evening
on
which
the
house
of
sir
francis
varney
was
fired
by
the
mob
another
scene
and
one
of
different
character
was
enacted
at
bannerworth
hall
where
the
owners
of
that
ancient
place
were
departing
from
it
it
was
towards
the
latter
part
of
the
day
that
flora
bannerworth
mrs
bannerworth
and
henry
bannerworth
were
preparing
themselves
to
depart
from
the
house
of
their
ancestors
the
intended
proprietor
was
as
we
have
already
been
made
acquainted
with
the
old
admiral
who
had
taken
the
place
somewhat
mysteriously
considering
the
way
in
which
he
usually
did
business
the
admiral
was
walking
up
and
down
the
lawn
before
the
house
and
looking
up
at
the
windows
every
now
and
then
and
turning
to
jack
pringle
he
said--
jack
you
dog
ay--ay
sir
mind
you
convoy
these
women
into
the
right
port
do
you
hear
and
no
mistaking
the
bearings
do
you
hear
ay
ay
sir
these
crafts
want
care
and
you
are
pilot
commander
and
all
so
mind
and
keep
your
weather
eye
open
ay
ay
sir
i
knows
the
craft
well
enough
and
i
knows
the
roads
too
there'll
be
no
end
of
foundering
against
the
breakers
to
find
where
they
lie
no
no
jack
you
needn't
do
that
but
mind
your
bearings
jack
mind
your
bearings
never
fear
i
know
'em
well
enough
my
eyes
ain't
laid
up
in
ordinary
yet
eh
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
dog
eh
nothing
only
i
can
see
without
helps
to
read
or
glasses
either
so
i
know
one
place
from
another
there
was
now
some
one
moving
within
and
the
admiral
followed
by
jack
pringle
entered
the
hall
henry
bannerworth
was
there
they
were
all
ready
to
go
when
the
coach
came
for
them
which
the
admiral
had
ordered
for
them
jack
you
lubber
where
are
you
ay
ay
sir
here
am
i
go
and
station
yourself
up
in
some
place
where
you
can
keep
a
good
look-out
for
the
coach
and
come
and
report
when
you
see
it
ay--ay
sir
said
jack
and
away
he
went
from
the
room
and
stationed
himself
up
in
one
of
the
trees
that
commanded
a
good
view
of
the
main
road
for
some
distance
admiral
bell
said
henry
here
we
are
trusting
implicitly
to
you
and
in
doing
so
i
am
sure
i
am
doing
right
you
will
see
that
said
the
admiral
all's
fair
and
honest
as
yet
and
what
is
to
come
will
speak
for
itself
i
hope
you
won't
suffer
from
any
of
these
nocturnal
visits
said
henry
i
don't
much
care
about
them
but
old
admiral
bell
don't
strike
his
colours
to
an
enemy
however
ugly
he
may
look
no
no
it
must
be
a
better
craft
than
his
own
that'll
take
him
and
one
who
won't
run
away
but
that
will
grapple
yard-arm
and
yard-arm
you
know
why
admiral
you
must
have
seen
many
dangers
in
your
time
and
be
used
to
all
kinds
of
disturbances
and
conflicts
you
have
had
a
life
of
experience
yes
and
experience
has
come
pretty
thick
sometimes
i
can
tell
you
when
it
comes
in
the
shape
of
frenchmen's
broadsides
i
dare
say
then
it
must
be
rather
awkward
death
by
the
law
said
the
admiral
to
stop
one
of
them
with
your
head
i
assure
you
i
dare
not
make
the
attempt
myself
though
i
have
often
seen
it
done
i
dare
say
but
here
are
flora
and
my
mother
as
he
spoke
flora
and
her
mother
entered
the
apartment
well
admiral
we
are
all
ready
and
though
i
may
feel
somewhat
sorry
at
leaving
the
old
hall
yet
it
arises
from
attachment
to
the
place
and
not
any
disinclination
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
these
dreadful
alarms
and
i
too
shall
be
by
no
means
sorry
said
flora
i
am
sure
it
is
some
gratification
to
know
we
leave
a
friend
here
rather
than
some
others
who
would
have
had
the
place
if
they
could
have
got
it
by
any
means
ah
that's
true
enough
miss
flora
said
the
admiral
but
we'll
run
the
enemy
down
yet
depend
upon
it
but
once
away
you
will
be
free
from
these
terrors
and
now
as
you
have
promised
do
not
let
yourselves
be
seen
any
where
at
all
you
have
our
promises
admiral
and
they
shall
be
religiously
kept
i
can
assure
you
boat
ahoy--ahoy
shouted
jack
what
boat
said
the
admiral
surprised
and
then
he
muttered
confound
you
for
a
lubber
didn't
i
tell
you
to
mind
your
bearings
you
dog-fish
you
ay
ay
sir--and
so
i
did
you
did
yes
here
they
are
squint
over
the
larboard
bulk-heads
as
they
call
walls
and
then
atween
the
two
trees
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
course
then
straight
ahead
for
a
few
hundred
fathoms
when
you
come
to
a
funnel
as
is
smoking
like
the
crater
of
mount
vesuvius
and
then
in
a
line
with
that
on
the
top
of
the
hill
comes
our
boat
well
said
the
admiral
that'll
do
now
go
open
the
gates
and
keep
a
bright
look
out
and
if
you
see
anybody
near
your
watch
why
douse
their
glim
ay--ay
sir
said
jack
and
he
disappeared
rather
a
lucid
description
said
henry
as
he
thought
of
jack's
report
to
the
admiral
oh
it's
a
seaman's
report
i
know
what
he
means
it's
quicker
and
plainer
than
the
land
lingo
to
my
ears
and
jack
can't
talk
any
other
you
see
by
this
time
the
coach
came
into
the
yard
and
the
whole
party
descended
into
the
court-yard
where
they
came
to
take
leave
of
the
old
place
farewell
admiral
good
bye
said
the
admiral
i
hope
the
place
you
are
going
to
will
be
such
as
please
you--i
hope
it
will
i
am
sure
we
shall
endeavour
to
be
pleased
with
it
and
i
am
pretty
sure
we
shall
good
bye
farewell
admiral
bell
said
henry
you
remember
your
promises
i
do
good
bye
mr
chillingworth
good
bye
said
mr
chillingworth
who
came
up
to
bid
them
farewell
a
pleasant
journey
and
may
you
all
be
the
happier
for
it
you
do
not
come
with
us
no
i
have
some
business
of
importance
to
attend
to
else
i
should
have
the
greatest
pleasure
in
doing
so
but
good
bye
we
shall
not
be
long
apart
i
dare
say
i
hope
not
said
henry
the
door
of
the
carriage
was
shut
by
the
admiral
who
looked
round
saying--
jack--jack
pringle
where
are
you
you
dog
here
am
i
said
jack
where
have
you
been
to
only
been
for
pigtail
said
jack
i
forgot
it
and
couldn't
set
sail
without
it
you
dog
you
didn't
i
tell
you
to
mind
your
bearings
so
i
will
said
jack
fore
and
aft--fore
and
aft
admiral
you
had
better
said
the
admiral
who
however
relaxed
into
a
broad
grin
which
he
concealed
from
jack
pringle
jack
mounted
the
coach-box
and
away
it
went
just
as
it
was
getting
dark
the
old
admiral
had
locked
up
all
the
rooms
in
the
presence
of
henry
bannerworth
and
when
the
coach
had
gone
out
of
sight
mr
chillingworth
came
back
to
the
hall
where
he
joined
the
admiral
well
he
said
they
are
gone
admiral
bell
and
we
are
alone
we
have
a
clear
stage
and
no
favour
the
two
things
of
all
others
i
most
desire
now
they
will
be
strangers
where
they
are
going
to
and
that
will
be
something
gained
i
will
endeavour
to
do
some
thing
if
i
get
yard-arm
and
yard-arm
with
these
pirates
i'll
make
'em
feel
the
weight
of
true
metal
i'll
board
'em--d----e
i'll
do
everything
everything
that
can
be
done
ay--ay





the
coach
in
which
the
family
of
the
bannerworths
were
carried
away
continued
its
course
without
any
let
or
hindrance
and
they
met
no
one
on
their
road
during
the
whole
drive
the
fact
was
nearly
everybody
was
at
the
conflagration
at
sir
francis
varney's
house
flora
knew
not
which
way
they
were
going
and
after
a
time
all
trace
of
the
road
was
lost
darkness
set
in
and
they
all
sat
in
silence
in
the
coach
at
length
after
some
time
had
been
spent
thus
flora
bannerworth
turned
to
jack
pringle
and
said--
are
we
near
or
have
we
much
further
to
go
not
very
much
ma'am
said
jack
all's
right
however--ship
in
the
direct
course
and
no
breakers
ahead--no
lookout
necessary
however
there's
a
land-lubber
aloft
to
keep
a
look
out
as
this
was
not
very
intelligible
and
jack
seemed
to
have
his
own
reasons
for
silence
they
asked
him
no
further
questions
but
in
about
three-quarters
of
an
hour
during
which
time
the
coach
had
been
driving
through
the
trees
they
came
to
a
standstill
by
a
sudden
pull
of
the
check-string
from
jack
who
said--
hilloa--take
in
sails
and
drop
anchor
is
this
the
place
yes
here
we
are
said
jack
we're
in
port
now
at
all
events
and
he
began
to
sing--
the
trials
and
the
dangers
of
the
voyage
is
past
when
the
coach
door
opened
and
they
all
got
out
and
looked
about
them
where
they
were
up
the
garden
if
you
please
ma'am--as
quick
as
you
can
the
night
air
is
very
cold
flora
and
her
mother
and
brother
took
the
hint
which
was
meant
by
jack
to
mean
that
they
were
not
to
be
seen
outside
they
at
once
entered
a
pretty
garden
and
then
they
came
to
a
very
neat
and
picturesque
cottage
they
had
no
time
to
look
up
at
it
as
the
door
was
immediately
opened
by
an
elderly
female
who
was
intended
to
wait
upon
them
soon
after
jack
pringle
and
the
coachman
entered
the
passage
with
the
small
amount
of
luggage
which
they
had
brought
with
them
this
was
deposited
in
the
passage
and
then
jack
went
out
again
and
after
a
few
minutes
there
was
the
sound
of
wheels
which
intimated
that
the
coach
had
driven
off
jack
however
returned
in
a
few
minutes
afterwards
having
secured
the
wicket-gate
at
the
end
of
the
garden
and
then
entered
the
house
shutting
the
door
carefully
after
him
flora
and
her
mother
looked
over
the
apartments
in
which
they
were
shown
with
some
surprise
it
was
in
everything
such
as
they
could
wish
indeed
though
it
could
not
be
termed
handsomely
or
extravagantly
furnished
or
that
the
things
were
new
yet
there
was
all
that
convenience
and
comfort
could
require
and
some
little
of
the
luxuries
well
said
flora
this
is
very
thoughtful
of
the
admiral
the
place
will
really
be
charming
and
the
garden
too
delightful
mustn't
be
made
use
of
just
now
said
jack
if
you
please
ma'am
them's
the
orders
at
present
very
well
said
flora
smiling
i
suppose
mr
pringle
we
must
obey
them
jack
pringle
if
you
please
said
jack
my
commands
only
temporary
i
ain't
got
a
commission
the
lonely
watch
and
the
adventure
in
the
deserted
house
illustration
it
is
now
quite
night
and
so
peculiar
and
solemn
a
stillness
reigns
in
and
about
bannerworth
hall
and
its
surrounding
grounds
that
one
might
have
supposed
it
a
place
of
the
dead
deserted
completely
after
sunset
by
all
who
would
still
hold
kindred
with
the
living
there
was
not
a
breath
of
air
stirring
and
this
circumstance
added
greatly
to
the
impression
of
profound
repose
which
the
whole
scene
exhibited
the
wind
during
the
day
had
been
rather
of
a
squally
character
but
towards
nightfall
as
is
often
usual
after
a
day
of
such
a
character
it
had
completely
lulled
and
the
serenity
of
the
scene
was
unbroken
even
by
the
faintest
sigh
from
a
wandering
zephyr
the
moon
rose
late
at
that
period
and
as
is
always
the
case
at
that
interval
between
sunset
and
the
rising
of
that
luminary
which
makes
the
night
so
beautiful
the
darkness
was
of
the
most
profound
character
it
was
one
of
those
nights
to
produce
melancholy
reflections--a
night
on
which
a
man
would
be
apt
to
review
his
past
life
and
to
look
into
the
hidden
recesses
of
his
soul
to
see
if
conscience
could
make
a
coward
of
him
in
the
loneliness
and
stillness
that
breathed
around
it
was
one
of
those
nights
in
which
wanderers
in
the
solitude
of
nature
feel
that
the
eye
of
heaven
is
upon
them
and
on
which
there
seems
to
be
a
more
visible
connection
between
the
world
and
its
great
creator
than
upon
ordinary
occasions
the
solemn
and
melancholy
appear
places
once
instinct
with
life
when
deserted
by
those
familiar
forms
and
faces
that
have
long
inhabited
them
there
is
no
desert
no
uninhabited
isle
in
the
far
ocean
no
wild
barren
pathless
tract
of
unmitigated
sterility
which
could
for
one
moment
compare
in
point
of
loneliness
and
desolation
to
a
deserted
city
strip
london
mighty
and
majestic
as
it
is
of
the
busy
swarm
of
humanity
that
throng
its
streets
its
suburbs
its
temples
its
public
edifices
and
its
private
dwellings
and
how
awful
would
be
the
walk
of
one
solitary
man
throughout
its
noiseless
thoroughfares
illustration
if
madness
seized
not
upon
him
ere
he
had
been
long
the
sole
survivor
of
a
race
it
would
need
be
cast
in
no
common
mould
and
to
descend
from
great
things
to
smaller--from
the
huge
leviathan
city
to
one
mansion
far
removed
from
the
noise
and
bustle
of
conventional
life
we
may
imagine
the
sort
of
desolation
that
reigned
through
bannerworth
hall
when
for
the
first
time
after
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
occupation
it
was
deserted
by
the
representatives
of
that
family
so
many
members
of
which
had
lived
and
died
beneath
its
roof
the
house
and
everything
within
without
and
around
it
seemed
actually
to
sympathize
with
its
own
desolation
and
desertion
it
seemed
as
if
twenty
years
of
continued
occupation
could
not
have
produced
such
an
effect
upon
the
ancient
edifice
as
had
those
few
hours
of
neglect
and
desertion
and
yet
it
was
not
as
if
it
had
been
stripped
of
those
time-worn
and
ancient
relics
of
ornament
and
furnishing
that
so
long
had
appertained
to
it
no
nothing
but
the
absence
of
those
forms
which
had
been
accustomed
quietly
to
move
from
room
to
room
and
to
be
met
here
upon
a
staircase
there
upon
a
corridor
and
even
in
some
of
the
ancient
panelled
apartments
which
give
it
an
air
of
dreary
repose
and
listlessness
the
shutters
too
were
all
closed
and
that
circumstance
contributed
largely
to
the
production
of
that
gloomy
effect
which
otherwise
could
not
have
ensued
in
fact
what
could
be
done
without
attracting
very
special
observation
was
done
to
prove
to
any
casual
observer
that
the
house
was
untenanted
but
such
was
not
really
the
case
in
that
very
room
where
the
much
dreaded
varney
the
vampyre
had
made
one
of
his
dreaded
appearances
to
flora
bannerworth
and
her
mother
sat
two
men
it
was
from
that
apartment
that
flora
had
discharged
the
pistol
which
had
been
left
to
her
by
her
brother
and
the
shot
from
which
it
was
believed
by
the
whole
family
had
most
certainly
taken
effect
upon
the
person
of
the
vampyre
it
was
a
room
peculiarly
accessible
from
the
gardens
for
it
had
long
french
windows
opening
to
the
very
ground
and
but
a
stone
step
intervened
between
the
flooring
of
the
apartment
and
a
broad
gravel
walk
which
wound
round
that
entire
portion
of
the
house
it
was
in
this
room
then
that
two
men
sat
in
silence
and
nearly
in
darkness
before
them
and
on
a
table
were
several
articles
of
refreshment
as
well
of
defence
and
offence
according
as
their
intentions
might
be
there
were
a
bottle
and
three
glasses
and
lying
near
the
elbow
of
one
of
the
men
was
a
large
pair
of
pistols
such
as
might
have
adorned
the
belt
of
some
desperate
character
who
wished
to
instil
an
opinion
of
his
prowess
into
his
foes
by
the
magnitude
of
his
weapons
close
at
hand
by
the
same
party
lay
some
more
modern
fire
arms
as
well
as
a
long
dirk
with
a
silver
mounted
handle
the
light
they
had
consisted
of
a
large
lantern
so
constructed
with
a
slide
that
it
could
be
completely
obscured
at
a
moment's
notice
but
now
as
it
was
placed
the
rays
that
were
allowed
to
come
from
it
were
directed
as
much
from
the
window
of
the
apartment
as
possible
and
fell
upon
the
faces
of
the
two
men
revealing
them
to
be
admiral
bell
and
dr
chillingworth
it
might
have
been
the
effect
of
the
particular
light
in
which
he
sat
but
the
doctor
looked
extremely
pale
and
did
not
appear
at
all
at
his
ease
the
admiral
on
the
contrary
appeared
in
as
placable
a
state
of
mind
as
possible
and
had
his
arms
folded
across
his
breast
and
his
head
shrunk
down
between
his
shoulders
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
something
that
was
to
last
a
long
time
and
therefore
he
was
making
the
best
of
it
i
do
hope
said
mr
chillingworth
after
a
long
pause
that
our
efforts
will
be
crowned
with
success--you
know
my
dear
sir
that
i
have
always
been
of
your
opinion
that
there
was
a
great
deal
more
in
this
matter
than
met
the
eye
to
be
sure
said
the
admiral
and
as
to
our
efforts
being
crowned
with
success
why
i'll
give
you
a
toast
doctor
'may
the
morning's
reflection
provide
for
the
evening's
amusement'
ha
ha
said
chillingworth
faintly
i'd
rather
not
drink
any
more
and
you
seem
admiral
to
have
transposed
the
toast
in
some
way
i
believe
it
runs
'may
the
evening's
amusement
bear
the
morning's
reflection'
transpose
the
devil
said
the
admiral
what
do
i
care
how
it
runs
i
gave
you
my
toast
and
as
to
that
you
mention
it's
another
one
altogether
and
a
sneaking
shore-going
one
too
but
why
don't
you
drink
why
my
dear
sir
medically
speaking
i
am
strongly
of
opinion
that
when
the
human
stomach
is
made
to
contain
a
large
quantity
of
alcohol
it
produces
bad
effects
upon
the
system
now
i've
certainly
taken
one
glass
of
this
infernally
strong
hollands
and
it
is
now
lying
in
my
stomach
like
the
red-hot
heater
of
a
tea-urn
is
it
put
it
out
with
another
then
ay
i'm
afraid
that
would
not
answer
but
do
you
really
think
admiral
that
we
shall
effect
anything
by
waiting
here
and
keeping
watch
and
ward
not
under
the
most
comfortable
circumstances
this
first
night
of
the
hall
being
empty
well
i
don't
know
that
we
shall
said
the
admiral
but
when
you
really
want
to
steal
a
march
upon
the
enemy
there
is
nothing
like
beginning
betimes
we
are
both
of
opinion
that
varney's
great
object
throughout
has
been
by
some
means
or
another
to
get
possession
of
the
house
yes
true
true
we
know
that
he
has
been
unceasing
in
his
endeavours
to
get
the
bannerworth
family
out
of
it
that
he
has
offered
them
their
own
price
to
become
its
tenant
and
that
the
whole
gist
of
his
quiet
and
placid
interview
with
flora
in
the
garden
was
to
supply
her
with
a
new
set
of
reasons
for
urging
her
mother
and
brother
to
leave
bannerworth
hall
because
the
old
ones
were
certainly
not
found
sufficient
true
true
most
true
said
mr
chillingworth
emphatically
you
know
sir
that
from
the
first
time
you
broached
that
view
of
the
subject
to
me
how
entirely
i
coincided
with
you
of
course
you
did
for
you
are
a
honest
fellow
and
a
right-thinking
fellow
though
you
are
a
doctor
and
i
don't
know
that
i
like
doctors
much
better
than
i
like
lawyers--they're
only
humbugs
in
a
different
sort
of
way
but
i
wish
to
be
liberal
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
honest
lawyer
and
d----e
you're
an
honest
doctor
of
course
i'm
much
obliged
admiral
for
your
good
opinion
i
only
wish
it
had
struck
me
to
bring
something
of
a
solid
nature
in
the
shape
of
food
to
sustain
the
waste
of
the
animal
economy
during
the
hours
we
shall
have
to
wait
here
don't
trouble
yourself
about
that
said
the
admiral
do
you
think
i'm
a
donkey
and
would
set
out
on
a
cruise
without
victualling
my
ship
i
should
think
not
jack
pringle
will
be
here
soon
and
he
has
my
orders
to
bring
in
something
to
eat
well
said
the
doctor
that's
very
provident
of
you
admiral
and
i
feel
personally
obliged
but
tell
me
how
do
you
intend
to
conduct
the
watch
what
do
you
mean
why
i
mean
if
we
sit
here
with
the
window
fastened
so
as
to
prevent
our
light
from
being
seen
and
the
door
closed
how
are
we
by
any
possibility
to
know
if
the
house
is
attacked
or
not
hark'ee
my
friend
said
the
admiral
i've
left
a
weak
point
for
the
enemy
a
what
admiral
a
weak
point
i've
taken
good
care
to
secure
everything
but
one
of
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
and
that
i've
left
open
or
so
nearly
open
that
it
will
look
like
the
most
natural
place
in
the
world
to
get
in
at
now
just
inside
that
window
i've
placed
a
lot
of
the
family
crockery
i'll
warrant
if
anybody
so
much
as
puts
his
foot
in
you'll
hear
the
smash--and
d----e
there
it
is
there
was
a
loud
crash
at
this
moment
followed
by
a
succession
of
similar
sounds
but
of
a
lesser
degree
and
both
the
admiral
and
mr
chillingworth
sprung
to
their
feet
come
on
cried
the
former
here'll
be
a
precious
row--take
the
lantern
mr
chillingworth
did
so
but
he
did
not
seem
possessed
of
a
great
deal
of
presence
of
mind
for
before
they
got
out
of
the
room
he
twice
accidentally
put
on
the
dark
slide
and
produced
a
total
darkness
d--n
said
the
admiral
don't
make
it
wink
and
wink
in
that
way
hold
it
up
and
run
after
me
as
hard
as
you
can
i'm
coming
i'm
coming
said
mr
chillingworth
it
was
one
of
the
windows
of
a
long
room
containing
five
fronting
the
garden
which
the
admiral
had
left
purposely
unguarded
and
it
was
not
far
from
the
apartment
in
which
they
had
been
sitting
so
that
probably
not
half
a
minute's
time
elapsed
between
the
moment
of
the
first
alarm
and
their
reaching
the
spot
from
whence
it
was
presumed
to
arise
the
admiral
had
armed
himself
with
one
of
the
huge
pistols
and
he
dashed
forward
with
all
the
vehemence
of
his
character
towards
the
window
where
he
knew
he
had
placed
the
family
crockery
and
where
he
fully
expected
to
meet
the
reward
of
his
exertion
by
discovering
some
one
lying
amid
its
fragments
in
this
however
he
was
disappointed
for
although
there
was
evidently
a
great
smash
amongst
the
plates
and
dishes
the
window
remained
closed
and
there
was
no
indication
whatever
of
the
presence
of
any
one
well
that's
odd
said
the
admiral
i
balanced
them
up
amazingly
careful
and
two
of
'em
edgeways--d---e
a
fly
would
have
knocked
them
down
mew
said
a
great
cat
emerging
from
under
a
chair
curse
you
there
you
are
said
the
admiral
put
out
the
light
put
out
the
light
here
we're
illuminating
the
whole
house
for
nothing
with
a
click
went
the
darkening
slide
over
the
lantern
and
all
was
obscurity
at
that
instant
a
shrill
clear
whistle
came
from
the
garden
the
arrival
of
jack
pringle--midnight
and
the
vampyre--the
mysterious
hat
illustration
bless
me
what
is
that
said
mr
chillingworth
what
a
very
singular
sound
hold
your
noise
said
the
admiral
did
you
never
hear
that
before
no
how
should
i
lor
bless
the
ignorance
of
some
people
that's
a
boatswain's
call
oh
it
is
said
mr
chillingworth
is
he
going
to
call
again
d----e
i
tell
ye
it's
a
boatswain's
call
well
then
d----e
if
it
comes
to
that
said
mr
chillingworth
what
does
he
call
here
for
the
admiral
disdained
an
answer
but
demanding
the
lantern
he
opened
it
so
that
there
was
a
sufficient
glimmering
of
light
to
guide
him
and
then
walked
from
the
room
towards
the
front
door
of
the
hall
he
asked
no
questions
before
he
opened
it
because
no
doubt
the
signal
was
preconcerted
and
jack
pringle
for
it
was
he
indeed
who
had
arrived
at
once
walked
in
and
the
admiral
barred
the
door
with
the
same
precision
with
which
it
was
before
secured
well
jack
he
said
did
you
see
anybody
ay
ay
sir
said
jack
why
ye
don't
mean
that--where
where
i
bought
the
grub
a
woman--
d----e
you're
a
fool
jack
you're
another
hilloa
ye
scoundrel
what
d'ye
mean
by
talking
to
me
in
that
way
is
this
your
respect
for
your
superiors
ship's
been
paid
off
long
ago
said
jack
and
i
ain't
got
no
superiors
i
ain't
a
marine
or
a
frenchman
why
you're
drunk
i
know
it
put
that
in
your
eye
there's
a
scoundrel
why
you
know-nothing-lubber
didn't
i
tell
you
to
be
careful
and
that
everything
depended
upon
secrecy
and
caution
and
didn't
i
tell
you
above
all
this
to
avoid
drink
to
be
sure
you
did
and
yet
you
come
here
like
a
rum
cask
yes
now
you've
had
your
say
what
then
you'd
better
leave
him
alone
said
mr
chillingworth
it's
no
use
arguing
with
a
drunken
man
harkye
admiral
said
jack
steadying
himself
as
well
as
he
could
i've
put
up
with
you
a
precious
long
while
but
i
won't
no
longer
you're
so
drunk
now
that
you
keeping
bobbing
up
and
down
like
the
mizen
gaff
in
a
storm--that's
my
opinion--tol
de
rol
let
him
alone
let
him
alone
urged
mr
chillingworth
the
villain
said
the
admiral
he's
enough
to
ruin
everything
now
who
would
have
thought
that
but
it's
always
been
the
way
with
him
for
a
matter
of
twenty
years--he
never
had
any
judgment
in
his
drink
when
it
was
all
smooth
sailing
and
nothing
to
do
and
the
fellow
might
have
got
an
extra
drop
on
board
which
nobody
would
have
cared
for
he's
as
sober
as
a
judge
but
whenever
there's
anything
to
do
that
wants
a
little
cleverness
confound
him
he
ships
rum
enough
to
float
a
seventy-four
are
you
going
to
stand
anything
to
drink
said
jack
my
old
buffer
do
you
recollect
where
you
got
your
knob
scuttled
off
beyrout--how
you
fell
on
your
latter
end
and
tried
to
recollect
your
church
cateckis
you
old
brute--i's
ashamed
of
you
do
you
recollect
the
brown
girl
you
bought
for
thirteen
bob
and
a
tanner
at
the
blessed
society
islands
and
sold
her
again
for
a
dollar
to
a
nigger
seven
feet
two
in
his
natural
pumps
you're
a
nice
article
you
is
to
talk
of
marines
and
swabs
and
shore-going
lubbers
blow
yer
do
you
recollect
the
little
frenchman
that
told
ye
he'd
pull
your
blessed
nose
and
i
advised
you
to
soap
it
do
you
recollect
sall
at
spithead
as
you
got
in
at
a
port
hole
of
the
state
cabin
all
but
her
behind
death
and
the
devil
said
the
admiral
breaking
from
the
grasp
of
mr
chillingworth
ay
said
jack
you'll
come
to
'em
both
one
of
these
days
old
cock
and
no
mistake
i'll
have
his
life
i'll
have
his
life
roared
the
admiral
nay
nay
sir
said
mr
chillingworth
catching
the
admiral
round
the
waist
my
dear
sir
recollect
now
if
i
may
venture
to
advise
you
admiral
bell
there's
a
lot
of
that
fiery
hollands
you
know
in
the
next
room
set
firm
down
to
that
and
finish
him
off
i'll
warrant
him
he'll
be
quiet
enough
what's
that
you
say
cried
jack--hollands--who's
got
any--next
to
rum
and
elizabeth
baker
if
i
has
an
affection
it's
hollands
jack
said
the
admiral
ay
ay
sir
said
jack
instinctively
come
this
way
jack
staggered
after
him
and
they
all
reached
the
room
where
the
admiral
and
mr
chillingworth
had
been
sitting
before
the
alarm
there
said
the
admiral
putting
the
light
upon
the
table
and
pointing
to
the
bottle
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
never
thinks
under
such
circumstances
said
jack
here's
to
the
wooden
walls
of
old
england
he
seized
the
bottle
and
putting
its
neck
into
his
mouth
for
a
few
moments
nothing
was
heard
but
a
gurgling
sound
of
the
liquor
passing
down
his
throat
his
head
went
further
and
further
back
until
at
last
over
he
went
chair
and
bottle
and
all
and
lay
in
a
helpless
state
of
intoxication
on
the
floor
so
far
so
good
said
the
admiral
he's
out
of
the
way
at
all
events
i'll
just
loosen
his
neckcloth
said
mr
chillingworth
and
then
we'll
go
and
sit
somewhere
else
and
i
should
recommend
that
if
anywhere
we
take
up
our
station
in
that
chamber
once
flora's
where
the
mysterious
panelled
portrait
hangs
that
bears
so
strong
a
resemblance
to
varney
the
vampyre
hush
said
the
admiral
what's
that
they
listened
for
a
moment
intently
and
then
distinctly
upon
the
gravel
path
outside
the
window
they
heard
a
footstep
as
if
some
person
were
walking
along
not
altogether
heedlessly
but
yet
without
any
very
great
amount
of
caution
or
attention
to
the
noise
he
might
make
hist
said
the
doctor
not
a
word
they
come
what
do
you
say
they
for
said
the
admiral
because
something
seems
to
whisper
me
that
mr
marchdale
knows
more
of
varney
the
vampyre
than
ever
he
has
chosen
to
reveal
put
out
the
light
yes
yes--that'll
do
the
moon
has
risen
see
how
it
streams
through
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
no
no--it's
not
in
that
direction
or
our
light
would
have
betrayed
us
do
you
not
see
the
beams
come
from
that
half
glass-door
leading
to
the
greenhouse
yes
and
there's
the
footstep
again
or
another
tramp
tramp
came
a
footfall
again
upon
the
gravel
path
and
as
before
died
away
upon
their
listening
ears
what
do
you
say
now
said
mr
chillingworth--are
there
not
two
if
they
were
a
dozen
said
the
admiral
although
we
have
lost
one
of
our
force
i
would
tackle
them
let's
creep
on
through
the
rooms
in
the
direction
the
footsteps
went
my
life
on
it
said
mr
chillingworth
as
they
left
the
apartment
if
this
be
varney
he
makes
for
that
apartment
where
flora
slept
and
which
he
knows
how
to
get
admission
to
i've
studied
the
house
well
admiral
and
to
get
to
that
window
any
one
from
here
outside
must
take
a
considerable
round
come
on--we
shall
be
beforehand
a
good
idea--a
good
idea
be
it
so
just
allowing
themselves
sufficient
light
to
guide
them
on
the
way
from
the
lantern
they
hurried
on
with
as
much
precipitation
as
the
intricacies
of
the
passage
would
allow
nor
halted
till
they
had
reached
the
chamber
were
hung
the
portrait
which
bore
so
striking
and
remarkable
a
likeness
to
varney
the
vampyre
they
left
the
lamp
outside
the
door
so
that
not
even
a
straggling
beam
from
it
could
betray
that
there
were
persons
on
the
watch
and
then
as
quietly
as
foot
could
fall
they
took
up
their
station
among
the
hangings
of
the
antique
bedstead
which
has
been
before
alluded
to
in
this
work
as
a
remarkable
piece
of
furniture
appertaining
to
that
apartment
do
you
think
said
the
admiral
we've
distanced
them
certainly
we
have
it's
unlucky
that
the
blind
of
the
window
is
down
is
it
by
heaven
there's
a
d----d
strange-looking
shadow
creeping
over
it
mr
chillingworth
looked
almost
with
suspended
breath
even
he
could
not
altogether
get
rid
of
a
tremulous
feeling
as
he
saw
that
the
shadow
of
a
human
form
apparently
of
very
large
dimensions
was
on
the
outside
with
the
arms
spread
out
as
if
feeling
for
some
means
of
opening
the
window
it
would
have
been
easy
now
to
have
fired
one
of
the
pistols
direct
upon
the
figure
but
somehow
or
another
both
the
admiral
and
mr
chillingworth
shrank
from
that
course
and
they
felt
much
rather
inclined
to
capture
whoever
might
make
his
appearance
only
using
their
pistols
as
a
last
resource
than
gratuitously
and
at
once
to
resort
to
violence
who
should
you
say
that
was
whispered
the
admiral
varney
the
vampyre
d----e
he's
ill-looking
and
big
enough
for
anything--there's
a
noise
there
was
a
strange
cracking
sound
at
the
window
as
if
a
pane
of
glass
was
being
very
stealthily
and
quietly
broken
and
then
the
blind
was
agitated
slightly
confusing
much
the
shadow
that
was
cast
upon
it
as
if
the
hand
of
some
person
was
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
a
complete
entrance
into
the
apartment
he's
coming
in
whispered
the
admiral
hush
for
heaven's
sake
said
mr
chillingworth
you
will
alarm
him
and
we
shall
lose
the
fruit
of
all
the
labour
we
have
already
bestowed
upon
the
matter
but
did
you
not
say
something
admiral
about
lying
under
the
window
and
catching
him
by
the
leg
why
yes
i
did
go
and
do
it
then
for
as
sure
as
you
are
a
living
man
his
leg
will
be
in
in
a
minute
here
goes
said
the
admiral
i
never
suggest
anything
which
i'm
unwilling
to
do
myself
whoever
it
was
that
now
was
making
such
strenuous
exertions
to
get
into
the
apartment
seemed
to
find
some
difficulty
as
regarded
the
fastenings
of
the
window
and
as
this
difficulty
increased
the
patience
of
the
party
as
well
as
his
caution
deserted
him
and
the
casement
was
rattled
with
violence
with
a
far
greater
amount
of
caution
than
any
one
from
a
knowledge
of
his
character
would
have
given
him
credit
for
the
admiral
crept
forward
and
laid
himself
exactly
under
the
window
the
depth
of
wood-work
from
the
floor
to
the
lowest
part
of
the
window-frame
did
not
exceed
above
two
feet
so
that
any
one
could
conveniently
step
in
from
the
balcony
outride
on
to
the
floor
of
the
apartment
which
was
just
what
he
who
was
attempting
to
effect
an
entrance
was
desirous
of
doing
it
was
quite
clear
that
be
he
who
he
might
mortal
or
vampyre
he
had
some
acquaintance
with
the
fastening
of
the
window
for
now
he
succeeded
in
moving
it
and
the
sash
was
thrown
open
the
blind
was
still
an
obstacle
but
a
vigorous
pull
from
the
intruder
brought
that
down
on
the
prostrate
admiral
and
then
mr
chillingworth
saw
by
the
moonlight
a
tall
gaunt
figure
standing
in
the
balcony
as
if
just
hesitating
for
a
moment
whether
to
get
head
first
or
feet
first
into
the
apartment
had
he
chosen
the
former
alternative
he
would
need
indeed
to
have
been
endowed
with
more
than
mortal
powers
of
defence
and
offence
to
escape
capture
but
his
lucky
star
was
in
the
ascendancy
and
he
put
his
foot
in
first
he
turned
his
side
to
the
apartment
and
as
he
did
so
the
blight
moonlight
fell
upon
his
face
enabling
mr
chillingworth
to
see
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
it
was
indeed
varney
the
vampyre
who
was
thus
stealthily
making
his
entrance
into
bannerworth
hall
according
to
the
calculation
which
had
been
made
by
the
admiral
upon
that
subject
the
doctor
scarcely
knew
whether
to
be
pleased
or
not
at
this
discovery
it
was
almost
a
terrifying
one
sceptical
as
he
was
upon
the
subject
of
vampyres
and
he
waited
breathless
for
the
issue
of
the
singular
and
perilous
adventure
no
doubt
admiral
bell
deeply
congratulated
himself
upon
the
success
which
was
about
to
crown
his
stratagem
for
the
capture
of
the
intruder
be
he
who
he
might
and
he
writhed
with
impatience
for
the
foot
to
come
sufficiently
near
him
to
enable
him
to
grasp
it
his
patience
was
not
severely
tried
for
in
another
moment
it
rested
upon
his
chest
boarders
a
hoy
shouted
the
admiral
and
at
once
he
laid
hold
of
the
trespasser
yard-arm
to
yard-arm
i
think
i've
got
you
now
here's
a
prize
doctor
he
shall
go
away
without
his
leg
if
he
goes
away
now
eh
what
the
light--d----e
he
has--doctor
the
light
the
light
why
what's
this--hilloa
there
dr
chillingworth
sprang
into
the
passage
and
procured
the
light--in
another
moment
he
was
at
the
side
of
the
admiral
and
the
lantern
slide
being
thrown
back
he
saw
at
once
the
dilemma
into
which
his
friend
had
fallen
there
he
lay
upon
his
back
grasping
with
the
vehemence
of
an
embrace
that
had
in
it
much
of
the
ludicrous
a
long
boot
from
which
the
intruder
had
cleverly
slipped
his
leg
leaving
it
as
a
poor
trophy
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
why
you've
only
pulled
his
boot
off
said
the
doctor
and
now
he's
gone
for
good
for
he
knows
what
we're
about
and
has
slipped
through
your
fingers
admiral
bell
sat
up
and
looked
at
the
boot
with
a
rueful
countenance
done
again
he
said
yes
you
are
done
said
the
doctor
why
didn't
you
lay
hold
of
the
leg
while
you
were
about
it
instead
of
the
boot
admiral
are
these
your
tactics
don't
be
a
fool
said
the
admiral
put
out
the
light
and
give
me
the
pistols
or
blaze
away
yourself
into
the
garden
a
chance
shot
may
do
something
it's
no
use
running
after
him
a
stern
chase
is
a
long
chase
but
fire
away
as
if
some
parties
below
had
heard
him
give
the
word
two
loud
reports
from
the
garden
immediately
ensued
and
a
crash
of
glass
testified
to
the
fact
that
some
deadly
missile
had
entered
the
room
murder
said
the
doctor
and
he
fell
flat
upon
his
back
i
don't
like
this
at
all
it's
all
in
your
line
admiral
but
not
in
mine
all's
right
my
lad
said
the
admiral
now
for
it
he
saw
lying
in
the
moonlight
the
pistols
which
he
and
the
doctor
had
brought
into
the
room
and
in
another
moment
he
to
use
his
own
words
returned
the
broadside
of
the
enemy
d--n
it
he
said
this
puts
me
in
mind
of
old
times
blaze
away
you
thieves
while
i
load
broadside
to
broadside
it's
your
turn
now
i
scorn
to
take
an
advantage
what
the
devil's
that
something
very
large
and
very
heavy
came
bang
against
the
window
sending
it
all
into
the
room
and
nearly
smothering
the
admiral
with
the
fragments
another
shot
was
then
fired
and
in
came
something
else
which
hit
the
wall
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
rebounding
from
thence
on
to
the
doctor
who
gave
a
yell
of
despair
after
that
all
was
still
the
enemy
seemed
to
be
satisfied
that
they
had
silenced
the
garrison
and
it
took
the
admiral
a
great
deal
of
kicking
and
plunging
to
rescue
himself
from
some
superincumbent
mass
that
was
upon
him
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
considerable
sized
tree
call
this
fair
fighting
he
shouted--getting
a
man's
legs
and
arms
tangled
up
like
a
piece
of
indian
matting
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
doctor
i
say
hilloa
where
are
you
i
don't
know
said
the
doctor
but
there's
somebody
getting
into
the
balcony--now
we
shall
be
murdered
in
cold
blood
where's
the
pistols
fired
off
of
course
you
did
it
yourself
bang
came
something
else
into
the
room
which
from
the
sound
it
made
closely
resembled
a
brick
and
after
that
somebody
jumped
clean
into
the
centre
of
the
floor
and
then
after
rolling
and
writhing
about
in
a
most
singular
manner
slowly
got
up
and
with
various
preliminary
hiccups
said--
come
on
you
lubbers
many
of
you
as
like
i'm
the
tar
for
all
weathers
why
d----e
said
the
admiral
it's
jack
pringle
yes
it
is
said
jack
who
was
not
sufficiently
sober
to
recognise
the
admiral's
voice
i
sees
as
how
you've
heard
of
me
come
on
all
of
you
why
jack
you
scoundrel
roared
the
admiral
how
came
you
here
don't
you
know
me
i'm
your
admiral
you
horse-marine
eh
said
jack
ay--ay
sir
how
came
you
here
how
came
you
you
villain
boarded
the
enemy
the
enemy
who
you
boarded
was
us
and
hang
me
if
i
don't
think
you
haven't
been
pouring
broadsides
into
us
while
the
enemy
were
scudding
before
the
wind
in
another
direction
lor
said
jack
explain
you
scoundrel
directly--explain
well
that's
only
reasonable
said
jack
and
giving
a
heavier
lurch
than
usual
he
sat
down
with
a
great
bounce
upon
the
floor
you
see
it's
just
this
here--when
i
was
a
coming
of
course
i
heard
just
as
i
was
a
going
that
ere
as
made
me
come
all
in
consequence
of
somebody
a
going
or
for
to
come
you
see
admiral
doctor
cried
the
admiral
in
a
great
rage
just
help
me
out
of
this
entanglement
of
branches
and
i'll
rid
the
world
from
an
encumbrance
by
smashing
that
fellow
smash
yourself
said
jack
you
know
you're
drunk
my
dear
admiral
said
mr
chillingworth
laying
hold
of
one
of
his
legs
and
pulling
it
very
hard
which
brought
his
face
into
a
lot
of
brambles
we're
making
a
mess
of
this
business
murder
shouted
the
admiral
you
are
indeed
is
that
what
you
call
pulling
me
out
of
it
you've
stuck
me
fast
i'll
manage
it
said
jack
i've
seed
him
in
many
a
scrape
and
i've
seed
him
out
you
pull
me
doctor
and
i'll
pull
him
yo
hoy
jack
laid
hold
of
the
admiral
by
the
scuff
of
the
neck
and
the
doctor
laid
hold
of
jack
round
the
waist
the
consequence
of
which
was
that
he
was
dragged
out
from
the
branches
of
the
tree
which
seemed
to
have
been
thrown
into
the
room
and
down
fell
both
jack
and
the
doctor
at
this
instant
there
was
a
strange
hissing
sound
heard
below
the
window
then
there
was
a
sudden
loud
report
as
if
a
hand-grenade
had
gone
off
a
spectral
sort
of
light
gleamed
into
the
room
and
a
tall
gaunt-looking
figure
rose
slowly
up
in
the
balcony
beware
of
the
dead
said
a
voice
let
the
living
contend
with
the
living
the
dead
with
the
dead
beware
the
figure
disappeared
as
did
also
the
strange
spectral-looking
light
a
death-like
silence
ensued
and
the
cold
moonbeams
streamed
in
upon
the
floor
of
the
apartment
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
to
disturb
the
wrapped
repose
and
serenity
of
the
scene
the
warning--the
new
plan
of
operation--the
insulting
message
from
varney
illustration
so
much
of
the
night
had
been
consumed
in
these
operations
that
by
the
time
they
were
over
and
the
three
personages
who
lay
upon
the
floor
of
what
might
be
called
the
haunted
chamber
of
bannerworth
hall
even
had
they
now
been
disposed
to
seek
repose
would
have
had
a
short
time
to
do
so
before
the
daylight
would
have
streamed
in
upon
them
and
roused
them
to
the
bustle
of
waking
existence
it
may
be
well
believed
what
a
vast
amount
of
surprise
came
over
the
three
persons
in
that
chamber
at
the
last
little
circumstance
that
had
occurred
in
connection
with
the
night's
proceedings
there
was
nothing
which
had
preceded
that
that
did
not
resemble
a
genuine
attack
upon
the
premises
but
about
that
last
mysterious
appearance
with
its
curious
light
there
was
quite
enough
to
bother
the
admiral
and
jack
pringle
to
a
considerable
effect
whatever
might
be
the
effect
upon
mr
chillingworth
whose
profession
better
enabled
him
to
comprehend
chemically
what
would
produce
effects
that
no
doubt
astonished
them
amazingly
what
with
his
intoxication
and
the
violent
exercise
he
had
taken
jack
was
again
thoroughly
prostrate
while
the
admiral
could
not
have
looked
more
astonished
had
the
evil
one
himself
appeared
in
propria
persona
and
given
him
notice
to
quit
the
premises
he
was
however
the
first
to
speak
and
the
words
he
spoke
were
addressed
to
jack
to
whom
he
said--
jack
you
lubber
what
do
you
think
of
all
that
jack
however
was
too
far
gone
even
to
say
ay
ay
sir
and
mr
chillingworth
slowly
getting
himself
up
to
his
feet
approached
the
admiral
it's
hard
to
say
so
much
admiral
bell
he
said
but
it
strikes
me
that
whatever
object
this
sir
francis
varney
or
varney
the
vampyre
has
in
coming
into
bannerworth
hall
it
is
at
all
events
of
sufficient
importance
to
induce
him
to
go
any
length
and
not
to
let
even
a
life
to
stand
in
the
way
of
its
accomplishment
well
it
seems
so
said
the
admiral
for
i'll
be
hanged
if
i
can
make
head
or
tail
of
the
fellow
if
we
value
our
personal
safety
we
shall
hesitate
to
continue
a
perilous
adventure
which
i
think
can
end
only
in
defeat
if
not
in
death
but
we
don't
value
our
personal
safety
said
the
admiral
we've
got
into
the
adventure
and
i
don't
see
why
we
shouldn't
carry
it
out
it
may
be
growing
a
little
serious
but
what
of
that
for
the
sake
of
that
young
girl
flora
bannerworth
as
well
as
for
the
sake
of
my
nephew
charles
holland
i
will
see
the
end
of
this
affair
let
it
be
what
it
may
but
mind
you
mr
chillingworth
if
one
man
chooses
to
go
upon
a
desperate
service
that's
no
reason
why
he
should
ask
another
to
do
so
i
understand
you
said
mr
chillingworth
but
having
commenced
the
adventure
with
you
i
am
not
the
man
to
desert
you
in
it
we
have
committed
a
great
mistake
a
mistake
how
why
we
ought
to
have
watched
outside
the
house
instead
of
within
it
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
we
had
lain
in
wait
in
the
garden
we
should
have
been
in
a
better
position
to
have
accomplished
our
object
well
i
don't
know
doctor
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
jack
pringle
hadn't
made
such
a
fool
of
himself
we
should
have
managed
very
well
and
i
don't
know
now
how
he
came
to
behave
in
the
manner
he
did
nor
i
said
mr
chillingworth
but
at
all
events
so
far
as
the
result
goes
it
is
quite
clear
that
any
further
watching
in
this
house
for
the
appearance
of
sir
francis
varney
will
now
be
in
vain
he
has
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
keep
quiet
until
we
are
tired
out--a
fact
concerning
which
he
can
easily
obtain
information--and
then
he
immediately
without
trouble
walks
into
the
premises
to
his
own
satisfaction
but
what
the
deuce
can
he
want
upon
the
premises
that
question
admiral
induces
me
to
think
that
we
have
made
another
mistake
we
ought
not
to
have
attempted
to
surprise
sir
francis
varney
in
coming
into
bannerworth
hall
but
to
catch
him
as
he
came
out
illustration
well
there's
something
in
that
said
the
admiral
this
is
a
pretty
night's
business
to
be
sure
however
it
can't
be
helped
it's
done
and
there's
an
end
on't
and
now
as
the
morning
is
near
at
hand
i
certainly
must
confess
i
should
like
to
get
some
breakfast
although
i
don't
like
that
we
should
all
leave
the
house
together
why
said
mr
chillingworth
as
we
have
now
no
secret
to
keep
with
regard
to
our
being
here
because
the
principal
person
we
wished
to
keep
it
from
is
aware
of
it
i
think
we
cannot
do
better
than
send
at
once
for
henry
bannerworth
tell
him
of
the
non-success
of
the
effort
we
have
made
in
his
behalf
and
admit
him
at
once
into
our
consultation
of
what
is
next
to
be
done
agreed
agreed
i
think
that
without
troubling
him
we
might
have
captured
this
varney
but
that's
over
now
and
as
soon
as
jack
pringle
chooses
to
wake
up
again
i'll
send
him
to
the
bannerworths
with
a
message
ay
ay
sir
said
jack
suddenly
all's
right
why
you
vagabond
said
the
admiral
i
do
believe
you've
been
shamming
shamming
what
being
drunk
to
be
sure
lor
couldn't
do
it
said
jack
i'll
just
tell
you
how
it
was
i
wakened
up
and
found
myself
shut
in
somewhere
and
as
i
couldn't
get
out
of
the
door
i
thought
i'd
try
the
window
and
there
i
did
get
out
well
perhaps
i
wasn't
quite
the
thing
but
i
sees
two
people
in
the
garden
a
looking
up
at
this
ere
room
and
to
be
sure
i
thought
it
was
you
and
the
doctor
well
it
warn't
no
business
of
mine
to
interfere
so
i
seed
one
of
you
climb
up
the
balcony
as
i
thought
and
then
after
which
come
down
head
over
heels
with
such
a
run
that
i
thought
you
must
have
broken
your
neck
well
after
that
you
fired
a
couple
of
shots
in
and
then
after
that
i
made
sure
it
was
you
admiral
and
what
made
you
make
sure
of
that
why
because
you
scuttled
away
like
an
empty
tar-barrel
in
full
tide
confound
you
you
scoundrel
well
then
confound
you
if
it
comes
to
that
i
thought
i
was
doing
you
good
sarvice
and
that
the
enemy
was
here
when
all
the
while
it
turned
out
as
you
was
and
the
enemy
wasn't
and
the
enemy
was
outside
and
you
wasn't
but
who
threw
such
a
confounded
lot
of
things
into
the
room
why
i
did
of
course
i
had
but
one
pistol
and
when
i
fired
that
off
i
was
forced
to
make
up
a
broadside
with
what
i
could
was
there
ever
such
a
stupid
said
the
admiral
doctor
doctor
you
talked
of
us
making
two
mistakes
but
you
forgot
a
third
and
worse
one
still
and
that
was
the
bringing
such
a
lubberly
son
of
a
sea-cook
into
the
place
as
this
fellow
you're
another
said
jack
and
you
knows
it
well
well
said
mr
chillingworth
it's
no
use
continuing
it
admiral
jack
in
his
way
did
i
dare
say
what
he
considered
for
the
best
i
wish
he'd
do
then
what
he
considers
for
the
worst
next
time
perhaps
i
may
said
jack
and
then
you
will
be
served
out
above
a
bit
what
'ud
become
of
you
i
wonder
if
it
wasn't
for
me
i'm
as
good
as
a
mother
to
you
you
knows
that
you
old
babby
come
come
admiral
said
mr
chillingworth
come
down
to
the
garden-gate
it
is
now
just
upon
daybreak
and
the
probability
is
that
we
shall
not
be
long
there
before
we
see
some
of
the
country
people
who
will
get
us
anything
we
require
in
the
shape
of
refreshment
and
as
for
jack
he
seems
quite
sufficiently
recovered
now
to
go
to
the
bannerworths'
oh
i
can
go
said
jack
as
for
that
the
only
thing
as
puts
me
out
of
the
way
is
the
want
of
something
to
drink
my
constitution
won't
stand
what
they
call
temperance
living
or
nothing
with
the
chill
off
go
at
once
said
the
admiral
and
tell
mr
henry
bannerworth
that
we
are
here
but
do
not
tell
him
before
his
sister
or
his
mother
if
you
meet
anybody
on
the
road
send
them
here
with
a
cargo
of
victuals
it
strikes
me
that
a
good
comfortable
breakfast
wouldn't
be
at
all
amiss
doctor
how
rapidly
the
day
dawns
remarked
mr
chillingworth
as
he
walked
into
the
balcony
from
whence
varney
the
vampire
had
attempted
to
make
good
his
entrance
to
the
hall
just
as
he
spoke
and
before
jack
pringle
could
get
half
way
over
to
the
garden
gate
there
came
a
tremendous
ring
at
the
bell
which
was
suspended
over
it
a
view
of
that
gate
could
not
be
commanded
from
the
window
of
the
haunted
apartment
so
that
they
could
not
see
who
it
was
that
demanded
admission
as
jack
pringle
was
going
down
at
any
rate
they
saw
no
necessity
for
personal
interference
and
he
proved
that
there
was
not
by
presently
returning
with
a
note
which
he
said
had
been
thrown
over
the
gate
by
a
lad
who
then
scampered
off
with
all
the
speed
he
could
make
the
note
exteriorly
was
well
got
up
and
had
all
the
appearance
of
great
care
having
been
bestowed
upon
its
folding
and
sealing
it
was
duly
addressed
to
admiral
bell
bannerworth
hall
and
the
word
immediate
was
written
at
one
corner
the
admiral
after
looking
at
it
for
some
time
with
very
great
wonder
came
at
last
to
the
conclusion
that
probably
to
open
it
would
be
the
shortest
way
of
arriving
at
a
knowledge
of
who
had
sent
it
and
he
accordingly
did
so
the
note
was
as
follows--
my
dear
sir--feeling
assured
that
you
cannot
be
surrounded
with
those
means
and
appliances
for
comfort
in
the
hall
in
its
now
deserted
condition
which
you
have
a
right
to
expect
and
so
eminently
deserve
i
flatter
myself
that
i
shall
receive
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
when
i
request
the
favour
of
your
company
to
breakfast
as
well
as
that
of
your
learned
friend
mr
chillingworth
in
consequence
of
a
little
accident
which
occurred
last
evening
to
my
own
residence
i
am
ad
interim
until
the
county
build
it
up
for
me
again
staying
at
a
house
called
walmesley
lodge
where
i
shall
expect
you
with
all
the
impatience
of
one
soliciting
an
honour
and
hoping
that
it
will
be
conferred
upon
him
i
trust
that
any
little
difference
of
opinion
on
other
subjects
will
not
interfere
to
prevent
the
harmony
of
our
morning's
meal
together
believe
me
to
be
my
dear
sir
with
the
greatest
possible
consideration
your
very
obedient
humble
servant
francis
varney
the
admiral
gasped
again
and
looked
at
mr
chillingworth
and
then
at
the
note
and
then
at
mr
chillingworth
again
as
if
he
was
perfectly
bewildered
that's
about
the
coolest
piece
of
business
said
mr
chillingworth
that
ever
i
heard
of
hang
me
said
the
admiral
if
i
sha'n't
like
the
fellow
at
last
it
is
cool
and
i
like
it
because
it
is
cool
where's
my
hat
where's
my
stick
what
are
you
going
to
do
accept
his
invitation
to
be
sure
and
breakfast
with
him
and
my
learned
friend
as
he
calls
you
i
hope
you'll
come
likewise
i'll
take
the
fellow
at
his
word
by
fair
means
or
by
foul
i'll
know
what
he
wants
here
and
why
he
persecutes
this
family
for
whom
i
have
an
attachment
and
what
hand
he
has
in
the
disappearance
of
my
nephew
charles
holland
for
as
sure
as
there's
a
heaven
above
us
he's
at
the
bottom
of
that
affair
where
is
this
walmesley
lodge
just
in
the
neighbourhood
but--
come
on
then
come
on
but
really
admiral
you
don't
mean
to
say
you'll
breakfast
with--with--
a
vampyre
yes
i
would
and
will
and
mean
to
do
so
here
jack
you
needn't
go
to
mr
bannerworth's
yet
come
my
learned
friend
let's
take
time
by
the
forelock
the
interrupted
breakfast
at
sir
francis
varney's
illustration
notwithstanding
all
mr
chillingworth
could
say
to
the
contrary
the
admiral
really
meant
to
breakfast
with
sir
francis
varney
the
worthy
doctor
could
not
for
some
time
believe
but
that
the
admiral
must
be
joking
when
he
talked
in
such
a
strain
but
he
was
very
soon
convinced
to
the
contrary
by
the
latter
actually
walking
out
and
once
more
asking
him
mr
chillingworth
if
he
meant
to
go
with
him
or
not
this
was
conclusive
so
the
doctor
said--
well
admiral
this
appears
to
me
rather
a
mad
sort
of
freak
but
as
i
have
begun
the
adventure
with
you
i
will
conclude
it
with
you
that's
right
said
the
admiral
i'm
not
deceived
in
you
doctor
so
come
along
hang
these
vampyres
i
don't
know
how
to
tackle
them
myself
i
think
after
all
sir
francis
varney
is
more
in
your
line
than
line
is
in
mine
how
do
you
mean
why
couldn't
you
persuade
him
he's
ill
and
wants
some
physic
that
would
soon
settle
him
you
know
settle
him
said
mr
chillingworth
i
beg
to
say
that
if
i
did
give
him
any
physic
the
dose
would
be
much
to
his
advantage
but
however
my
opinion
is
that
this
invitation
to
breakfast
is
after
all
a
mere
piece
of
irony
and
that
when
we
get
to
walmesley
lodge
we
shall
not
see
anything
of
him
on
the
contrary
we
shall
probably
find
it's
a
hoax
i
certainly
shouldn't
like
that
but
still
it's
worth
the
trying
the
fellow
has
really
behaved
himself
in
such
an
extraordinary
manner
that
if
i
can
make
terms
with
him
i
will
and
there's
one
thing
you
know
doctor
that
i
think
we
may
say
we
have
discovered
and
what
may
that
be
is
it
not
to
make
too
sure
of
a
vampyre
even
when
you
have
him
by
the
leg
no
that
ain't
it
though
that's
a
very
good
thing
in
its
way
but
it
is
just
this
that
sir
francis
varney
whoever
he
is
and
whatever
he
is
is
after
bannerworth
hall
and
not
the
bannerworth
family
if
you
recollect
mr
chillingworth
in
our
conversation
i
have
always
insisted
upon
that
fact
you
have
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
completely
verified
by
the
proceedings
of
the
night
there
then
admiral
is
the
great
mystery--what
can
he
want
at
bannerworth
hall
that
makes
him
take
such
a
world
of
trouble
and
run
so
many
fearful
risks
in
trying
to
get
at
it
that
is
indeed
the
mystery
and
if
he
really
means
this
invitation
to
breakfast
i
shall
ask
him
plumply
and
tell
him
at
the
same
time
that
possibly
his
very
best
way
to
secure
his
object
will
be
to
be
candid
vampyre
as
he
is
but
really
admiral
you
do
not
still
cling
to
that
foolish
superstition
of
believing
that
sir
francis
varney
is
in
reality
a
vampyre
i
don't
know
and
i
can't
say
if
anybody
was
to
give
me
a
description
of
a
strange
sort
of
fish
that
i
had
never
seen
i
wouldn't
take
upon
myself
to
say
there
wasn't
such
a
thing
nor
would
you
doctor
if
you
had
really
seen
the
many
odd
ones
that
i
have
encountered
at
various
times
well
well
admiral
i'm
certainly
not
belonging
to
that
school
of
philosophy
which
declares
the
impossible
to
be
what
it
don't
understand
there
may
be
vampyres
and
there
may
be
apparitions
for
all
i
know
to
the
contrary
i
only
doubt
these
things
because
i
think
if
they
were
true
that
as
a
phenomena
of
nature
they
would
have
been
by
this
time
established
by
repeated
instances
without
the
possibility
of
doubt
or
cavil
well
there's
something
in
that
but
how
far
have
we
got
to
go
now
no
further
than
to
yon
enclosure
where
you
see
those
park-like
looking
gates
and
that
cedar-tree
stretching
its
dark-green
foliage
so
far
into
the
road
that
is
walmesley
lodge
whither
you
have
been
invited
and
you
my
learned
friend
recollect
that
you
were
invited
too
so
that
you
are
no
intruder
upon
the
hospitality
of
varney
the
vampyre
i
say
admiral
said
mr
chillingworth
when
they
reached
the
gates
you
know
it
is
not
quite
the
thing
to
call
a
man
a
vampyre
at
his
own
breakfast-table
so
just
oblige
me
by
promising
not
to
make
any
such
remark
to
sir
francis
a
likely
thing
said
the
admiral
he
knows
i
know
what
he
is
and
he
knows
i'm
a
plain
man
and
a
blunt
speaker
however
i'll
be
civil
to
him
and
more
than
that
i
can't
promise
i
must
wring
out
of
him
if
i
can
what
has
become
of
charles
holland
and
what
the
deuce
he
really
wants
himself
well
well
come
to
no
collision
with
him
while
we're
his
guests
not
if
i
can
help
it
the
doctor
rang
at
the
gate
bell
of
walmesley
lodge
and
was
in
a
few
moments
answered
by
a
woman
who
demanded
their
business
is
sir
francis
varney
here
said
the
doctor
oh
ah
yes
she
replied
you
see
his
house
was
burnt
down
for
something
or
other--i'm
sure
i
don't
know
what--by
some
people--i'm
sure
i
don't
know
who
so
as
the
lodge
was
to
let
we
have
took
him
in
till
he
can
suit
himself
ah
that's
it
is
it
said
the
admiral--tell
him
that
admiral
bell
and
dr
chillingworth
are
here
very
well
said
the
woman
you
may
walk
in
thank
ye
you're
vastly
obliging
ma'am
is
there
anything
going
on
in
the
breakfast
line
well
yes
i
am
getting
him
some
breakfast
but
he
didn't
say
as
he
expected
company
the
woman
opened
the
garden
gate
and
they
walked
up
a
trimly
laid
out
garden
to
the
lodge
which
was
a
cottage-like
structure
in
external
appearance
although
within
it
boasted
of
all
the
comforts
of
a
tolerably
extensive
house
she
left
them
in
a
small
room
leading
from
the
hall
and
was
absent
about
five
minutes
then
she
returned
and
merely
saying
that
sir
francis
varney
presented
his
compliments
and
desired
them
to
walk
up
stairs
she
preceded
them
up
a
handsome
flight
which
led
to
the
first
floor
of
the
lodge
up
to
this
moment
mr
chillingworth
had
expected
some
excuse
for
notwithstanding
all
he
had
heard
and
seen
of
sir
francis
varney
he
could
not
believe
that
any
amount
of
impudence
would
suffice
to
enable
him
to
receive
people
as
his
guests
with
whom
he
must
feel
that
he
was
at
such
positive
war
it
was
a
singular
circumstance
and
perhaps
the
only
thing
that
matched
the
cool
impertinence
of
the
invitation
was
the
acceptance
of
it
under
the
circumstances
by
the
admiral
sir
francis
varney
might
have
intended
it
as
a
jest
but
if
he
did
so
in
the
first
instance
it
was
evident
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
beaten
with
his
own
weapons
the
room
into
which
they
were
shown
was
a
longish
narrow
one
a
very
wide
door
gave
them
admission
to
it
at
the
end
nearest
the
staircase
and
at
its
other
extremity
there
was
a
similar
door
opening
into
some
other
apartments
of
the
house
sir
francis
varney
sat
with
his
back
towards
this
second
door
and
a
table
with
some
chairs
and
other
articles
of
furniture
were
so
arranged
before
him
that
while
they
seemed
but
to
be
carelessly
placed
in
the
position
they
occupied
they
really
formed
a
pretty
good
barrier
between
him
and
his
visitors
the
admiral
however
was
too
intent
upon
getting
a
sight
of
varney
to
notice
any
preparation
of
this
sort
and
he
advanced
quickly
into
the
room
and
there
indeed
was
the
much
dreaded
troublesome
persevering
and
singular
looking
being
who
had
caused
such
a
world
of
annoyance
to
the
family
of
the
bannerworths
as
well
as
disturbing
the
peace
of
the
whole
district
which
had
the
misfortune
to
have
him
as
an
inhabitant
if
anything
he
looked
thinner
taller
and
paler
than
usual
and
there
seemed
to
be
a
slight
nervousness
of
manner
about
him
as
he
slowly
inclined
his
head
towards
the
admiral
which
was
not
quite
intelligible
well
said
admiral
bell
you
invited
me
to
breakfast
and
my
learned
friend
here
we
are
no
two
human
beings
said
varney
could
be
more
welcome
to
my
hospitality
than
yourself
and
dr
chillingworth
i
pray
you
to
be
seated
what
a
pleasant
thing
it
is
after
the
toils
and
struggles
of
this
life
occasionally
to
sit
down
in
the
sweet
companionship
of
such
dear
friends
he
made
a
hideous
face
as
he
spoke
and
the
admiral
looked
as
if
he
were
half
inclined
to
quarrel
at
that
early
stage
of
the
proceedings
dear
friends
he
said
well
well--it's
no
use
squabbling
about
a
word
or
two
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
mr
varney
or
sir
francis
varney
or
whatever
your
d----d
name
is--
hold
my
dear
sir
said
varney--after
breakfast
if
you
please--after
breakfast
he
rang
a
hand-bell
as
he
spoke
and
the
woman
who
had
charge
of
the
house
brought
in
a
tray
tolerably
covered
with
the
materials
for
a
substantial
morning's
meal
she
placed
it
upon
the
table
and
certainly
the
various
articles
that
smoked
upon
it
did
great
credit
to
her
culinary
powers
deborah
said
sir
varney
in
a
mild
sort
of
tone
keep
on
continually
bringing
things
to
eat
until
this
old
brutal
sea
ruffian
has
satiated
his
disgusting
appetite
the
admiral
opened
his
eyes
an
enormous
width
and
looking
at
sir
francis
varney
he
placed
his
two
fists
upon
the
table
and
drew
a
long
breath
did
you
address
those
observations
to
me
he
said
at
length
you
blood-sucking
vagabond
eh
said
sir
francis
varney
looking
over
the
admiral's
head
as
if
he
saw
something
interesting
on
the
wall
beyond
my
dear
admiral
said
mr
chillingworth
come
away
i'll
see
you
d----d
first
said
the
admiral
now
mr
vampyre
no
shuffling
did
you
address
those
observations
to
me
deborah
said
sir
francis
varney
in
silvery
tones
you
can
remove
this
tray
and
bring
on
the
next
not
if
i
know
it
said
the
admiral
i
came
to
breakfast
and
i'll
have
it
after
breakfast
i'll
pull
your
nose--ay
if
you
were
fifty
vampyres
i'd
do
it
dr
chillingworth
said
varney
without
paying
the
least
attention
to
what
the
admiral
said
you
don't
eat
my
dear
sir
you
must
be
fatigued
with
your
night's
exertions
a
man
of
your
age
you
know
cannot
be
supposed
to
roll
and
tumble
about
like
a
fool
in
a
pantomime
with
impunity
only
think
what
a
calamity
it
would
be
if
you
were
laid
up
your
patients
would
all
get
well
you
know
sir
francis
varney
said
mr
chillingworth
we're
your
guests
we
come
here
at
your
invitation
to
partake
of
a
meal
you
have
wantonly
attacked
both
of
us
i
need
not
say
that
by
so
doing
you
cast
a
far
greater
slur
upon
your
own
taste
and
judgment
than
you
can
upon
us
admirably
spoken
said
sir
francis
varney
giving
his
hands
a
clap
together
that
made
the
admiral
jump
again
now
old
bell
i'll
fight
you
if
you
think
yourself
aggrieved
while
the
doctor
sees
fair
play
old
who
shouted
the
admiral
bell
bell--is
not
your
name
bell--a
family
cognomen
i
presume
on
account
of
the
infernal
clack
clack
without
any
sense
in
it
that
is
the
characteristic
of
your
race
you'll
fight
me
said
the
admiral
jumping
up
yes
if
you
challenge
me
by
jove
i
do
of
course
then
i
accept
it
and
the
challenged
party
you
know
well
or
ought
to
know
can
make
his
own
terms
in
the
encounter
make
what
terms
you
please
i
care
not
what
they
are
only
say
you
will
fight
and
that's
sufficient
it
is
well
said
sir
francis
varney
in
a
solemn
tone
nay
nay
interrupted
mr
chillingworth
this
is
boyish
folly
hold
your
row
said
the
admiral
and
let's
hear
what
he's
got
to
say
in
this
mansion
said
sir
francis
varney--for
a
mansion
it
is
although
under
the
unpretending
name
of
a
lodge--in
this
mansion
there
is
a
large
apartment
which
was
originally
fitted
up
by
a
scientific
proprietor
of
the
place
for
the
purpose
of
microscopic
and
other
experiments
which
required
a
darkness
total
and
complete
such
a
darkness
as
seems
as
if
it
could
be
felt--palpable
thick
and
obscure
as
the
darkness
of
the
tomb
and
i
know
what
that
is
the
devil
you
do
said
this
admiral
it's
damp
too
ain't
it
the
room
no
the
grave
oh
uncommonly
after
autumnal
rains
but
to
resume--this
room
is
large
lofty
and
perfectly
empty
well
i
propose
that
we
procure
two
scythes
two
what
scythes
with
their
long
handles
and
their
convenient
holding
places
well
i'll
be
hanged
what
next
do
you
propose
you
may
be
hanged
the
next
is
that
with
these
scythes
we
be
both
of
us
placed
in
the
darkened
room
and
the
door
closed
and
doubly
locked
upon
us
for
one
hour
and
that
then
and
there
we
do
our
best
each
to
cut
the
other
in
two
if
you
succeed
in
dismembering
me
you
will
have
won
the
day
but
i
hope
from
my
superior
agility--here
sir
francis
jumped
upon
his
chair
and
sat
upon
the
back
of
it--to
get
the
better
of
you
how
do
you
like
the
plan
i
have
proposed
does
it
meet
your
wishes
curse
your
impudence
said
the
admiral
placing
his
elbows
upon
the
table
and
resting
his
chin
in
astonishment
upon
his
two
hands
nay
interrupted
sir
francis
you
challenged
me
and
besides
you'll
have
an
equal
chance
you
know
that
if
you
succeed
in
striking
me
first
down
i
go
whereas
it
i
succeed
in
striking
you
first
down
you
go
as
he
spoke
sir
francis
varney
stretched
out
his
foot
and
closed
a
small
bracket
which
held
out
the
flap
of
the
table
on
which
the
admiral
was
leaning
and
accordingly
down
the
admiral
went
tea-tray
and
all
mr
chillingworth
ran
to
help
him
up
and
when
they
both
recovered
their
feet
they
found
they
were
alone
the
mysterious
stranger--the
particulars
of
the
suicide
at
bannerworth
hall
illustration
hilloa
where
the
deuce
is
he
said
the
admiral
was
there
ever
such
a
confounded
take-in
well
i
really
don't
know
said
mr
chillingworth
but
it
seems
to
me
that
he
must
have
gone
out
of
that
door
that
was
behind
him
i
begin
do
you
know
admiral
to
wish--
what
that
we
had
never
come
here
at
all
and
i
think
the
sooner
we
get
out
of
it
the
better
yes
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
hoaxed
and
humbugged
in
this
way
i
will
have
satisfaction
but
not
with
those
confounded
scythes
and
things
he
talks
about
in
the
dark
room
give
me
broad
daylight
and
no
favour
yardarm
and
yardarm
broadside
and
broadside
hand-grenades
and
marling-spikes
well
but
that's
what
he
won't
do
now
admiral
listen
to
me
well
go
on
what
next
come
away
at
once
oh
you
said
that
before
yes
but
i'm
going
to
say
something
else
look
round
you
don't
you
think
this
a
large
scientific-looking
room
what
of
that
why
what
if
suppose
it
was
to
become
as
dark
as
the
grave
and
varney
was
to
enter
with
his
scythe
that
he
talks
of
and
begin
mowing
about
our
legs
the
devil
come
along
the
door
at
which
they
entered
was
at
this
moment
opened
and
the
old
woman
made
her
appearance
please
sir
she
said
here's
a
mr
mortimer
in
a
loud
voice
oh
sir
francis
ain't
here
where's
he
gone
gentlemen
to
the
devil
said
the
admiral
who
may
mr
mortimer
be
there
walked
past
the
woman
a
stout
portly-looking
man
well
dressed
but
with
a
very
odd
look
upon
his
face
in
consequence
of
an
obliquity
of
vision
which
prevented
the
possibility
of
knowing
which
way
he
was
looking
i
must
see
him
he
said
i
must
see
him
mr
chillingworth
started
back
as
if
in
amazement
good
god
he
cried
you
here
confusion
said
mortimer
are
you
dr----
dr----
the
same
hush
there
is
no
occasion
to
betray--that
is
to
state
my
secret
and
mine
too
said
chillingworth
but
what
brings
you
here
i
cannot
and
dare
not
tell
you
farewell
he
turned
abruptly
and
was
leaving
the
room
but
he
ran
against
some
one
at
the
entrance
and
in
another
moment
henry
bannerworth
heated
and
almost
breathless
by
evident
haste
made
his
appearance
hilloa
bravo
cried
the
admiral
the
more
the
merrier
here's
a
combined
squadron
why
how
came
you
here
mr
henry
bannerworth
bannerworth
said
mortimer
is
that
young
man's
name
bannerworth
yes
said
henry
do
you
know
me
sir
no
no
only
i--i--must
be
off
does
anybody
know
anything
of
sir
francis
varney
we
did
know
something
of
him
said
the
admiral
a
little
while
ago
but
he's
taken
himself
off
don't
you
do
so
likewise
if
you've
got
anything
to
say
stop
and
say
it
like
an
englishman
stuff
stuff
said
mortimer
impatiently
what
do
you
all
want
here
why
sir
francis
varney
said
henry--and
i
care
not
if
the
whole
world
heard
it--is
the
persecutor
of
my
family
how
in
what
way
he
has
the
reputation
of
a
vampyre
he
has
hunted
me
and
mine
from
house
and
home
indeed
yes
cried
dr
chillingworth
and
by
some
means
or
another
he
seems
determined
to
get
possession
of
bannerworth
hall
well
gentlemen
said
mortimer
i
promise
you
that
i
will
inquire
into
this
mr
chillingworth
i
did
not
expect
to
meet
you
perhaps
the
least
we
say
to
each
other
is
after
all
the
better
let
me
ask
but
one
question
said
dr
chillingworth
imploringly
ask
it
did
he
live
after--
hush
he
did
you
always
told
me
to
the
contrary
yes
i
had
an
object
the
game
is
up
farewell
and
gentlemen
as
i
am
making
my
exit
let
me
do
so
with
a
sentiment--society
at
large
is
divided
into
two
great
classes
and
what
may
they
be
said
the
admiral
those
who
have
been
hanged
and
those
who
have
not
adieu
he
turned
and
left
the
room
and
mr
chillingworth
sunk
into
a
chair
and
said
in
a
low
voice--
it's
uncommonly
true
and
i've
found
out
an
acquaintance
among
the
former
-d--n
it
you
seem
all
mad
said
the
admiral
i
can't
make
out
what
you
are
about
how
came
you
here
mr
henry
bannerworth
by
mere
accident
i
heard
said
henry
that
you
were
keeping
watch
and
ward
in
the
hall
admiral
it
was
cruel
and
not
well
done
of
you
to
attempt
such
an
enterprise
without
acquainting
me
with
it
did
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
i
who
had
the
greatest
interest
in
this
affair
would
have
shrunk
from
danger
if
danger
there
be
or
lacked
perseverance
if
that
quality
were
necessary
in
carrying
out
any
plan
by
which
the
safety
and
honour
of
my
family
might
be
preserved
nay
now
my
young
friend
said
mr
chillingworth
nay
sir
but
i
take
it
ill
that
i
should
have
been
kept
out
of
this
affair
and
it
should
have
been
sedulously
as
it
were
kept
a
secret
from
me
let
him
go
on
as
he
likes
said
the
admiral
boys
will
be
boys
after
all
you
know
doctor
it's
my
affair
and
not
yours
let
him
say
what
he
likes
where's
the
odds
it's
of
no
consequence
i
do
not
expect
admiral
bell
said
henry
that
it
is
to
you
but
it
is
to
me
psha
respecting
you
sir
as
i
do--
gammon
i
must
confess
that
i
did
expect--
what
you
didn't
get
therefore
there's
an
end
of
that
now
i
tell
you
what
henry
sir
francis
varney
is
within
this
house
at
least
i
have
reason
to
suppose
so
then
exclaimed
henry
impetuously
i
will
wring
from
him
answers
to
various
questions
which
concern
my
peace
and
happiness
please
gentlemen
said
the
woman
deborah
making
her
appearance
sir
francis
varney
has
gone
out
and
he
says
i'm
to
show
you
all
the
door
as
soon
as
it
is
convenient
for
you
all
to
walk
out
of
it
i
feel
convinced
said
mr
chillingworth
that
it
will
be
a
useless
search
now
to
attempt
to
find
sir
francis
varney
here
let
me
beg
of
you
all
to
come
away
and
believe
me
that
i
do
not
speak
lightly
or
with
a
view
to
get
you
from
here
when
i
say
that
after
i
have
heard
something
from
you
henry
which
i
shall
ask
you
to
relate
to
me
painful
though
it
may
be
i
shall
be
able
to
suggest
some
explanation
of
many
things
which
appear
at
present
obscure
and
to
put
you
in
a
course
of
freeing
you
from
the
difficulties
which
surround
you
which
heaven
knows
i
little
expected
i
should
have
it
in
my
power
to
propose
to
any
of
you
i
will
follow
your
advice
mr
chillingworth
said
henry
for
i
have
always
found
that
it
has
been
dictated
by
good
feeling
as
well
as
correct
judgment
admiral
bell
you
will
oblige
me
much
by
coming
away
with
me
now
and
at
once
well
remarked
the
admiral
if
the
doctor
has
really
something
to
say
it
alters
the
appearance
of
things
and
of
course
i
have
no
objection
upon
this
the
whole
three
of
them
immediately
left
the
place
and
it
was
evident
that
mr
chillingworth
had
something
of
an
uncomfortable
character
upon
his
mind
he
was
unusually
silent
and
reserved
and
when
he
did
speak
he
seemed
rather
inclined
to
turn
the
conversation
upon
indifferent
topics
than
to
add
anything
more
to
what
he
had
said
upon
the
deeply
interesting
one
which
held
so
foremost
a
place
in
all
their
minds
how
is
flora
now
he
asked
of
henry
since
her
removal
anxious
still
said
henry
but
i
think
better
that
is
well
i
perceive
that
naturally
we
are
all
three
walking
towards
bannerworth
hall
and
perhaps
it
is
as
well
that
on
that
spot
i
should
ask
of
you
henry
to
indulge
me
with
a
confidence
such
as
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
should
not
at
all
feel
myself
justified
in
requiring
of
you
to
what
does
it
relate
said
henry
you
may
be
assured
mr
chillingworth
that
i
am
not
likely
to
refuse
my
confidence
to
you
whom
i
have
so
much
reason
to
respect
as
an
attached
friend
of
myself
and
my
family
you
will
not
object
likewise
i
hope
added
mr
chillingworth
to
extend
that
confidence
to
admiral
bell
for
as
you
well
know
a
truer
and
more
warm-hearted
man
than
he
does
not
exist
what
do
you
expect
for
that
doctor
said
the
admiral
there
is
nothing
said
henry
that
i
could
relate
at
all
that
i
should
shrink
from
relating
to
admiral
bell
well
my
boy
said
the
admiral
and
all
i
can
reply
to
that
is
you
are
quite
right
for
there
can
be
nothing
that
you
need
shrink
from
telling
me
so
far
as
regards
the
fact
of
trusting
me
with
it
goes
i
am
assured
of
that
a
british
officer
once
pledging
his
word
prefers
death
to
breaking
it
whatever
you
wish
kept
secret
in
the
communication
you
make
to
me
say
so
and
it
will
never
pass
my
lips
why
sir
the
fact
is
said
henry
that
what
i
am
about
to
relate
to
you
consists
not
so
much
of
secrets
as
of
matters
which
would
be
painful
to
my
feelings
to
talk
of
more
than
may
be
absolutely
required
i
understand
you
let
me
for
a
moment
said
mr
chillingworth
put
myself
right
i
do
not
suspect
mr
henry
bannerworth
that
you
fancy
i
ask
you
to
make
a
recital
of
circumstances
which
must
be
painful
to
you
from
any
idle
motive
but
let
me
declare
that
i
have
now
a
stronger
impulse
which
induces
me
to
wish
to
hear
from
your
own
lips
those
matters
which
popular
rumour
may
have
greatly
exaggerated
or
vitiated
it
is
scarcely
possible
remarked
henry
sadly
that
popular
rumour
should
exaggerate
the
facts
indeed
no
they
are
unhappily
of
themselves
in
their
bare
truthfulness
so
full
of
all
that
can
be
grievous
to
those
who
are
in
any
way
connected
with
them
that
there
needs
no
exaggeration
to
invest
them
with
more
terror
or
with
more
of
that
sadness
which
must
ever
belong
to
a
recollection
of
them
in
my
mind
in
suchlike
discourse
as
this
the
time
was
passed
until
henry
bannerworth
and
his
friends
once
more
reached
the
hall
from
which
he
with
his
family
had
so
recently
removed
in
consequence
of
the
fearful
persecution
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
they
passed
again
into
the
garden
which
they
all
knew
so
well
and
then
henry
paused
and
looked
around
him
with
a
deep
sigh
in
answer
to
an
inquiring
glance
from
mr
chillingworth
he
said--
is
it
not
strange
now
that
i
should
have
only
been
away
from
here
a
space
of
time
which
may
be
counted
by
hours
and
yet
all
seems
changed
i
could
almost
fancy
that
years
had
elapsed
since
i
had
looked
at
it
oh
remarked
the
doctor
time
is
always
by
the
imagination
measured
by
the
number
of
events
which
are
crowded
into
a
given
space
of
it
and
not
by
its
actual
duration
come
into
the
house
there
you
will
find
all
just
as
you
left
it
henry
and
you
can
tell
us
your
story
at
leisure
the
air
said
henry
about
here
is
fresh
and
pleasant
let
us
sit
down
in
the
summer-house
yonder
and
there
i
will
tell
you
all
it
has
a
local
interest
too
connected
with
the
tale
this
was
agreed
to
and
in
a
few
moments
the
admiral
mr
chillingworth
and
henry
were
seated
in
the
same
summer-house
which
had
witnessed
the
strange
interview
between
sir
francis
varney
and
flora
bannerworth
in
which
he
had
induced
her
to
believe
that
he
felt
for
the
distress
he
had
occasioned
her
and
was
strongly
impressed
with
the
injustice
of
her
sufferings
henry
was
silent
for
some
few
moments
and
then
he
said
with
a
deep
sigh
as
he
looked
mournfully
around
him--
illustration
it
was
on
this
spot
that
my
father
breathed
his
last
and
hence
have
i
said
that
it
has
a
local
interest
in
the
tale
i
have
to
tell
which
makes
it
the
most
fitting
place
in
which
to
tell
it
oh
said
the
admiral
he
died
here
did
he
yes
where
you
are
now
sitting
very
good
i
have
seen
many
a
brave
man
die
in
my
time
and
i
hope
to
see
a
few
more
although
i
grant
you
the
death
in
the
heat
of
conflict
and
fighting
for
our
country
is
a
vastly
different
thing
to
some
shore-going
mode
of
leaving
the
world
yes
said
henry
as
if
pursuing
his
own
meditations
rather
than
listening
to
the
admiral
yes
it
was
from
this
precise
spot
that
my
father
took
his
last
look
at
the
ancient
house
of
his
race
what
we
can
now
see
of
it
he
saw
of
it
with
his
dying
eyes
and
many
a
time
i
have
sat
here
and
fancied
the
world
of
terrible
thoughts
that
must
at
such
a
moment
have
come
across
his
brain
you
might
well
do
so
said
the
doctor
you
see
added
henry
that
from
here
the
fullest
view
you
have
of
any
of
the
windows
of
the
house
is
of
that
of
flora's
room
as
we
have
always
called
it
because
for
years
she
had
had
it
as
her
chamber
and
when
all
the
vegetation
of
summer
is
in
its
prime
and
the
vine
which
you
perceive
crawls
over
this
summer-house
is
full
of
leaf
and
fruit
the
view
is
so
much
hindered
that
it
is
difficult
without
making
an
artificial
gap
in
the
clustering
foliage
to
see
anything
but
the
window
so
i
should
imagine
replied
mr
chillingworth
you
doctor
added
henry
who
know
much
of
my
family
need
not
be
told
what
sort
of
man
my
father
was
no
indeed
but
you
admiral
bell
who
do
not
know
must
be
told
and
however
grievous
it
may
be
to
me
to
have
to
say
so
i
must
inform
you
that
he
was
not
a
man
who
would
have
merited
your
esteem
well
said
the
admiral
you
know
my
boy
that
can
make
no
difference
as
regards
you
in
anybody's
mind
who
has
got
the
brains
of
an
owl
every
man's
credit
character
and
honour
to
my
thinking
is
in
his
own
most
special
keeping
and
let
your
father
be
what
he
might
or
who
he
might
i
do
not
see
that
any
conduct
of
his
ought
to
raise
upon
your
cheek
the
flush
of
shame
or
cost
you
more
uneasiness
than
ordinary
good
feeling
dictates
to
the
errors
and
feelings
of
a
fellow
creature
if
all
the
world
said
henry
would
take
such
liberal
and
comprehensive
views
as
you
do
admiral
it
would
be
much
happier
than
it
is
but
such
is
not
the
case
and
people
are
but
too
apt
to
blame
one
person
for
the
evil
that
another
has
done
ah
but
said
mr
chillingworth
it
so
happens
that
those
are
the
people
whose
opinions
are
of
the
very
least
consequence
there
is
some
truth
in
that
said
henry
sadly
but
however
let
me
proceed
since
i
have
to
tell
the
tale
i
could
wish
it
over
my
father
then
admiral
bell
although
a
man
not
tainted
in
early
life
with
vices
became
by
the
force
of
bad
associates
and
a
sort
of
want
of
congeniality
and
sentiment
that
sprang
up
between
him
and
my
mother
plunged
into
all
the
excesses
of
his
age
these
excesses
were
all
of
that
character
which
the
most
readily
lay
hold
strongly
of
an
unreflecting
mind
because
they
all
presented
themselves
in
the
garb
of
sociality
the
wine
cup
is
drained
in
the
name
of
good
fellowship
money
which
is
wanted
for
legitimate
purposes
is
squandered
under
the
mask
of
a
noble
and
free
generosity
and
all
that
the
small
imaginations
of
a
number
of
persons
of
perverted
intellects
could
enable
them
to
do
has
been
done
from
time
to
time
to
impart
a
kind
of
lustre
to
intemperance
and
all
its
dreadful
and
criminal
consequences
my
father
having
once
got
into
the
company
of
what
he
considered
wits
and
men
of
spirit
soon
became
thoroughly
vitiated
he
was
almost
the
only
one
of
the
set
among
whom
he
passed
what
he
considered
his
highly
convivial
existence
who
was
really
worth
anything
pecuniarily
speaking
there
were
some
among
them
who
might
have
been
respectable
men
and
perchance
carved
their
way
to
fortune
as
well
as
some
others
who
had
started
in
life
with
good
patrimonies
but
he
my
father
at
the
time
he
became
associated
with
them
was
the
only
one
as
i
say
who
to
use
a
phrase
i
have
heard
myself
from
his
lips
concerning
them
had
got
a
feather
to
fly
with
the
consequence
of
this
was
that
his
society
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
animal
gratification
of
drinking
at
his
expense
was
courted
and
he
was
much
flattered
all
of
which
he
laid
to
the
score
of
his
own
merits
which
had
been
found
out
and
duly
appreciated
by
these
bon
vivants
while
he
considered
that
the
grave
admonitions
of
his
real
friends
proceeded
from
nothing
in
the
world
but
downright
envy
and
malice
such
a
state
of
things
as
this
could
not
last
very
long
the
associates
of
my
father
wanted
money
as
well
as
wine
so
they
introduced
him
to
the
gaming-table
and
he
became
fascinated
with
the
fearful
vice
to
an
extent
which
predicted
his
own
destruction
and
the
ruin
of
every
one
who
was
in
any
way
dependent
upon
him
he
could
not
absolutely
sell
bannerworth
hall
unless
i
had
given
my
consent
which
i
refused
but
he
accumulated
debt
upon
debt
and
from
time
to
time
stripped
the
mansion
of
all
its
most
costly
contents
with
various
mutations
of
fortune
he
continued
this
horrible
and
baneful
career
for
a
long
time
until
at
last
he
found
himself
utterly
and
irretrievably
ruined
and
he
came
home
in
an
agony
of
despair
being
so
weak
and
utterly
ruined
in
constitution
that
he
kept
his
bed
for
many
days
it
appeared
however
that
something
occurred
at
this
juncture
which
gave
him
actually
or
all
events
awakened
a
hope
that
he
should
possess
some
money
and
be
again
in
a
position
to
try
his
fortune
at
the
gaming-table
he
rose
and
fortifying
himself
once
more
with
the
strong
stimulant
of
wine
and
spirits
he
left
his
home
and
was
absent
for
about
two
months
what
occurred
to
him
during
that
time
we
none
of
us
ever
knew
but
late
one
night
he
came
home
apparently
much
flurried
in
manner
and
seeming
as
if
something
had
happened
to
drive
him
half
mad
he
would
not
speak
to
any
one
but
he
shut
himself
up
the
whole
of
the
night
in
the
chamber
where
hangs
the
portrait
that
bears
so
strong
a
resemblance
to
sir
francis
varney
and
there
he
remained
till
the
morning
when
he
emerged
and
said
briefly
that
he
intended
to
leave
the
country
he
was
in
a
most
fearful
state
of
nervousness
and
my
mother
tells
me
that
he
shook
like
one
in
an
ague
and
started
at
every
little
sound
that
occurred
in
the
house
and
glared
about
him
so
wildly
that
it
was
horrible
to
see
him
or
to
sit
in
the
same
apartment
with
him
she
says
that
the
whole
morning
passed
on
in
this
way
till
a
letter
came
to
him
the
contents
of
which
appeared
to
throw
him
into
a
perfect
convulsion
of
terror
and
he
retired
again
to
the
room
with
the
portrait
where
he
remained
some
hours
and
then
he
emerged
looking
like
a
ghost
so
dreadfully
pale
and
haggard
was
he
he
walked
into
the
garden
here
and
was
seen
to
sit
down
in
this
summer-house
and
fix
his
eyes
upon
the
window
of
that
apartment
henry
paused
for
a
few
moments
and
then
he
added--
you
will
excuse
me
from
entering
upon
any
details
of
what
next
ensued
in
the
melancholy
history
my
father
here
committed
suicide
he
was
found
dying
and
all
i
he
words
he
spoke
were
'the
money
is
hidden'
death
claimed
his
victim
and
with
a
convulsive
spasm
he
resigned
his
spirit
leaving
what
he
had
intended
to
say
hidden
in
the
oblivion
of
the
grave
that
was
an
odd
affair
said
the
admiral
it
was
indeed
we
have
all
pondered
deeply
and
the
result
was
that
upon
the
whole
we
were
inclined
to
come
to
an
opinion
that
the
words
he
so
uttered
were
but
the
result
of
the
mental
disturbance
that
at
such
a
moment
might
well
be
supposed
to
be
ensuing
in
the
mind
and
that
they
related
really
to
no
foregone
fact
any
more
than
some
incoherent
words
uttered
by
a
man
in
a
dream
might
be
supposed
to
do
it
may
be
so
i
do
not
mean
remarked
mr
chillingworth
for
one
moment
to
attempt
to
dispute
henry
the
rationality
of
such
an
opinion
as
you
have
just
given
utterance
to
but
you
forget
that
another
circumstance
occurred
which
gave
a
colour
to
the
words
used
by
your
father
yes
i
know
to
what
you
allude
be
so
good
as
to
state
it
to
the
admiral
i
will
on
the
evening
of
that
same
day
there
came
a
man
here
who
in
seeming
ignorance
of
what
had
occurred
although
by
that
time
it
was
well
known
to
all
the
neighbourhood
asked
to
see
my
father
upon
being
told
that
he
was
dead
he
started
back
either
with
well
acted
or
with
real
surprise
and
seemed
to
be
immensely
chagrined
he
then
demanded
to
know
if
he
had
left
any
disposition
of
his
property
but
he
got
no
information
and
departed
muttering
the
most
diabolical
oaths
and
curses
that
can
be
imagined
he
mounted
his
horse
for
he
had
ridden
to
the
hall
and
his
last
words
were
as
i
am
told--
'where
in
the
name
of
all
that's
damnable
can
he
have
put
the
money'
and
did
you
never
find
out
who
this
man
was
asked
the
admiral
never
it
is
an
odd
affair
it
is
said
mr
chillingworth
and
full
of
mystery
the
public
mind
was
much
taken
up
at
the
time
with
some
other
matters
or
it
would
have
made
the
death
of
mr
bannerworth
the
subject
of
more
prolific
comment
than
it
did
as
it
was
however
a
great
deal
was
said
upon
the
subject
and
the
whole
comity
was
in
a
state
of
commotion
for
weeks
afterwards
yes
said
henry
it
so
happened
that
about
that
very
time
a
murder
was
committed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
which
baffled
all
the
exertions
of
the
authorities
to
discover
the
perpetrators
of
it
was
the
murder
of
lord
lorne
oh
i
remember
said
the
admiral
the
newspapers
were
full
of
it
for
a
long
time
they
were
and
so
as
mr
chillingworth
says
the
more
exciting
interest
which
that
affair
created
drew
off
public
attention
in
a
great
measure
from
my
father's
suicide
and
we
did
not
suffer
so
much
from
public
remark
and
from
impertinent
curiosity
as
might
have
been
expected
and
in
addition
said
mr
chillingworth
and
he
changed
colour
a
little
as
he
spoke
there
was
an
execution
shortly
afterwards
yes
said
henry
there
was
the
execution
of
a
man
named
angerstein
added
mr
chillingworth
for
a
highway
robbery
attended
with
the
most
brutal
violence
true
all
the
affairs
of
that
period
of
time
are
strongly
impressed
upon
my
mind
said
henry
but
you
do
not
seem
well
mr
chillingworth
oh
yes
i
am
quite
well--you
are
mistaken
both
the
admiral
and
henry
looked
scrutinizingly
at
the
doctor
who
certainly
appeared
to
them
to
be
labouring
under
some
great
mental
excitement
which
he
found
it
almost
beyond
his
power
to
repress
i
tell
you
what
it
is
doctor
said
the
admiral
i
don't
pretend
and
never
did
to
see
further
through
a
tar-barrel
than
my
neighbours
but
i
can
see
far
enough
to
feel
convinced
that
you
have
got
something
on
your
mind
and
that
it
somehow
concerns
this
affair
is
it
so
said
henry
i
cannot
if
i
would
said
mr
chillingworth
and
i
may
with
truth
add
that
i
would
not
if
i
could
hide
from
you
that
i
have
something
on
my
mind
connected
with
this
affair
but
let
me
assure
you
it
would
be
premature
of
me
to
tell
you
of
it
premature
be
d----d
said
the
admiral
out
with
it
nay
nay
dear
sir
i
am
not
now
in
a
position
to
say
what
is
passing
through
my
mind
alter
your
position
then
and
be
blowed
cried
jack
pringle
suddenly
stepping
forward
and
giving
the
doctor
such
a
push
that
he
nearly
went
through
one
of
the
sides
of
the
summer-house
why
you
scoundrel
cried
the
admiral
how
came
you
here
on
my
legs
said
jack
do
you
think
nobody
wants
to
know
nothing
but
yourself
i'm
as
fond
of
a
yarn
as
anybody
but
if
you
are
said
mr
chillingworth
you
had
no
occasion
to
come
against
me
as
if
you
wanted
to
move
a
house
you
said
as
you
wasn't
in
a
position
to
say
something
as
i
wanted
to
hear
so
i
thought
i'd
alter
it
for
you
is
this
fellow
said
the
doctor
shaking
his
head
as
he
accosted
the
admiral
the
most
artful
or
stupid
a
little
of
both
said
admiral
bell--a
little
of
both
doctor
he's
a
great
fool
and
a
great
scamp
the
same
to
you
said
jack
you're
another
i
shall
hate
you
presently
if
you
go
on
making
yourself
so
ridiculous
now
mind
i'll
only
give
you
a
trial
of
another
week
or
so
and
if
you
don't
be
more
purlite
in
your
d--n
language
i'll
leave
you
away
strolled
jack
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
towards
the
house
while
the
admiral
was
half
choked
with
rage
and
could
only
glare
after
him
without
the
ability
to
say
a
word
under
any
other
circumstances
than
the
present
one
of
trouble
and
difficulty
and
deep
anxiety
henry
bannerworth
must
have
laughed
at
these
singular
little
episodes
between
jack
and
the
admiral
but
his
mind
was
now
by
far
too
much
harassed
to
permit
him
to
do
so
let
him
go
let
him
go
my
dear
sir
said
mr
chillingworth
to
the
admiral
who
showed
some
signs
of
an
intention
to
pursue
jack
he
no
doubt
has
been
drinking
again
i'll
turn
him
off
the
first
moment
i
catch
him
sober
enough
to
understand
me
said
the
admiral
well
well
do
as
you
please
but
now
let
me
ask
a
favour
of
both
of
you
what
is
it
that
you
will
leave
bannerworth
hall
to
me
for
a
week
what
for
i
hope
to
make
some
discoveries
connected
with
it
which
shall
well
reward
you
for
the
trouble
it's
no
trouble
said
henry
and
for
myself
i
have
amply
sufficient
faith
both
in
your
judgment
and
in
your
friendship
doctor
to
accede
to
any
request
which
you
may
make
to
me
and
i
said
the
admiral
be
it
so--be
it
so
for
one
week
you
say
yes--for
one
week
i
hope
by
the
end
of
that
time
to
have
achieved
something
worth
the
telling
you
of
and
i
promise
you
that
if
i
am
at
all
disappointed
in
my
expectation
that
i
will
frankly
and
freely
communicate
to
you
all
i
know
and
all
i
suspect
then
that's
a
bargain
it
is
and
what's
to
be
done
at
once
why
nothing
but
to
take
the
greatest
possible
care
that
bannerworth
hall
is
not
left
another
hour
without
some
one
in
it
and
in
order
that
such
should
be
the
case
i
have
to
request
that
you
two
will
remain
here
until
i
go
to
the
town
and
make
preparations
for
taking
quiet
possession
of
it
myself
which
i
will
do
in
the
course
of
two
hours
at
most
don't
be
longer
said
the
admiral
for
i
am
so
desperately
hungry
that
i
shall
certainly
begin
to
eat
somebody
if
you
are
depend
upon
me
very
well
said
henry
you
may
depend
we
will
wait
here
until
you
come
back
the
doctor
at
once
hurried
from
the
garden
leaving
henry
and
the
admiral
to
amuse
themselves
as
best
they
might
with
conjectures
as
to
what
he
was
really
about
until
his
return
the
mysterious
meeting
in
the
ruin
again--the
vampyre's
attack
upon
the
constable
illustration
it
is
now
necessary
that
we
return
once
more
to
that
mysterious
ruin
in
the
intricacies
of
which
varney
when
pursued
by
the
mob
had
succeeded
in
finding
a
refuge
which
defied
all
the
exertions
which
were
made
for
his
discovery
our
readers
must
be
well
aware
that
connected
with
that
ruin
are
some
secrets
of
great
importance
to
our
story
and
we
will
now
at
the
solemn
hour
of
midnight
take
another
glance
at
what
is
doing
within
its
recesses
at
that
solemn
hour
it
is
not
probable
that
any
one
would
seek
that
gloomy
place
from
choice
some
lover
of
the
picturesque
certainly
might
visit
it
but
such
was
not
the
inciting
cause
of
the
pilgrimage
with
those
who
were
soon
to
stand
within
its
gloomy
precincts
other
motives
dictated
their
presence
in
that
spot--motives
of
rapine
peradventure
of
murder
itself
as
the
neighbouring
clocks
sounded
the
hour
of
twelve
and
the
faint
strokes
were
borne
gently
on
the
wind
to
that
isolated
ruin
there
might
have
been
seen
a
tall
man
standing
by
the
porch
of
what
had
once
been
a
large
doorway
to
some
portion
of
the
ruin
his
form
was
enveloped
in
a
large
cloak
which
was
of
such
ample
material
that
he
seemed
well
able
to
wrap
it
several
times
around
him
and
then
leave
a
considerable
portion
of
it
floating
idly
in
the
gentle
wind
he
stood
as
still
as
calm
and
as
motionless
as
a
statue
for
a
considerable
time
before
any
degree
of
impatience
began
to
show
itself
then
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
large
antique
watch
the
white
face
of
which
just
enabled
him
to
see
what
the
time
was
and
in
a
voice
which
had
in
it
some
amount
of
petulance
and
anger
he
said--
not
come
yet
and
nearly
half
an
hour
beyond
the
time
what
can
have
detained
him
this
is
indeed
trifling
with
the
most
important
moments
of
a
man's
existence
even
as
he
spoke
he
heard
from
some
distance
off
the
sound
of
a
short
quick
footstep
he
bent
forwards
to
listen
and
then
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
he
said--
he
comes--he
comes
but
he
who
thus
waited
for
some
confederate
among
these
dim
and
old
grey
ruins
advanced
not
a
step
to
meet
him
on
the
contrary
such
seemed
the
amount
of
cold-blooded
caution
which
he
possessed
that
the
nearer
the
man--who
was
evidently
advancing--got
to
the
place
the
further
back
did
he
who
had
preceded
him
shrink
into
the
shadow
of
the
dim
and
crumbling
walls
which
had
for
some
years
now
past
seemed
to
bend
to
the
passing
blast
and
to
be
on
the
point
of
yielding
to
the
destroying
hand
of
time
and
yet
surely
he
needed
not
have
been
so
cautious
who
was
likely
at
such
an
hour
as
that
to
come
to
the
ruins
but
one
who
sought
it
by
appointment
and
moreover
the
manner
of
the
advancing
man
should
have
been
quite
sufficient
to
convince
him
who
waited
that
so
much
caution
was
unnecessary
but
it
was
a
part
and
parcel
of
his
nature
about
three
minutes
more
sufficed
to
bring
the
second
man
to
the
ruin
and
he
at
once
and
fearlessly
plunged
into
its
recesses
who
comes
said
the
first
man
in
a
deep
hollow
voice
he
whom
you
expect
was
the
reply
good
he
said
and
at
once
he
now
emerged
from
his
hiding-place
and
they
stood
together
in
the
nearly
total
darkness
with
which
the
place
was
enshrouded
for
the
night
was
a
cloudy
one
and
there
appeared
not
a
star
in
the
heavens
to
shed
its
faint
light
upon
the
scene
below
for
a
few
moments
they
were
both
silent
for
he
who
had
last
arrived
had
evidently
made
great
exertions
to
reach
the
spot
and
was
breathing
laboriously
while
he
who
was
there
first
appeared
from
some
natural
taciturnity
of
character
to
decline
opening
the
conversation
at
length
the
second
comer
spoke
saying--
i
have
made
some
exertion
to
get
here
to
my
time
and
yet
i
am
beyond
it
as
you
are
no
doubt
aware
yes
yes
well
such
would
not
have
been
the
case
but
yet
i
stayed
to
bring
you
some
news
of
importance
indeed
it
is
so
this
place
which
we
have
now
for
some
time
had
as
a
quiet
and
perfectly
eligible
one
of
meeting
is
about
to
be
invaded
by
one
of
those
restless
troublesome
spirits
who
are
never
happy
but
when
they
are
contriving
something
to
the
annoyance
of
others
who
do
not
interfere
with
them
explain
yourself
more
fully
i
will
at
a
tavern
in
the
town
there
has
happened
some
strange
scenes
of
violence
in
consequence
of
the
general
excitement
into
which
the
common
people
have
been
thrown
upon
the
dreadful
subject
of
vampyres
well
the
consequence
is
that
numerous
arrests
have
taken
place
and
the
places
of
confinement
for
offenders
against
the
laws
are
now
full
of
those
whose
heated
and
angry
imaginations
have
induced
them
to
take
violent
steps
to
discover
the
reality
or
the
falsehood
of
rumours
which
so
much
affected
them
their
wives
and
their
families
that
they
feared
to
lie
down
to
their
night's
repose
the
other
laughed
a
short
hollow
restless
sort
of
laugh
which
had
not
one
particle
of
real
mirth
in
it
go
on--go
on
he
said
what
did
they
do
immense
excesses
have
been
committed
but
what
made
me
first
of
all
stay
beyond
my
time
was
that
i
overheard
a
man
declare
his
intentions
this
night
from
twelve
till
the
morning
and
for
some
nights
to
come
to
hold
watch
and
ward
for
the
vampyre
indeed
yes
he
did
but
stay
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
his
comrades
to
take
yet
another
glass
ere
he
came
upon
his
expedition
he
must
be
met
the
idiot
what
business
is
it
of
his
there
are
always
people
who
will
make
everything
their
business
whether
it
be
so
or
not
there
are
let
us
retire
further
into
the
recesses
of
the
ruin
and
there
consider
as
well
what
is
to
be
done
regarding
more
important
affairs
as
with
this
rash
intruder
here
they
both
walked
for
some
twenty
paces
or
so
right
into
the
ruin
and
then
he
who
had
been
there
first
said
suddenly
to
his
companion--
i
am
annoyed
although
the
feeling
reaches
no
further
than
annoyance
for
i
have
a
natural
love
of
mischief
to
think
that
my
reputation
has
spread
so
widely
and
made
so
much
noise
your
reputation
as
a
vampyre
sir
francis
varney
you
mean
yes
but
there
is
no
occasion
for
you
to
utter
my
name
aloud
even
here
where
we
are
alone
together
it
came
out
unawares
unawares
can
it
be
possible
that
you
have
so
little
command
over
yourself
as
to
allow
a
name
to
come
from
your
lips
unawares
sometimes
i
am
surprised
well
it
cannot
be
helped
what
do
you
now
propose
to
do
nay
you
are
my
privy
councillor
have
you
no
deep-laid
artful
project
in
hand
can
you
not
plan
and
arrange
something
which
may
yet
have
the
effect
of
accomplishing
what
at
first
seemed
so
very
simple
but
which
has
from
one
unfortunate
circumstance
and
another
become
full
of
difficulty
and
pregnant
with
all
sorts
of
dangers
i
must
confess
i
have
no
plan
i
listen
with
astonishment
nay
now
you
are
jesting
when
did
you
ever
hear
of
me
jesting
not
often
i
admit
but
you
have
a
fertile
genius
and
i
have
always
myself
found
it
easier
to
be
the
executive
than
to
plan
an
elaborate
course
of
action
for
others
then
you
throw
it
all
on
me
i
throw
a
weight
naturally
enough
upon
the
shoulders
which
i
think
the
best
adapted
to
sustain
it
be
it
so
then--be
it
so
you
are
i
presume
from
what
you
say
provided
with
a
scheme
of
action
which
shall
present
better
hopes
of
success
at
less
risk
i
hope
look
what
great
danger
we
have
already
passed
through
yes
we
have
i
pray
you
avoid
that
in
the
next
campaign
it
is
not
the
danger
that
annoys
and
troubles
me
but
it
is
that
notwithstanding
it
the
object
is
as
far
off
as
ever
from
being
attained
and
not
only
so
but
as
is
invariably
the
case
under
such
circumstances
we
have
made
it
more
difficult
of
execution
because
we
have
put
those
upon
their
guard
thoroughly
who
are
the
most
likely
to
oppose
us
we
have--we
have
and
placed
the
probability
of
success
afar
off
indeed
and
yet
i
have
set
my
life
upon
the
cast
and
i
will
stand
the
hazard
i
tell
you
i
will
accomplish
this
object
or
i
will
perish
in
the
attempt
you
are
too
enthusiastic
not
at
all
nothing
has
been
ever
done
the
execution
of
which
was
difficult
without
enthusiasm
i
will
do
what
i
intend
or
bannerworth
hall
shall
become
a
heap
of
ruins
where
fire
shall
do
its
worst
work
of
devastation
and
i
will
myself
find
a
grave
in
the
midst
well
i
quarrel
with
no
man
for
chalking
out
the
course
he
intends
to
pursue
but
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
the
prisoner
below
here
kill
him
what
i
say
kill
him
do
you
not
understand
me
i
do
indeed
when
everything
else
is
secured
and
when
the
whole
of
that
which
i
so
much
court
and
which
i
will
have
is
in
my
possession
i
will
take
his
life
or
you
shall
ay
you
are
just
the
man
for
such
a
deed
a
smooth-faced
specious
sort
of
roan
are
you
and
you
like
not
danger
there
will
be
none
in
taking
the
life
of
a
man
who
is
chained
to
the
floor
of
a
dungeon
i
know
not
why
said
the
other
you
take
a
pleasure
on
this
particular
night
of
all
others
in
saying
all
you
can
which
you
think
will
be
offensive
to
me
now
how
you
wrong
me
this
is
the
reward
of
confidence
i
don't
want
such
confidence
why
you
surely
don't
want
me
to
flatter
you
no
but--
psha
hark
you
that
admiral
is
the
great
stumbling-block
in
my
way
i
should
ere
this
have
had
undisturbed
possession
of
bannerworth
hall
but
for
him
he
must
be
got
out
of
the
way
somehow
a
short
time
will
tire
him
out
of
watching
he
is
one
of
those
men
of
impulse
who
soon
become
wearied
of
inaction
ay
and
then
the
bannerworths
return
to
the
hall
it
may
be
so
i
am
certain
of
it
we
have
been
out-generalled
in
this
matter
although
i
grant
we
did
all
that
men
could
do
to
give
us
success
in
what
way
would
you
get
rid
of
this
troublesome
admiral
i
scarcely
know
a
letter
from
his
nephew
might
if
well
put
together
get
him
to
london
i
doubt
it
i
hate
him
mortally
he
has
offended
me
more
than
once
most
grievously
i
know
it
he
saw
through
you
i
do
not
give
him
so
much
credit
he
is
a
suspicious
man
and
a
vain
and
a
jealous
one
and
yet
he
saw
through
you
now
listen
to
me
you
are
completely
at
fault
and
have
no
plan
of
operations
whatever
in
your
mind
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
disappear
from
the
neighbourhood
for
a
time
and
so
will
i
as
for
our
prisoner
here
below
i
cannot
see
what
else
can
be
done
with
him
than--than--
than
what
do
you
hesitate
i
do
then
what
is
it
you
were
about
to
say
i
cannot
but
feel
that
all
we
have
done
hitherto
as
regards
this
young
prisoner
of
ours
has
failed
he
has
with
a
determined
obstinacy
set
at
naught
as
well
you
know
all
threats
he
has
he
has
refused
to
do
one
act
which
could
in
any
way
aid
me
in
my
objects
in
fact
from
the
first
to
the
last
he
has
been
nothing
but
an
expense
and
an
encumbrance
to
us
both
all
that
is
strictly
true
and
yet
although
you
as
well
as
i
know
of
a
marvellously
ready
way
of
getting
rid
of
such
encumbrances
i
must
own
that
i
shrink
with
more
than
a
feeling
of
reluctance
from
the
murder
of
the
youth
you
contemplated
it
then
asked
the
other
no
i
cannot
be
said
to
have
contemplated
it
that
is
not
the
proper
sort
of
expression
to
use
what
is
then
to
contemplate
a
deed
seems
to
me
to
have
some
close
connexion
to
the
wish
to
do
it
and
you
have
no
such
wish
i
have
no
such
wish
and
what
is
more
i
will
not
do
it
then
that
is
sufficient
and
the
only
question
that
remains
for
you
to
confide
is
what
you
will
do
it
is
far
easier
in
all
enterprises
to
decide
upon
what
we
will
not
do
than
upon
what
we
will
for
my
own
part
i
must
say
that
i
can
perceive
no
mode
of
extricating
ourselves
from
this
involvement
with
anything
like
safety
then
it
must
be
done
with
something
like
danger
as
you
please
you
say
so
and
your
words
bear
a
clear
enough
signification
but
from
your
tone
i
can
guess
how
much
you
are
dissatisfied
with
the
aspect
of
affairs
dissatisfied
yes
i
say
dissatisfied
be
frank
and
own
that
which
it
is
in
vain
to
conceal
from
me
i
know
you
too
well
arch
hypocrite
as
you
are
and
fully
capable
of
easily
deceiving
many
you
cannot
deceive
me
i
really
cannot
understand
you
then
i
will
take
care
that
you
shall
how
listen
i
will
not
have
the
life
of
charles
holland
taken
who
wishes
to
take
it
you
there
indeed
you
wrong
me
unless
you
yourself
thought
that
such
an
act
was
imperatively
called
for
by
the
state
of
affairs
do
you
think
that
i
would
needlessly
bring
down
upon
my
head
the
odium
as
well
as
the
danger
of
such
a
deed
no
no
let
him
live
if
you
are
willing
he
may
live
a
thousand
years
for
all
i
care
'tis
well
i
am
mark
me
not
only
willing
but
i
am
determined
that
he
shall
live
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
i
can
respect
the
courage
that
even
when
he
considered
that
his
life
was
at
stake
enabled
him
to
say
no
to
a
proposal
which
was
cowardly
and
dishonourable
although
it
went
far
to
the
defeat
of
my
own
plans
and
has
involved
me
in
much
trouble
hush
hush
what
is
it
i
fancy
i
hear
a
footstep
indeed
that
were
a
novelty
in
such
a
place
as
this
and
yet
not
more
than
i
expected
have
you
forgotten
what
i
told
you
when
i
reached
here
to-night
after
the
appointed
hour
truly
i
had
for
the
moment
do
you
think
then
that
the
footstep
which
now
meets
our
ears
is
that
of
the
adventurer
who
boasted
that
he
could
keep
watch
for
the
vampyre
in
faith
do
i
what
is
to
be
done
with
such
a
meddling
fool
he
ought
certainly
to
be
taught
not
to
be
so
fond
of
interfering
with
other
people's
affairs
certainly
perchance
the
lesson
will
not
be
wholly
thrown
away
upon
others
it
may
be
worth
while
to
take
some
trouble
with
this
poor
valiant
fellow
and
let
him
spread
his
news
so
as
to
stop
any
one
else
from
being
equally
venturous
and
troublesome
a
good
thought
shall
it
be
done
yes
if
you
will
arrange
that
which
shall
accomplish
such
a
result
be
it
so
the
moon
rises
soon
it
does
ah
already
i
fancy
i
see
a
brightening
of
the
air
as
if
the
mellow
radiance
of
the
queen
of
night
were
already
quietly
diffusing
itself
throughout
the
realms
of
space
come
further
within
the
ruins
they
both
walked
further
among
the
crumbling
walls
and
fragments
of
columns
with
which
the
place
abounded
as
they
did
so
they
paused
now
and
then
to
listen
and
more
than
once
they
both
heard
plainly
the
sound
of
certain
footsteps
immediately
outside
the
once
handsome
and
spacious
building
varney
the
vampyre
who
had
been
holding
this
conversation
with
no
other
than
marchdale
smiled
as
he
in
a
whispered
voice
told
the
latter
what
to
do
in
order
to
frighten
away
from
the
place
the
foolhardy
man
who
thought
that
by
himself
he
should
be
able
to
accomplish
anything
against
the
vampyre
it
was
indeed
a
hair-brained
expedition
for
whether
sir
francis
varney
was
really
so
awful
and
preternatural
a
being
as
so
many
concurrent
circumstances
would
seem
to
proclaim
or
not
he
was
not
a
likely
being
to
allow
himself
to
be
conquered
by
anyone
individual
let
his
powers
or
his
courage
be
what
they
might
what
induced
this
man
to
become
so
ventursome
we
shall
now
proceed
to
relate
as
well
as
what
kind
of
reception
he
got
in
the
old
ruins
which
since
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
sir
francis
varney
within
their
recesses
had
possessed
so
increased
a
share
of
interest
and
attracted
so
much
popular
attention
and
speculation
the
guests
at
the
inn
and
the
story
of
the
dead
uncle
illustration
as
had
been
truly
stated
by
mr
marchdale
who
now
stands
out
in
his
true
colours
to
the
reader
as
the
confidant
and
abettor
of
sir
francis
varney
there
had
assembled
on
that
evening
a
curious
and
a
gossipping
party
at
the
inn
where
such
dreadful
and
such
riotous
proceedings
had
taken
place
which
in
their
proper
place
we
have
already
duly
and
at
length
recorded
it
was
not
very
likely
that
on
that
evening
or
for
many
and
many
an
evening
to
come
the
conversation
in
the
parlour
of
the
inn
would
be
upon
any
other
subject
than
that
of
the
vampyre
indeed
the
strange
mysterious
and
horrible
circumstances
which
had
occurred
bade
fair
to
be
gossipping
stock
in
trade
for
many
a
year
never
before
had
a
subject
presenting
so
many
curious
features
arisen
never
within
the
memory
of
that
personage
who
is
supposed
to
know
everything
had
there
occurred
any
circumstance
in
the
county
or
set
of
circumstances
which
afforded
such
abundant
scope
for
conjecture
and
speculation
everybody
might
have
his
individual
opinion
and
be
just
as
likely
to
be
right
as
his
neighbours
and
the
beauty
of
the
affair
was
that
such
was
the
interest
of
the
subject
itself
that
there
was
sure
to
be
a
kind
of
reflected
interest
with
every
surmise
that
at
all
bore
upon
it
illustration
on
this
particular
night
when
marchdale
was
prowling
about
gathering
what
news
he
could
in
order
that
he
might
carry
it
to
the
vampyre
a
more
than
usually
strong
muster
of
the
gossips
of
the
town
took
place
indeed
all
of
any
note
in
the
talking
way
were
there
with
the
exception
of
one
and
he
was
in
the
county
gaol
being
one
of
the
prisoners
apprehended
by
the
military
when
they
made
the
successful
attack
upon
the
lumber-room
of
the
inn
after
the
dreadful
desecration
of
the
dead
which
had
taken
place
the
landlord
of
the
inn
was
likely
to
make
a
good
thing
of
it
for
talking
makes
people
thirsty
and
he
began
to
consider
that
a
vampyre
about
once
a-year
would
be
no
bad
thing
for
the
blue
lion
it's
shocking
said
one
of
the
guests
it's
shocking
to
think
of
only
last
night
i
am
quite
sure
i
had
such
a
fright
that
it
added
at
least
ten
years
to
my
age
a
fright
said
several
i
believe
i
speak
english--i
said
a
fright
well
but
had
it
anything
to
do
with
the
vampyre
everything
oh
do
tell
us
do
tell
us
all
about
it
how
was
it
did
he
come
to
you
go
on
well
well
the
first
speaker
became
immediately
a
very
important
personage
in
the
room
and
when
he
saw
that
he
became
at
once
a
very
important
personage
in
his
own
eyes
likewise
and
before
he
would
speak
another
word
he
filled
a
fresh
pipe
and
ordered
another
mug
of
ale
it's
no
use
trying
to
hurry
him
said
one
no
he
said
it
isn't
i'll
tell
you
in
good
time
what
a
dreadful
circumstance
has
made
me
sixty-three
to-day
when
i
was
only
fifty-three
yesterday
was
it
very
dreadful
rather
you
wouldn't
have
survived
it
at
all
indeed
no
now
listen
i
went
to
bed
at
a
quarter
after
eleven
as
usual
i
didn't
notice
anything
particular
in
the
room
did
you
peep
under
the
bed
no
i
didn't
well
as
i
was
a-saying
to
bed
i
went
and
i
didn't
fasten
the
door
because
being
a
very
sound
sleeper
in
case
there
was
a
fire
i
shouldn't
hear
a
word
of
it
if
i
did
no
said
another
i
recollect
once--
be
so
good
as
allow
me
to
finish
what
i
know
before
you
begin
to
recollect
anything
if
you
please
as
i
was
saying
i
didn't
lock
the
door
but
i
went
to
bed
somehow
or
another
i
did
not
feel
at
all
comfortable
and
i
tossed
about
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
but
it
was
all
in
vain
i
only
got
every
moment
more
and
more
fidgetty
and
did
you
think
of
the
vampyre
said
one
of
the
listeners
i
thought
of
nothing
else
till
i
heard
my
clock
which
is
on
the
landing
of
the
stairs
above
my
bed-room
begin
to
strike
twelve
ah
i
like
to
hear
a
clock
sound
in
the
night
said
one
it
puts
one
in
mind
of
the
rest
of
the
world
and
lets
one
know
one
isn't
all
alone
very
good
the
striking
of
the
clock
i
should
not
at
all
have
objected
to
but
it
was
what
followed
that
did
the
business
what
what
fair
and
softly
fair
and
softly
just
hand
me
a
light
mr
sprigs
if
you
please
i'll
tell
you
all
gentlemen
in
a
moment
or
two
with
the
most
provoking
deliberation
the
speaker
re-lit
his
pipe
which
had
gone
out
while
he
was
talking
and
then
after
a
few
whiffs
to
assure
himself
that
its
contents
had
thoroughly
ignited
he
resumed--
no
sooner
had
the
last
sound
of
it
died
away
than
i
heard
something
on
the
stairs
yes
yes
it
was
as
if
some
man
had
given
his
foot
a
hard
blow
against
one
of
the
stairs
and
he
would
have
needed
to
have
had
a
heavy
boot
on
to
do
it
i
started
up
in
bed
and
listened
as
you
may
well
suppose
not
in
the
most
tranquil
state
of
mind
and
then
i
heard
an
odd
gnawing
sort
of
noise
and
then
another
dab
upon
one
of
the
stairs
how
dreadful
it
was
what
to
do
i
knew
not
or
what
to
think
except
that
the
vampyre
had
by
some
means
got
in
at
the
attic
window
and
was
coming
down
stairs
to
my
room
that
seemed
the
most
likely
then
there
was
another
groan
and
then
another
heavy
step
and
as
they
were
evidently
coming
towards
my
door
i
felt
accordingly
and
got
out
of
bed
not
knowing
hardly
whether
i
was
on
my
head
or
my
heels
to
try
and
lock
my
door
ah
to
be
sure
yes
that
was
all
very
well
if
i
could
have
done
it
but
a
man
in
such
a
state
of
mind
as
i
was
in
is
not
a
very
sharp
hand
at
doing
anything
i
shook
from
head
to
foot
the
room
was
very
dark
and
i
couldn't
for
a
moment
or
two
collect
my
senses
sufficient
really
to
know
which
way
the
door
lay
what
a
situation
it
was
dab
dab
dab
came
these
horrid
footsteps
and
there
was
i
groping
about
the
room
in
an
agony
i
heard
them
coming
nearer
and
nearer
to
my
door
another
moment
and
they
must
have
reached
it
when
my
hand
struck
against
the
lock
what
an
escape
no
it
was
not
no
no
indeed
the
key
was
on
the
outside
and
you
may
well
guess
i
was
not
over
and
above
disposed
to
open
the
door
to
get
at
it
no
no
i
felt
regularly
bewildered
i
can
tell
you
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
very
devil
himself
was
coming
down
stairs
hopping
all
the
way
upon
one
leg
how
terrific
i
felt
my
senses
almost
leaving
me
but
i
did
what
i
could
to
hold
the
door
shut
just
as
i
heard
the
strange
step
come
from
the
last
stair
on
to
the
landing
then
there
was
a
horrid
sound
and
some
one
began
trying
the
lock
of
my
door
what
a
moment
yes
i
can
tell
you
it
was
a
moment
such
a
moment
as
i
don't
wish
to
go
through
again
i
held
the
door
as
close
as
i
could
and
did
not
speak
i
tried
to
cry
out
help
and
murder
but
i
could
not
my
tongue
stuck
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
my
strength
was
fast
failing
me
horrid
horrid
take
a
drop
of
ale
thank
you
well
i
don't
think
this
went
on
above
two
or
three
minutes
and
all
the
while
some
one
tried
might
and
main
to
push
open
the
door
my
strength
left
me
all
at
once
i
had
only
time
to
stagger
back
a
step
or
two
and
then
as
the
door
opened
i
fainted
away
well
well
ah
you
wouldn't
have
said
well
if
you
had
been
there
i
can
tell
you
no
but
what
become
of
you
what
happened
next
how
did
it
end
what
was
it
why
what
exactly
happened
next
after
i
fainted
i
cannot
tell
you
but
the
first
thing
i
saw
when
i
recovered
was
a
candle
yes
yes
and
then
a
crowd
of
people
ah
ah
and
then
dr
web
gracious
and
mrs
bulk
my
housekeeper
i
was
in
my
own
bed
and
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
heard
dr
webb
say--
'he
will
be
better
soon
can
no
one
form
any
idea
of
what
it
is
all
about
some
sudden
fright
surely
could
alone
have
produced
such
an
effect'
'the
lord
have
mercy
upon
me'
said
i
upon
this
everybody
who
had
been
called
in
got
round
the
bed
and
wanted
to
know
what
had
happened
but
i
said
not
a
word
of
it
but
turning
to
mrs
bulk
i
asked
her
how
it
was
she
found
out
i
had
fainted
'why
sir'
says
she
'i
was
coming
up
to
bed
as
softly
as
i
could
because
i
knew
you
had
gone
to
rest
some
time
before
the
clock
was
striking
twelve
and
as
i
went
past
it
some
of
my
clothes
i
suppose
caught
the
large
weight
but
it
was
knocked
off
and
down
the
stairs
it
rolled
going
with
such
a
lump
from
one
to
the
other
and
i
couldn't
catch
it
because
it
rolled
so
fast
that
i
made
sure
you
would
be
awakened
so
i
came
down
to
tell
you
what
it
was
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
get
your
room
door
open
and
when
i
did
i
found
you
out
of
bed
and
insensible'
there
was
a
general
look
of
disappointment
when
this
explanation
was
given
and
one
said--
then
it
was
not
the
vampire
certainly
not
and
after
all
only
a
clock
weight
that's
about
it
why
didn't
you
tell
us
that
at
first
because
that
would
have
spoilt
the
story
there
was
a
general
murmur
of
discontent
and
after
a
few
moments
one
man
said
with
some
vivacity--
well
although
our
friend's
vampyre
has
turned
out
after
all
to
be
nothing
but
a
confounded
clock-weight
there's
no
disputing
the
fact
about
sir
francis
varney
being
a
vampyre
and
not
a
clock-weight
very
true--very
true
and
what's
to
be
done
to
rid
the
town
of
such
a
man
oh
don't
call
him
a
man
well
a
monster
ah
that's
more
like
i
tell
you
what
sir
if
you
had
got
a
light
when
you
first
heard
the
noise
in
your
room
and
gone
out
to
see
what
it
was
you
would
have
spared
yourself
much
fright
ah
no
doubt
it's
always
easy
afterwards
to
say
if
you
had
done
this
and
if
you
had
done
the
other
so
and
so
would
have
been
the
effect
but
there
is
something
about
the
hour
of
midnight
that
makes
men
tremble
well
said
one
who
had
not
yet
spoken
i
don't
see
why
twelve
at
night
should
be
a
whit
more
disagreeable
than
twelve
at
day
don't
you
not
i
now
for
instance
many
a
party
of
pleasure
goes
to
that
old
ruin
where
sir
francis
varney
so
unaccountably
disappeared
in
broad
daylight
but
is
there
any
one
here
who
would
go
to
it
alone
and
at
midnight
yes
who
i
would
what
and
after
what
has
happened
as
regards
the
vampyre
in
connection
with
it
yes
i
would
i'll
bet
you
twenty
shilling
you
won't
and
i--and
i
cried
several
well
gentlemen
said
the
man
who
certainly
shewed
no
signs
of
fear
i
will
go
and
not
only
will
i
go
and
take
all
your
bets
but
if
i
do
meet
the
vampyre
then
i'll
do
my
best
to
take
him
prisoner
and
when
will
you
go
to-night
he
cried
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
hark
ye
all
i
don't
believe
one
word
about
vampyres
i'll
go
at
once
it's
getting
late
and
let
any
one
of
you
in
order
that
you
may
be
convinced
i
have
been
to
the
place
give
me
any
article
which
i
will
hide
among
the
ruins
and
tell
you
where
to
find
it
to-morrow
in
broad
daylight
well
said
one
that's
fair
tom
eccles
here's
a
handkerchief
of
mine
i
should
know
it
again
among
a
hundred
others
agreed
i'll
leave
it
in
the
ruins
the
wagers
were
fairly
agreed
upon
several
handkerchiefs
were
handed
to
tom
eccles
and
at
eleven
o'clock
he
fairly
started
through
the
murky
darkness
of
the
night
to
the
old
ruin
where
sir
francis
varney
and
marchdale
were
holding
their
most
unholy
conference
it
is
one
thing
to
talk
and
to
accept
wagers
in
the
snug
parlour
of
an
inn
and
another
to
go
alone
across
a
tract
of
country
wrapped
in
the
profound
stillness
of
night
to
an
ancient
ruin
which
in
addition
to
the
natural
gloom
which
might
well
be
supposed
to
surround
it
has
superadded
associations
which
are
anything
but
of
a
pleasant
character
tom
eccles
as
he
was
named
was
one
of
those
individuals
who
act
greatly
from
impulse
he
was
certainly
not
a
coward
and
perhaps
really
as
free
from
superstition
as
most
persons
but
he
was
human
and
consequently
he
had
nerves
and
he
had
likewise
an
imagination
he
went
to
his
house
first
before
he
started
on
his
errand
to
the
ruins
it
was
to
get
a
horse-pistol
which
he
had
and
which
he
duly
loaded
and
placed
in
his
pocket
then
he
wrapped
himself
up
in
a
great-coat
and
with
the
air
of
a
man
quite
determined
upon
something
desperate
he
left
the
town
the
guests
at
the
inn
looked
after
him
as
he
walked
from
the
door
of
that
friendly
establishment
and
some
of
them
as
they
saw
his
resolved
aspect
began
to
quake
for
the
amount
of
the
wagers
they
had
laid
upon
his
non-success
however
it
was
resolved
among
them
that
they
would
stay
until
half-past
twelve
in
the
expectation
of
his
return
before
they
separated
to
while
away
the
time
he
who
had
been
so
facetious
about
his
story
of
the
clock-weight
volunteered
to
tell
what
happened
to
a
friend
of
his
who
went
to
take
possession
of
some
family
property
which
he
became
possessed
of
as
heir-at-law
to
an
uncle
who
had
died
without
a
will
having
an
illegitimate
family
unprovided
for
in
every
shape
ah
nobody
cares
for
other
people's
illegitimate
children
and
if
their
parents
don't
provide
for
them
why
the
workhouse
is
open
for
them
just
as
if
they
were
something
different
from
other
people
so
they
are
if
their
parents
don't
take
care
of
them
and
provide
for
them
nobody
else
will
as
you
say
neighbour
except
when
they
have
a
fitz
put
to
their
name
which
tells
you
they
are
royal
bastards
and
of
course
unlike
anybody
else's
but
go
on--let's
know
all
about
it
we
sha'n't
hear
what
he
has
got
to
say
at
all
at
this
rate
well
as
i
was
saying
or
about
to
say
the
nephew
as
soon
as
he
heard
his
uncle
was
dead
comes
and
claps
his
seal
upon
everything
in
the
house
but
could
he
do
so
inquired
one
of
the
guests
i
don't
see
what
was
to
hinder
him
replied
a
third
he
could
do
so
certainly
but
there
was
a
son
and
as
i
take
it
a
son's
nearer
than
a
nephew
any
day
but
the
son
is
illegitimate
legitimate
or
illegitimate
a
son's
a
son
don't
bother
me
about
distinction
of
that
sort
why
now
there
was
old
weatherbit--
order
order
let's
hear
the
tale
very
good
gentlemen
i'll
go
on
if
i
ain't
to
be
interrupted
but
i'll
say
this
that
an
illegitimate
son
is
no
son
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
or
at
most
he's
an
accident
quite
and
ain't
what
he
is
and
so
can't
inherit
well
that's
what
i
call
making
matters
plain
said
one
of
the
guests
who
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
to
make
room
for
the
remark
now
that
is
what
i
likes
well
as
i
have
proved
then
resumed
the
speaker
the
nephew
was
the
heir
and
into
the
house
he
would
come
a
fine
affair
it
was
too--the
illegitimates
looking
the
colour
of
sloes
but
he
knew
the
law
and
would
have
it
put
in
force
law's
law
you
know
uncommonly
true
that
and
the
nephew
stuck
to
it
like
a
cobbler
to
his
last--he
said
they
should
go
out
and
they
did
go
out
and
say
what
they
would
about
their
natural
claims
he
would
not
listen
to
them
but
bundled
them
out
and
out
in
a
pretty
short
space
of
time
it
was
trying
to
them
mind
you
to
leave
the
house
they
had
been
born
in
with
very
different
expectations
to
those
which
now
appeared
to
be
their
fate
poor
things
they
looked
ruefully
enough
and
well
they
might
for
there
was
a
wide
world
for
them
and
no
prospect
of
a
warm
corner
well
as
i
was
saying
he
had
them
all
out
and
the
house
clear
to
himself
now
said
he
i
have
an
open
field
and
no
favour
i
don't
care
for
no--eh
what
there
was
a
sudden
knocking
he
thought
the
door
and
went
and
opened
it
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
oh
i
see--somebody
next
door
and
if
it
wasn't
it
don't
matter
there's
nobody
here
i'm
alone
and
there's
plenty
of
valuables
in
the
house
that
is
what
i
call
very
good
company
i
wouldn't
wish
for
better
he
turned
about
looked
over
room
after
room
and
satisfied
himself
that
he
was
alone--that
the
house
was
empty
at
every
room
he
entered
he
paused
to
think
over
the
value--what
it
was
worth
and
that
he
was
a
very
fortunate
man
in
having
dropped
into
such
a
good
thing
ah
there's
the
old
boy's
secretary
too--his
bureau--there'll
be
something
in
that
that
will
amuse
me
mightily
but
i
don't
think
i
shall
sit
up
late
he
was
a
rum
old
man
to
say
the
least
of
it--a
very
odd
sort
of
man
with
that
he
gave
himself
a
shrug
as
if
some
very
uncomfortable
feeling
had
come
over
him
i'll
go
to
bed
early
and
get
some
sleep
and
then
in
daylight
i
can
look
after
these
papers
they
won't
be
less
interesting
in
the
morning
than
they
are
now
there
had
been
some
rum
stories
about
the
old
man
and
now
the
nephew
seemed
to
think
he
might
have
let
the
family
sleep
on
the
premises
for
that
night
yes
at
that
moment
he
could
have
found
it
in
his
heart
to
have
paid
for
all
the
expense
of
their
keep
had
it
been
possible
to
have
had
them
back
to
remain
the
night
but
that
wasn't
possible
for
they
would
not
have
done
it
but
sooner
have
remained
in
the
streets
all
night
than
stay
there
all
night
like
so
many
house-dogs
employed
by
one
who
stepped
in
between
them
and
their
father's
goods
which
were
their
inheritance
but
for
one
trifling
circumstance--a
mere
ceremony
the
night
came
on
and
he
had
lights
true
it
was
he
had
not
been
down
stairs
only
just
to
have
a
look
he
could
not
tell
what
sort
of
a
place
it
was
there
were
a
good
many
odd
sort
of
passages
that
seemed
to
end
nowhere
and
others
that
did
there
were
large
doors
but
they
were
all
locked
and
he
had
the
keys
so
he
didn't
mind
but
secured
all
places
that
were
not
fastened
he
then
went
up
stairs
again
and
sat
down
in
the
room
where
the
bureau
was
placed
i'll
be
bound
said
one
of
the
guests
he
was
in
a
bit
of
a
stew
notwithstanding
all
his
brag
oh
i
don't
believe
said
another
that
anything
done
that
is
dangerous
or
supposed
to
be
dangerous
by
the
bravest
man
is
any
way
wholly
without
some
uncomfortable
feelings
they
may
not
be
strong
enough
to
prevent
the
thing
proposed
to
be
done
from
being
done
but
they
give
a
disagreeable
sensation
to
the
skin
you
have
felt
it
then
ha
ha
ha
why
at
that
time
i
slept
in
the
churchyard
for
a
wager
i
must
say
i
felt
cold
all
over
as
if
my
skin
was
walking
about
me
in
an
uncomfortable
manner
but
you
won
your
wager
i
did
and
of
course
you
slept
there
to
be
sure
i
did
and
met
with
nothing
nothing
save
a
few
bumps
against
the
gravestones
those
were
hard
knocks
i
should
say
they
were
i
assure
you
but
i
lay
there
and
slept
there
and
won
my
wager
would
you
do
it
again
no
and
why
not
because
of
the
rheumatism
you
caught
that
i
did
i
would
give
ten
times
my
wager
to
get
rid
of
them
i
have
them
very
badly
come
order
order--the
tale
let's
hear
the
end
of
that
since
it
has
begun
with
all
my
heart
come
neighbour
well
as
i
said
he
was
fidgetty
but
yet
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
very
easily
frightened
or
overcome
for
he
was
stout
and
bold
when
he
shut
himself
up
in
the
room
he
took
out
a
bottle
of
some
good
wine
and
helped
himself
to
drink
it
was
good
old
wine
and
he
soon
felt
himself
warmed
and
comforted
he
could
have
faced
the
enemy
if
one
bottle
produces
such
an
effect
he
muttered
what
will
two
do
this
was
a
question
that
could
only
be
solved
by
trying
it
and
this
he
proceeded
to
do
but
first
he
drew
a
brace
of
long
barrelled
pistols
from
his
coat
pocket
and
taking
a
powder-flask
and
bullets
from
his
pocket
also
he
loaded
them
very
carefully
there
said
he
are
my
bull-dogs
and
rare
watch-dogs
they
are
they
never
bark
but
they
bite
now
if
anybody
does
come
it
will
be
all
up
with
them
tricks
upon
travellers
ain't
a
safe
game
when
i
have
these
and
now
for
the
other
bottle
he
drew
the
other
bottle
and
thought
if
anything
it
was
better
than
the
first
he
drank
it
rather
quick
to
be
sure
and
then
he
began
to
feel
sleepy
and
tired
i
think
i
shall
go
to
bed
he
said
that
is
if
i
can
find
my
way
there
for
it
does
seem
to
me
as
if
the
door
was
travelling
never
mind
it
will
make
a
call
here
again
presently
and
then
i'll
get
through
so
saying
he
arose
taking
the
candle
in
his
hand
he
walked
with
a
better
step
than
might
have
been
expected
under
the
circumstance
true
it
was
the
candle
wagged
to
and
fro
and
his
shadow
danced
upon
the
wall
but
still
when
he
got
to
the
bed
he
secured
his
door
put
the
light
in
a
safe
place
threw
himself
down
and
was
fast
asleep
in
a
few
moments
or
rather
he
fell
into
a
doze
instantaneously
how
long
he
remained
in
this
state
he
knew
not
but
he
was
suddenly
awakened
by
a
loud
bang
as
though
something
heavy
and
flat
had
fallen
upon
the
floor--such
for
instance
as
a
door
or
anything
of
that
sort
he
jumped
up
rubbed
his
eyes
and
could
even
then
hear
the
reverberations
through
the
house
what
is
that
he
muttered
what
is
that
he
listened
and
thought
he
could
hear
something
moving
down
stairs
and
for
a
moment
he
was
seized
with
an
ague
fit
but
recollecting
i
suppose
that
there
were
some
valuables
down
stairs
that
were
worth
fighting
for
he
carefully
extinguished
the
light
that
still
burned
and
softly
crept
down
stairs
when
he
got
down
stairs
he
thought
he
could
hear
some
one
scramble
up
the
kitchen
stairs
and
then
into
the
room
where
the
bureau
was
listening
for
a
moment
to
ascertain
if
there
were
more
than
one
and
then
feeling
convinced
there
was
not
he
followed
into
the
parlour
when
he
heard
the
cabinet
open
by
a
key
this
was
a
new
miracle
and
one
he
could
not
understand
and
then
he
heard
the
papers
begin
to
rattle
and
rustle
so
drawing
out
one
of
the
pistols
he
cocked
it
and
walked
in
the
figure
instantly
began
to
jump
about
it
was
dressed
in
white--in
grave-clothes
he
was
terribly
nervous
and
shook
so
he
feared
to
fire
the
pistol
but
at
length
he
did
and
the
report
was
followed
by
a
fall
and
a
loud
groan
this
was
very
dreadful--very
dreadful
but
all
was
quiet
and
he
lit
the
candle
again
and
approached
the
body
to
examine
it
and
ascertain
if
he
knew
who
it
was
a
groan
came
from
it
the
bureau
was
open
and
the
figure
clutched
firmly
a
will
in
his
hand
the
figure
was
dressed
in
grave-clothes
and
he
started
up
when
he
saw
the
form
and
features
of
his
own
uncle
the
man
who
was
dead
who
somehow
or
other
had
escaped
his
confinement
and
found
his
way
up
here
he
held
his
will
firmly
and
the
nephew
was
so
horrified
and
stunned
that
he
threw
down
the
light
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
with
a
shout
of
terror
and
never
returned
again





the
narrator
concluded
and
one
of
the
guests
said--
and
do
you
really
believe
it--no
no--to
be
sure
not
you
don't--why
should
i
my
friend
was
out
of
all
hand
one
of
the
greatest
liars
i
ever
came
near
and
why
therefore
should
i
believe
him
i
don't
on
my
conscience
believe
one
word
of
it
it
was
now
half-past
twelve
and
as
tom
eccles
came
not
back
and
the
landlord
did
not
feel
disposed
to
draw
any
more
liquor
they
left
the
inn
and
retired
to
their
separate
houses
in
a
great
state
of
anxiety
to
know
the
fate
of
their
respective
wagers
the
vampire
in
the
moonlight--the
false
friend
illustration
part
of
the
distance
being
accomplished
towards
the
old
ruins
tom
eccles
began
to
feel
that
what
he
had
undertaken
was
not
altogether
such
child's-play
as
he
had
at
first
imagined
it
to
be
somehow
or
another
with
a
singular
and
uncomfortable
sort
of
distinctness
there
came
across
his
mind
every
story
that
he
had
remembered
of
the
wild
and
the
wonderful
all
the
long-since
forgotten
tales
of
superstition
that
in
early
childhood
he
had
learned
came
now
back
upon
him
suggesting
to
his
mind
a
thousand
uncomfortable
fancies
of
the
strangest
description
it
was
not
likely
that
when
once
a
man
under
such
circumstances
got
into
such
a
frame
of
mind
he
would
readily
get
out
of
it
again
while
he
continued
surrounded
by
such
scenes
as
had
first
called
them
into
existence
no
doubt
had
he
turned
about
and
faced
the
inn
again
instead
of
the
old
ruins
he
would
soon
have
shaken
off
these
thick
coming
fancies
but
such
a
result
was
no
to
be
expected
so
long
as
he
kept
on
towards
the
dismal
place
he
had
pledged
himself
to
reach
as
he
traversed
meadow
after
meadow
he
began
to
ask
himself
some
questions
which
he
found
that
he
could
not
answer
exactly
in
a
consolatory
manner
under
the
present
state
of
things
among
these
question
was
the
very
pertinent
one
of--it's
no
argument
against
vampyres
because
i
don't
see
the
use
of
'em--is
it
this
he
was
compelled
to
answer
as
he
had
put
it
and
when
in
addition
he
began
to
recollect
that
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
sir
francis
varney
the
supposed
vampyre
had
been
chased
across
the
fields
to
that
very
ruin
whither
he
was
bound
and
had
then
and
there
disappeared
he
certainly
found
himself
in
decidedly
uncomfortable
and
most
unpromising
situation
no
he
said
no
hang
it
i
won't
go
back
now
to
be
made
the
laughing-stock
of
the
whole
town
which
i
should
be
come
what
may
of
it
i
will
go
on
as
i
have
commenced
so
i
shall
put
on
as
stout
a
heart
as
i
can
then
having
come
to
this
resolve
he
strove
might
and
main
to
banish
from
his
mind
those
disagreeable
reminiscences
that
had
been
oppressing
him
to
turn
his
attention
to
subjects
of
a
different
complexion
during
the
progress
of
making
this
endeavour
which
was
rather
futile
he
came
within
sight
of
the
ruins
then
he
slackened
his
pace
a
little
telling
himself
with
a
pardonable
self-deceit
that
it
was
common
ordinary
caution
only
which
induced
him
to
do
so
and
nothing
at
all
in
the
shape
of
fear
time
enough
he
remarked
to
be
afraid
when
i
see
anything
to
be
afraid
of
which
i
don't
see
as
yet
so
as
all's
right
i
may
as
well
put
a
good
face
upon
the
matter
he
tried
to
whistle
a
tune
but
it
turned
out
only
a
melancholy
failure
so
he
gave
that
up
in
despair
and
walked
on
until
he
got
within
a
hundred
yards
or
thereabouts
of
the
old
ruins
he
thus
proceeded
and
bending
his
ear
close
to
the
ground
he
listened
attentively
for
several
minutes
somehow
he
fancied
that
a
strange
murmuring
sound
came
to
his
ears
but
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
it
proceeded
from
the
ruins
because
it
was
just
that
sort
of
sound
that
might
come
from
a
long
way
off
being
mellowed
by
distance
although
perhaps
loud
enough
at
its
source
well
well
he
whispered
to
himself
it
don't
matter
much
after
all
go
i
must
and
hide
the
handkerchiefs
somewhere
or
else
be
laughed
at
besides
losing
my
wages
the
former
i
don't
like
and
the
latter
i
cannot
afford
thus
clinching
the
matter
by
such
knock-down
arguments
he
walked
on
until
he
was
almost
within
the
very
shadow
of
the
ruins
and
probably
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
his
footsteps
may
have
been
heard
by
marchdale
and
sir
francis
varney
then
he
paused
again
but
all
was
profoundly
still
and
he
began
to
think
that
the
strange
sort
of
murmuring
noise
which
he
had
heard
must
have
come
from
far
off
and
not
at
all
from
any
person
or
persons
within
the
ruins
let
me
see
he
said
to
himself
i
have
five
handkerchiefs
to
hide
among
the
old
ruins
somewhere
and
the
sooner
i
do
so
the
better
because
then
i
will
get
away
for
as
regards
staying
here
to
watch
heaven
knows
how
long
for
sir
francis
varney
i
don't
intend
to
do
it
upon
second
thoughts
and
second
thoughts
they
say
are
generally
best
with
the
most
careful
footsteps
now
as
if
he
were
treading
upon
some
fragile
substance
which
he
feared
to
injure
he
advanced
until
he
was
fairly
within
the
precincts
of
the
ancient
place
which
now
bore
so
ill
a
reputation
he
then
made
to
himself
much
the
same
remark
that
sir
francis
varney
had
made
to
marchdale
with
respect
to
the
brightening
up
of
the
sky
in
consequence
of
its
being
near
the
time
for
the
moon
to
rise
from
the
horizon
and
he
saw
more
clearly
around
him
although
he
could
not
find
any
good
place
to
hide
the
handkerchiefs
in
i
must
and
will
he
said
hide
them
securely
for
it
would
indeed
be
remarkably
unpleasant
after
coming
here
and
winning
my
wages
to
have
the
proofs
that
i
had
done
so
taken
away
by
some
chance
visitor
to
the
place
he
at
length
saw
a
tolerably
large
stone
which
stood
in
a
slant
position
up
against
one
of
the
walls
its
size
attracted
him
he
thought
if
his
strength
was
sufficient
to
move
it
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
do
so
and
to
place
the
handkerchiefs
beneath
it
for
at
all
events
it
was
so
heavy
that
it
could
not
be
kicked
aside
and
no
one
without
some
sort
of
motive
to
do
so
beyond
the
mere
love
of
labour
would
set
about
moving
it
from
its
position
i
may
go
further
and
fare
worse
he
said
to
himself
so
here
shall
all
the
handkerchiefs
lie
to
afford
a
proof
that
i
have
been
here
he
packed
them
into
a
small
compass
and
then
stooped
to
roll
aside
the
heavy
stone
when
at
the
moment
before
he
could
apply
his
strength
to
that
purpose
he
heard
some
one
in
his
immediate
neighbourhood
say--hist
this
was
so
sudden
and
so
utterly
unexpected
that
he
not
only
ceased
his
exertions
to
move
the
stone
but
he
nearly
fell
down
in
his
surprise
hist--hist
said
the
voice
again
what--what
gasped
tom
eccles--what
are
you--hush--hush--hush
the
perspiration
broke
out
upon
his
brow
and
he
leaned
against
the
wall
for
support
as
he
managed
to
say
faintly--
well
hush--what
then--hist
well
i
hear
you
where
are
you
here
at
hand
who
are
you
tom
eccles
who
are
you--a
friend
have
you
seen
anything
no
i
wish
i
could
i
should
like
to
see
you
if
i
could--i'm
coming
there
was
a
slow
and
cautious
footstep
and
marchdale
advanced
to
where
tom
eccles
was
standing
come
now
said
the
latter
when
he
saw
the
dusky-looking
form
stalking
towards
him
till
i
know
you
better
i'll
be
obliged
to
you
to
keep
off
i
am
well
armed
keep
your
distance
be
you
friend
or
foe
armed
exclaimed
marchdale
and
he
at
once
paused--yes
i
am
but
i
am
a
friend
i
have
no
sort
of
objection
frankly
to
tell
you
my
errand
i
am
a
friend
of
the
bannerworth
family
and
have
kept
watch
here
now
for
two
nights
in
the
hopes
of
meeting
with
varney
the
vampyre
the
deuce
you
have
and
pray
what
may
your
name
be--marchdale
if
you
be
mr
marchdale
i
know
you
by
sight
for
i
have
seen
you
with
mr
henry
bannerworth
several
times
come
out
from
among
the
shadows
and
let
us
have
a
look
at
you
but
till
you
do
don't
come
within
arm's
length
of
me
i
am
not
naturally
suspicious
but
we
cannot
be
too
careful
oh
certainly--certainly
the
silver
edge
of
the
moon
is
now
just
peeping
up
from
the
east
and
you
will
be
able
to
see
me
well
if
you
step
from
the
shadow
of
the
wall
by
which
you
now
are
this
was
a
reasonable
enough
proposition
and
tom
eccles
at
once
acceded
to
it
by
stepping
out
boldly
into
the
partial
moonlight
which
now
began
to
fall
upon
the
open
meadows
tinting
the
grass
with
a
silvery
refulgence
and
rendering
even
minute
objects
visible
the
moment
he
saw
marchdale
he
knew
him
and
advancing
frankly
to
him
he
said--
i
know
you
sir
well
and
what
brings
you
here--a
wager
for
one
thing
and
a
wish
to
see
the
vampyre
for
another
indeed--yes
i
must
own
i
have
such
a
wish
along
with
a
still
stronger
one
to
capture
him
if
possible
and
as
there
are
now
two
of
us
why
may
we
not
do
it
as
for
capturing
him
said
marchdale
i
should
prefer
shooting
him--you
would
i
would
indeed
i
have
seen
him
once
shot
down
and
he
is
now
i
have
no
doubt
as
well
as
ever
what
were
you
doing
with
that
huge
stone
i
saw
you
bending
over--i
have
some
handkerchiefs
to
hide
here
as
a
proof
that
i
have
to-night
really
been
to
this
place
oh
i
will
show
you
a
better
spot
where
there
is
a
crevice
in
which
you
can
place
them
with
perfect
safety
will
you
walk
with
me
into
the
ruins--willingly
it's
odd
enough
remarked
marchdale
after
he
had
shown
tom
eccles
where
to
hide
the
handkerchiefs
that
you
and
i
should
both
be
here
upon
so
similar
an
errand--i'm
very
glad
of
it
it
robs
the
place
of
its
gloom
and
makes
it
ten
times
more
endurable
than
it
otherwise
would
be
what
do
you
propose
to
do
if
you
see
the
vampyre
i
shall
try
a
pistol
bullet
on
him
you
say
you
are
armed--yes
with
pistols--one
here
it
is
a
huge
weapon
loaded
well
of
course--oh
yes
i
can
depend
upon
it
but
i
did
not
intend
to
use
it
unless
assailed
'tis
well
what
is
that--what--what
don't
you
see
anything
there
come
farther
back
look--look
at
the
corner
of
that
wall
there
i
am
certain
there
is
the
flutter
of
a
human
garment--there
is--there
is
hush
keep
close
it
must
be
the
vampyre--give
me
my
pistol
what
are
you
doing
with
it
only
ramming
down
the
charge
more
firmly
for
you
take
it
if
that
be
varney
the
vampyre
i
shall
challenge
him
to
surrender
the
moment
he
appears
and
if
he
does
not
i
will
fire
upon
him
and
do
you
do
so
likewise--well
i--i
don't
know
you
have
scruples--i
certainly
have
well
well--don't
you
fire
then
but
leave
it
to
me
there
look--look
now
have
you
any
doubt
there
he
goes
in
his
cloak
it
is--it
is------varney
by
heavens
cried
tom
eccles
illustration
surrender
shouted
marchdale
at
the
instant
sir
francis
varney
sprang
forward
and
made
off
at
a
rapid
pace
across
the
meadows
fire
after
him--fire
cried
marchdale
or
he
will
escape
my
pistol
has
missed
fire
he
will
be
off
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
and
thus
urged
by
the
voice
and
the
gesture
of
his
companion
tom
eccles
took
aim
as
well
as
he
could
and
fired
after
the
retreating
form
of
sir
francis
varney
his
conscience
smote
him
as
he
heard
the
report
and
saw
the
flash
of
the
large
pistol
amid
the
half
sort
of
darkness
that
was
still
around
the
effect
of
the
shot
was
then
to
him
painfully
apparent
he
saw
varney
stop
instantly
then
make
a
vain
attempt
to
stagger
forward
a
little
and
finally
fall
heavily
to
the
earth
with
all
the
appearance
of
one
killed
upon
the
spot
you
have
hit
him
said
marchdale--you
have
hit
him
bravo--i
have--hit
him
yes
a
capital
shot
by
jove--i
am
very
sorry
sorry
sorry
for
ridding
the
world
of
such
a
being
what
was
in
your
pistol--a
couple
of
slugs
well
they
have
made
a
lodgment
in
him
that's
quite
clear
let's
go
up
and
finish
him
at
once--he
seems
finished
i
beg
your
pardon
there
when
the
moonbeams
fall
upon
him
he'll
get
up
and
walk
away
as
if
nothing
was
the
matter--will
he
cried
tom
with
animation--will
he
certainly
he
will--thank
god
for
that
now
hark
you
mr
marchdale
i
should
not
have
fired
if
you
had
not
at
the
moment
urged
me
to
do
so
now
i
shall
stay
and
see
if
the
effect
which
you
talk
of
will
ensue
and
although
it
may
convince
me
that
he
is
a
vampyre
and
that
there
are
such
things
he
may
go
off
scot
free
for
me
go
off--yes
i
don't
want
to
have
even
a
vampyre's
blood
upon
my
hands
you
are
exceedingly
delicate--perhaps
i
am
it's
my
way
though
i
have
shot
him--not
you
mind
so
in
a
manner
of
speaking
he
belongs
to
me
now
mark
me
i
won't
have
him
touched
any
more
to-night
unless
you
think
there's
a
chance
of
making
a
prisoner
of
him
without
violence
there
he
lies
you
can
go
and
make
a
prisoner
of
him
at
once
dead
as
he
is
and
if
you
take
him
out
of
the
moonlight--
i
understand
he
won't
recover--certainly
not
but
as
i
want
him
to
recover
that
don't
suit
me--well
i
cannot
but
honour
your
scruples
although
i
do
not
actually
share
in
them
but
i
promise
you
that
since
such
is
your
wish
i
will
take
no
steps
against
the
vampyre
but
let
us
come
up
to
him
and
see
if
he
be
really
dead
or
only
badly
wounded
tom
eccles
hang
back
a
little
from
this
proposal
but
upon
being
urged
again
by
marchdale
and
told
that
he
need
not
go
closer
than
he
chose
he
consented
and
the
two
of
them
approached
the
prostrate
form
of
sir
francis
varney
which
lay
upon
its
face
in
the
faint
moonlight
which
each
moment
was
gathering
strength
and
power
he
lies
upon
his
face
said
marchdale
will
you
go
and
turn
him
over--who--i
god
forbid
i
should
touch
him
well--well
i
will
come
on
they
halted
within
a
couple
of
yards
of
the
body
tom
eccles
would
not
go
a
step
farther
so
marchdale
advanced
alone
and
pretended
to
be
with
great
repugnance
examining
for
the
wound
he
is
quite
dead
he
said
but
i
cannot
see
the
hurt--i
think
he
turned
his
head
as
i
fired
did
he
let
us
see
marchdale
lifted
up
the
head
and
disclosed
such
a
mass
of
clotted-looking
blood
that
tom
eccles
at
once
took
to
his
heels
nor
stopped
until
he
was
nearly
as
far
off
as
the
ruins
marchdale
followed
him
more
slowly
and
when
he
came
up
to
him
he
said--
the
slugs
have
taken
effect
on
his
face--i
know
it--i
know
it
don't
tell
me
he
looks
horrible--and
i
am
a
murderer
psha
you
look
upon
this
matter
too
seriously
think
of
who
and
what
he
was
and
then
you
will
soon
acquit
yourself
of
being
open
to
any
such
charge--i
am
bewildered
mr
marchdale
and
cannot
now
know
whether
he
be
a
vampyre
or
not
if
he
be
not
i
have
murdered
most
unjustifiably
a
fellow-creature
well
but
if
he
be--why
even
then
i
do
not
know
but
that
i
ought
to
consider
myself
as
guilty
he
is
one
of
god's
creatures
if
he
were
ten
times
a
vampyre
well
you
really
do
take
a
serious
view
of
the
affair--not
more
serious
than
it
deserves
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do--i
shall
remain
here
to
await
the
result
of
what
you
tell
me
will
ensue
if
he
be
a
real
vampire
even
now
the
moonbeams
are
full
upon
him
and
each
moment
increasing
in
intensity
think
you
he
will
recover
i
do
indeed--then
here
will
i
wait
since
that
is
you
resolve
i
will
keep
you
company
we
shall
easily
find
some
old
stone
in
the
ruins
which
will
serve
us
for
a
seat
and
there
at
leisure
we
can
keep
our
eyes
upon
the
dead
body
and
be
able
to
observe
if
it
make
the
least
movement
this
plan
was
adopted
and
they
sat
down
just
within
the
ruins
but
in
such
a
place
that
they
had
a
full
view
of
the
dead
body
as
it
appeared
to
be
of
sir
francis
varney
upon
which
the
sweet
moonbeams
shone
full
and
clear
tom
eccles
related
how
he
was
incited
to
come
upon
his
expedition
but
he
might
have
spared
himself
that
trouble
as
marchdale
had
been
in
a
retired
corner
of
the
inn
parlour
before
he
came
to
his
appointment
with
varney
and
heard
the
business
for
the
most
part
proposed
half-an-hour
certainly
not
more
might
have
elapsed
when
suddenly
tom
eccles
uttered
an
exclamation
partly
of
surprise
and
partly
of
terror--
he
moves
he
moves
he
cried
look
at
the
vampyre's
body
marchdale
affected
to
look
with
an
all-absorbing
interest
and
there
was
sir
francis
varney
raising
slowly
one
arm
with
the
hand
outstretched
towards
the
moon
as
if
invoking
that
luminary
to
shed
more
of
its
beams
upon
him
then
the
body
moved
slowly
like
some
one
writhing
in
pain
and
yet
unable
to
move
from
the
spot
on
which
it
lay
from
the
head
to
the
foot
the
whole
frame
seemed
to
be
convulsed
and
now
and
then
as
the
ghastly
object
seemed
to
be
gathering
more
strength
the
limbs
were
thrown
out
with
a
rapid
and
a
frightful
looking
violence
it
was
truly
to
one
who
might
look
upon
it
as
a
reality
and
no
juggle
a
frightful
sight
to
see
and
although
marchdale
of
course
tolerably
well
preserved
his
equanimity
only
now
and
then
for
appearance
sake
affecting
to
be
wonderfully
shocked
poor
tom
eccles
was
in
such
a
state
of
horror
and
fright
that
he
could
not
if
he
would
have
flown
from
the
spot
so
fascinated
was
he
by
the
horrible
spectacle
this
was
a
state
of
things
which
continued
for
many
minutes
and
then
the
body
showed
evident
symptoms
of
so
much
returning
animation
that
it
was
about
to
rise
from
his
gory
bed
and
mingle
once
again
with
the
living
behold
said
marchdale--behold--heaven
have
mercy
upon
us
it
is
as
i
said
the
beams
of
the
moon
have
revived
the
vampyre
you
perceive
now
that
there
can
be
no
doubt--yes
yes
i
see
him
i
see
him
sir
francis
varney
now
as
if
with
a
great
struggle
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
up
at
the
bright
moon
for
some
moments
with
such
an
air
and
manner
that
it
would
not
have
required
any
very
great
amount
of
imagination
to
conceive
that
he
was
returning
to
it
some
sort
of
thanksgiving
for
the
good
that
it
had
done
to
him
he
then
seemed
for
some
moments
in
a
state
of
considerable
indecision
as
to
which
way
he
should
proceed
he
turned
round
several
times
then
he
advanced
a
step
or
two
towards
the
house
but
apparently
his
resolution
changed
again
and
casting
his
eyes
upon
the
ruins
he
at
once
made
towards
them
this
was
too
much
for
the
philosophy
as
well
as
for
the
courage
of
tom
eccles
it
was
all
very
well
to
look
on
at
some
distance
and
observe
the
wonderful
and
inexplicable
proceedings
of
the
vampyre
but
when
he
showed
symptoms
of
making
a
nearer
acquaintance
it
was
not
to
be
borne
why
he's
coming
here
said
tom--he
seems
so
indeed
remarked
marchdale
do
you
mean
to
stay--i
think
i
shall
you
do
do
you--yes
i
should
much
like
to
question
him
and
as
we
are
two
to
one
i
think
we
really
can
have
nothing
to
fear
do
you
i'm
altogether
of
a
different
opinion
a
man
who
has
more
lives
than
a
cat
don't
much
mind
at
what
odds
he
fights
you
may
stay
if
you
like--you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
will
desert
me
i
don't
see
a
bit
how
you
call
it
deserting
you
if
we
had
come
out
together
on
this
adventure
i
would
have
stayed
it
out
with
you
but
as
we
came
separate
and
independent
we
may
as
well
go
back
so--well
but--
good
morning
cried
tom
and
he
at
once
took
to
his
heels
towards
the
town
without
staying
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
remonstrances
of
marchdale
who
called
after
him
in
vain
sir
francis
varney
probably
had
tom
eccles
not
gone
off
so
rapidly
would
have
yet
taken
another
thought
and
gone
in
another
direction
than
that
which
led
him
to
the
ruins
and
tom
if
he
had
had
his
senses
fully
about
him
as
well
as
all
his
powers
of
perception
would
have
seen
that
the
progress
of
the
vampyre
was
very
slow
while
he
continued
to
converse
with
marchdale
and
that
it
was
only
when
he
went
off
at
good
speed
that
sir
francis
varney
likewise
thought
it
prudent
to
do
so
is
he
much
terrified
said
varney
as
he
came
up
to
marchdale--yes
most
completely
this
then
will
make
a
good
story
in
the
town--it
will
indeed
and
not
a
little
enhance
your
reputation
well
well
it
don't
much
matter
now
but
if
by
terrifying
people
i
can
purchase
for
myself
anything
like
immunity
for
the
past
i
shall
be
satisfied--i
think
you
may
now
safely
reckon
that
you
have
done
so
this
man
who
has
fled
with
so
much
precipitation
had
courage
unquestionably--or
else
he
would
have
shrunk
from
coming
here
at
all
true
but
his
courage
and
presence
arose
from
his
strong
doubts
as
to
the
existence
of
such
beings
as
vampyres--yes
and
now
that
he
is
convinced
his
bravery
has
evaporated
along
with
his
doubts
and
such
a
tale
as
he
has
now
to
tell
will
be
found
sufficient
to
convert
even
the
most
sceptical
in
the
town
i
hope
so--and
yet
it
cannot
much
avail
you
not
personally
but
i
must
confess
that
i
am
not
dead
to
all
human
opinions
and
i
feel
some
desire
of
revenge
against
those
dastards
who
by
hundreds
have
hunted
me
burnt
down
my
mansion
and
sought
my
destruction--that
i
do
not
wonder
at
i
would
fain
leave
among
them
a
legacy
of
fear
such
fear
as
shall
haunt
them
and
their
children
for
years
to
come
i
would
wish
that
the
name
of
varney
the
vampire
should
be
a
sound
of
terror
for
generations--it
will
be
so
it
shall--and
now
then
for
a
consideration
of
what
is
to
be
done
with
our
prisoner
what
is
your
resolve
upon
that
point
i
have
considered
it
while
i
was
lying
upon
yon
green
sward
waiting
for
the
friendly
moonbeams
to
fall
upon
my
face
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
sort
of
resource
but
to------kill
him
no
no--what
then
to
set
him
free--nay
have
you
considered
the
immense
hazard
of
doing
so
think
again
i
pray
you
think
again
i
am
decidedly
of
opinion
that
he
more
than
suspects
who
are
his
enemies
and
in
that
case
you
know
what
consequences
would
ensue
besides
have
we
not
enough
already
to
encounter
why
should
we
add
another
young
bold
determined
spirit
to
the
band
which
is
already
arrayed
against
us
you
talk
in
vain
marchdale
i
know
to
what
it
all
tends
you
have
a
strong
desire
for
the
death
of
this
young
man--no
there
you
wrong
me
i
have
no
desire
for
his
death
for
its
own
sake
but
where
great
interests
are
at
stake
there
must
be
sacrifices
made
so
there
must
therefore
i
will
make
a
sacrifice
and
let
this
young
prisoner
free
from
his
dungeon--if
such
be
your
determination
i
know
well
it
is
useless
to
combat
with
it
when
do
you
purpose
giving
him
his
freedom
i
will
not
act
so
heedlessly
as
that
your
principles
of
caution
shall
blame
me
i
will
attempt
to
get
from
him
some
promise
that
he
will
not
make
himself
an
active
instrument
against
me
perchance
too
as
bannerworth
hall
which
he
is
sure
to
visit
wears
such
an
air
of
desertion
i
may
be
able
to
persuade
him
that
the
bannerworth
family
as
well
as
his
uncle
have
left
this
part
of
the
country
altogether
so
that
without
making
any
inquiry
for
them
about
the
neighbourhood
he
may
be
induced
to
leave
at
once--that
would
be
well
good
your
prudence
approves
of
the
plan
and
therefore
it
shall
be
done--i
am
rather
inclined
to
think
said
marchdale
with
a
slight
tone
of
sarcasm
that
if
my
prudence
did
not
approve
of
the
plan
it
would
still
be
done
most
probably
said
varney
calmly--will
you
release
him
to-night
it
is
morning
now
and
soon
the
soft
grey
light
of
day
will
tint
the
east
i
do
not
think
i
will
release
him
till
sunset
again
now
has
he
provision
to
last
him
until
then--he
has
well
then
two
hours
after
sunset
i
will
come
here
and
release
him
from
his
weary
bondage
and
now
i
must
go
to
find
some
place
in
which
to
hide
my
proscribed
head
as
for
bannerworth
hall
i
will
yet
have
it
in
my
power
i
have
sworn
to
do
so
i
will
keep
my
oath--the
accomplishment
of
our
purpose
i
regret
to
say
seems
as
far
off
as
ever
not
so--not
so
as
i
before
remarked
we
must
disappear
for
a
time
so
as
to
lull
suspicion
there
will
then
arise
a
period
when
bannerworth
hall
will
neither
be
watched
as
it
is
now
nor
will
it
be
inhabited--a
period
before
the
bannerworth
family
has
made
up
its
mind
to
go
back
to
it
and
when
long
watching
without
a
result
has
become
too
tiresome
to
be
continued
at
all
then
we
can
at
once
pursue
our
object--be
it
so
and
now
marchdale
i
want
more
money--more
money
yes
you
know
well
that
i
have
had
large
demands
of
late--but
i
certainly
had
an
impression
that
you
were
possessed
by
the
death
of
some
one
with
very
ample
means
yes
but
there
is
a
means
by
which
all
is
taken
from
me
i
have
no
real
resources
but
what
are
rapidly
used
up
so
i
must
come
upon
you
again--i
have
already
completely
crippled
myself
as
regards
money
matters
in
this
enterprise
and
i
do
certainly
hope
that
the
fruits
will
not
be
far
distant
if
they
be
much
longer
delayed
i
shall
really
not
know
what
to
do
however
come
to
the
lodge
where
you
have
been
staying
and
then
i
will
give
you
to
the
extent
of
my
ability
whatever
sum
you
think
your
present
exigencies
require
come
on
then
at
once
i
would
certainly
of
course
rather
leave
this
place
now
before
daybreak
come
on
i
say
come
on
sir
francis
varney
and
marchdale
walked
for
some
time
in
silence
across
the
meadows
it
was
evident
that
there
was
not
between
these
associates
the
very
best
of
feelings
marchdale
was
always
smarting
under
an
assumption
of
authority
over
him
on
the
part
of
sir
francis
varney
while
the
latter
scarcely
cared
to
conceal
any
portion
of
the
contempt
with
which
he
regarded
his
hypocritical
companion
some
very
strong
band
of
union
indeed
must
surely
bind
these
two
strange
persons
together
it
must
be
something
of
a
more
than
common
nature
which
induces
marchdale
not
only
to
obey
the
behests
of
his
mysterious
companion
but
to
supply
him
so
readily
with
money
as
we
perceive
he
promises
to
do
and
as
regards
varney
the
vampyre
he
too
must
have
some
great
object
in
view
to
induce
him
to
run
such
a
world
of
risk
and
take
so
much
trouble
as
he
was
doing
with
the
bannerworth
family
what
his
object
is
and
what
is
the
object
of
marchdale
will
now
that
we
have
progressed
so
far
in
our
story
soon
appear
and
then
much
that
is
perfectly
inexplicable
will
become
clear
and
distinct
and
we
shall
find
that
some
strong
human
motives
are
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
varney's
visit
to
the
dungeon
of
the
lonely
prisoner
in
the
ruins
illustration
evident
it
was
that
marchdale
was
not
near
so
scrupulous
as
sir
francis
varney
in
what
he
chose
to
do
he
would
without
hesitation
have
sacrificed
the
life
of
that
prisoner
in
the
lonely
dungeon
whom
it
would
be
an
insult
to
the
understanding
of
our
readers
not
to
presume
that
they
had
long
ere
this
established
in
their
minds
to
be
charles
holland
his
own
safety
seemed
to
be
the
paramount
consideration
with
marchdale
and
it
was
evident
that
he
cared
for
nothing
in
comparison
with
that
object
it
says
much
however
for
sir
francis
varney
that
he
did
not
give
in
to
such
a
blood-thirsty
feeling
but
rather
chose
to
set
the
prisoner
free
and
run
all
the
chances
of
the
danger
to
which
he
might
expose
himself
by
such
a
course
of
conduct
than
to
insure
safety
comparatively
by
his
destruction
sir
francis
varney
is
evidently
a
character
of
strangely
mixed
feelings
it
is
quite
evident
that
he
has
some
great
object
in
view
which
he
wishes
to
accomplish
almost
at
any
risk
but
it
is
equally
evident
at
the
same
time
that
he
wishes
to
do
so
with
the
least
possible
injury
to
others
or
else
he
would
never
have
behaved
as
he
had
done
in
his
interview
with
the
beautiful
and
persecuted
flora
bannerworth
or
now
suggested
the
idea
of
setting
charles
holland
free
from
the
dreary
dungeon
in
which
he
had
been
so
long
confined
we
are
always
anxious
and
willing
to
give
every
one
credit
for
the
good
that
is
in
them
and
hence
we
are
pleased
to
find
that
sir
francis
varney
despite
his
singular
and
apparently
preternatural
capabilities
has
something
sufficiently
human
about
his
mind
and
feelings
to
induce
him
to
do
as
little
injury
as
possible
to
others
in
the
pursuit
of
his
own
objects
of
the
two
vampyre
as
he
is
we
prefer
him
much
to
the
despicable
and
hypocritical
marchdale
who
under
the
pretence
of
being
the
friend
of
the
bannerworth
family
would
freely
have
inflicted
upon
them
the
most
deadly
injuries
it
was
quite
clear
that
he
was
most
dreadfully
disappointed
that
sir
francis
varney
would
not
permit
him
to
take
the
life
of
charles
holland
and
it
was
with
a
gloomy
and
dissatisfied
air
that
he
left
the
ruins
to
proceed
towards
the
town
after
what
we
may
almost
term
the
altercation
he
had
had
with
varney
the
vampyre
upon
that
subject
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
sir
francis
varney
however
was
blind
to
the
danger
which
must
inevitably
accrue
from
permitting
charles
holland
once
more
to
obtain
his
liberty
what
the
latter
would
be
able
to
state
would
be
more
than
sufficient
to
convince
the
bannerworths
and
all
interested
in
their
fortunes
that
something
was
going
on
of
a
character
which
however
supernatural
it
might
seem
to
be
still
seemed
to
have
some
human
and
ordinary
objects
for
its
ends
sir
francis
varney
thought
over
all
this
before
he
proceeded
according
to
his
promise
to
the
dungeon
of
the
prisoner
but
it
would
seem
as
if
there
was
considerable
difficulty
even
to
an
individual
of
his
long
practice
in
all
kinds
of
chicanery
and
deceit
in
arriving
at
any
satisfactory
conclusion
as
to
a
means
of
making
charles
holland's
release
a
matter
of
less
danger
to
himself
than
it
would
be
likely
to
be
if
unfettered
by
obligation
he
was
at
once
set
free
at
the
solemn
hour
of
midnight
while
all
was
still
that
is
to
say
on
the
night
succeeding
the
one
on
which
he
had
had
the
interview
with
marchdale
we
have
recorded
sir
francis
varney
alone
sought
the
silent
ruins
he
was
attired
as
usual
in
his
huge
cloak
and
indeed
the
chilly
air
of
the
evening
warranted
such
protection
against
its
numerous
discomforts
had
any
one
seen
him
however
that
evening
they
would
have
observed
an
air
of
great
doubt
and
irresolution
upon
his
brow
as
if
he
were
struggling
with
some
impulses
which
he
found
it
extremely
difficult
to
restrain
i
know
well
he
muttered
as
he
walked
among
the
shadow
of
the
ruins
that
marchdale's
reasoning
is
coldly
and
horribly
correct
when
he
says
that
there
is
danger
in
setting
this
youth
free
but
i
am
about
to
leave
this
place
and
not
to
show
myself
for
some
time
and
i
cannot
reconcile
myself
to
inflicting
upon
him
the
horror
of
a
death
by
starvation
which
must
ensue
it
was
a
night
of
more
than
usual
dullness
and
as
sir
francis
varney
removed
the
massy
stone
which
hid
the
narrow
and
tortuous
entrance
to
the
dungeons
a
chilly
feeling
crept
over
him
and
he
could
not
help
supposing
that
even
then
marchdale
might
have
played
him
false
and
neglected
to
supply
the
prisoner
food
according
to
his
promise
hastily
he
descended
to
the
dungeons
and
with
a
step
which
had
in
it
far
less
of
caution
than
had
usually
characterised
his
proceedings
he
proceeded
onwards
until
he
reached
that
particular
dungeon
in
which
our
young
friend
to
whom
we
wished
so
well
had
been
so
long
confined
from
the
beautiful
and
cheering
light
of
day
and
from
all
that
his
heart's
best
affections
most
cling
to
speak
said
sir
francis
varney
as
he
entered
the
dungeon--if
the
occupant
of
this
dreary
place
live
let
him
answer
one
who
is
as
much
his
friend
as
he
has
been
his
enemy
i
have
no
friend
said
charles
holland
faintly
unless
it
be
one
who
would
come
and
restore
me
to
liberty
and
how
know
you
that
i
am
not
he
your
voice
sounds
like
that
of
one
of
my
persecutors
why
do
you
not
place
the
climax
to
your
injuries
by
at
once
taking
away
life
i
should
be
better
pleased
that
you
would
do
so
than
that
i
should
wear
out
the
useless
struggle
of
existence
in
so
dreary
and
wretched
an
abode
as
this
young
man
said
sir
francis
varney
i
have
come
to
you
on
a
greater
errand
of
mercy
than
probably
you
will
ever
give
me
credit
for
there
is
one
who
would
too
readily
have
granted
your
present
request
and
who
would
at
once
have
taken
that
life
of
which
you
profess
to
be
so
wearied
but
which
may
yet
present
to
you
some
of
its
sunniest
and
most
beautiful
aspects
your
tones
are
friendly
said
charles
but
yet
i
dread
some
new
deception
that
you
are
one
of
those
who
consigned
me
by
stratagem
and
by
brute
force
to
this
place
of
durance
i
am
perfectly
well
assured
and
therefore
any
good
that
may
be
promised
by
you
presents
itself
to
me
in
a
very
doubtful
character
i
cannot
be
surprised
said
sir
francis
varney
at
such
sentiments
arising
from
your
lips
but
nevertheless
i
am
inclined
to
save
you
you
have
been
detained
here
because
it
was
supposed
by
being
so
a
particular
object
would
be
best
obtained
by
your
absence
that
object
however
has
failed
notwithstanding
and
i
do
not
feel
further
inclined
to
protract
your
sufferings
have
you
any
guess
as
to
the
parties
who
have
thus
confined
you--i
am
unaccustomed
to
dissemble
and
therefore
i
will
say
at
once
that
i
have
a
guess
in
which
way
does
it
tend--
against
sir
francis
varney
called
the
vampyre
does
it
not
strike
you
that
this
may
be
a
dangerous
candour--it
may
or
it
may
not
be
i
cannot
help
it
i
know
i
am
at
the
mercy
of
my
foes
and
i
do
not
believe
that
anything
i
can
say
or
do
will
make
my
situation
worse
or
better
you
are
much
mistaken
there
in
other
hands
than
mine
it
might
make
it
much
worse
but
it
happens
to
be
one
of
my
weaknesses
that
i
am
charged
with
candour
and
that
i
admire
boldness
of
disposition--indeed
and
yet
can
behave
in
the
manner
you
have
done
towards
me
yes
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
on
earth
than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
i
am
the
more
encouraged
to
set
you
free
because
if
i
procure
from
you
a
promise
which
i
intend
to
attempt
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
you
will
keep
it--i
shall
assuredly
keep
whatever
promise
i
may
make
propound
your
conditions
and
if
they
be
such
as
honour
and
honesty
will
permit
me
to
accede
to
i
will
do
so
willingly
and
at
once
heaven
knows
i
am
weary
enough
of
this
miserable
imprisonment
will
you
promise
me
then
if
i
set
you
free
not
to
mention
your
suspicions
that
it
is
to
sir
francis
varney
you
owe
this
ill
turn
and
not
to
attempt
any
act
of
vengeance
against
him
as
a
retaliation
for
it--i
cannot
promise
so
much
as
that
freedom
indeed
would
be
a
poor
boon
if
i
were
not
permitted
freely
to
converse
of
some
of
the
circumstances
connected
with
my
captivity
you
object--i
do
to
the
former
of
your
propositions
but
not
to
the
latter
i
will
promise
not
to
go
at
all
out
of
my
way
to
execute
any
vengeance
upon
you
but
i
will
not
promise
that
i
will
not
communicate
the
circumstances
of
my
forced
absence
from
them
to
those
friends
whose
opinion
i
so
much
value
and
to
return
to
whom
is
almost
as
dear
to
me
as
liberty
itself
sir
francis
varney
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
he
said
in
a
tone
of
deep
solemnity--
there
are
ninety-nine
persons
out
of
a
hundred
who
would
take
your
life
for
the
independence
of
your
tongue
but
i
am
as
the
hundredth
one
who
looks
with
a
benevolent
eye
at
your
proceedings
will
you
promise
me
if
i
remove
the
fetters
which
now
bind
your
limbs
that
you
will
make
no
personal
attack
upon
me
for
i
am
weary
of
personal
contention
and
i
have
no
disposition
to
endure
it
will
you
make
me
this
promise--i
promise--i
will
without
another
word
but
trusting
implicitly
to
the
promise
which
had
been
given
to
him
sir
francis
varney
produced
a
small
key
from
his
pocket
and
unlocked
with
it
a
padlock
which
confined
the
chains
about
the
prisoner
with
ease
charles
holland
was
then
enabled
to
shake
them
off
and
then
for
the
first
time
for
some
weeks
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
felt
all
the
exquisite
relief
of
being
comparatively
free
from
bondage
this
is
delightful
indeed
he
said
it
is
said
sir
francis
varney--it
is
but
a
foretaste
of
the
happiness
you
will
enjoy
when
you
are
entirely
free
you
see
that
i
have
trusted
you
you
have
trusted
me
as
you
might
trust
me
and
you
perceive
that
i
have
kept
my
word
you
have
and
since
you
decline
to
make
me
the
promise
which
i
would
fain
have
from
you
to
the
effect
that
you
would
not
mention
me
as
one
of
the
authors
of
your
calamity
i
must
trust
to
your
honour
not
to
attempt
revenge
for
what
you
have
suffered
that
i
will
promise
there
can
be
but
little
difficulty
to
any
generous
mind
in
giving
up
such
a
feeling
in
consequence
of
your
sparing
me
what
you
might
still
further
have
inflicted
i
will
let
the
past
rest
and
as
if
it
had
never
happened
really
to
me
and
speak
of
it
to
others
but
as
a
circumstance
which
i
wish
not
to
revert
to
but
prefer
should
be
buried
in
oblivion
it
is
well
and
now
i
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
which
perhaps
you
will
consider
the
hardest
of
all
name
it
i
feel
myself
bound
to
a
considerable
extent
to
comply
with
whatever
you
may
demand
of
me
that
is
not
contrary
to
honourable
principle
then
it
is
this
that
comparatively
free
as
you
are
and
in
a
condition
as
you
are
to
assert
your
own
freedom
you
will
not
do
so
hastily
or
for
a
considerable
period
in
fact
i
wish
and
expect
that
you
should
wait
yet
awhile
until
it
shall
suit
me
to
say
that
it
is
my
pleasure
that
you
shall
be
free
that
is
indeed
a
hard
condition
to
man
who
feels
as
you
yourself
remark
that
he
can
assert
his
freedom
it
is
one
which
i
have
still
a
hope
you
will
not
persevere
in
nay
young
man
i
think
that
i
have
treated
you
with
generosity
to
make
you
feel
that
i
am
not
the
worst
of
foes
you
could
have
had
all
i
require
of
you
is
that
you
should
wait
here
for
about
an
hour
it
is
now
nearly
one
o'clock
will
you
wait
until
you
hear
it
strike
two
before
you
actually
make
a
movement
to
leave
this
place
charles
holland
hesitated
for
some
moments
and
then
he
said--
do
not
fancy
that
i
am
not
one
who
appreciates
the
singular
trust
you
have
reposed
in
me
and
however
repugnant
to
me
it
may
be
to
remain
here
a
voluntary
prisoner
i
am
inclined
to
do
so
if
it
be
but
to
convince
you
that
the
trust
you
have
reposed
in
me
is
not
in
vain
and
that
i
can
behave
with
equal
generosity
to
you
as
you
can
to
me
be
it
so
said
sir
francis
varney
i
shall
leave
you
with
a
full
reliance
that
you
will
keep
your
word
and
now
farewell
when
you
think
of
me
fancy
me
rather
one
unfortunate
than
criminal
and
tell
yourself
that
even
varney
the
vampyre
had
some
traits
in
his
character
which
although
they
might
not
raise
your
esteem
at
all
events
did
not
loudly
call
for
your
reprobation
i
shall
do
so
oh
flora
flora
i
shall
look
upon
you
once
again
after
believing
and
thinking
that
i
had
bidden
you
a
long
and
last
adieu
my
own
beautiful
flora
it
is
joy
indeed
to
think
that
i
shall
look
upon
that
face
again
which
to
my
perception
is
full
of
all
the
majesty
of
loveliness
sir
francis
varney
looked
coldly
on
while
charles
uttered
this
enthusiastic
speech
remember
he
said
till
two
o'clock
and
he
walked
towards
the
door
of
the
dungeon
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
your
way
out
from
this
place
doubtless
you
already
perceive
the
entrance
by
which
i
gained
admission
had
i
been
free
said
charles
and
had
the
use
of
my
limbs
i
should
long
ere
this
have
worked
my
way
to
life
and
liberty
'tis
well
goodnight
varney
walked
from
the
place
and
just
closed
the
door
behind
him
with
a
slow
and
stately
step
he
left
the
ruins
and
charles
holland
found
himself
once
more
alone
but
in
a
much
more
enviable
condition
than
for
many
weeks
he
could
have
called
his
flora
bannerworth's
apparent
inconsistency--the
admiral's
circumstances
and
advice--mr
chillingworth's
mysterious
absence
illustration
for
a
brief
space
let
us
return
to
flora
bannerworth
who
had
suffered
so
much
on
account
of
her
affections
as
well
as
on
account
of
the
mysterious
attack
that
had
been
made
upon
her
by
the
reputed
vampyre
after
leaving
bannerworth
hall
for
a
short
time
she
seemed
to
recover
her
spirits
but
this
was
a
state
of
things
which
did
not
last
and
only
showed
how
fallacious
it
was
to
expect
that
after
the
grievous
things
that
had
happened
she
would
rapidly
recover
her
equanimity
it
is
said
by
learned
physiologists
that
two
bodily
pains
cannot
endure
at
the
same
space
of
time
in
the
system
and
whether
it
be
so
or
not
is
a
question
concerning
which
it
would
be
foreign
to
the
nature
of
our
work
to
enter
into
anything
like
an
elaborate
disquisition
certainly
however
so
far
as
flora
bannerworth
was
concerned
she
seemed
inclined
to
show
that
mentally
the
observation
was
a
true
one
for
that
now
she
became
released
from
a
continued
dread
of
the
visits
of
the
vampyre
her
mind
would
with
more
painful
interest
than
ever
recur
to
the
melancholy
condition
probably
of
charles
holland
if
he
were
alive
and
to
soul-harrowing
reflections
concerning
him
if
he
were
dead
she
could
not
and
she
did
not
believe
for
one
moment
that
his
desertion
of
her
had
been
of
a
voluntary
character
she
knew
or
fancied
she
knew
him
by
far
too
well
for
that
and
she
more
than
once
expressed
her
opinion
to
the
effect
that
she
was
perfectly
convinced
his
disappearance
was
a
part
and
parcel
of
all
that
train
of
circumstances
which
had
so
recently
occurred
and
produced
such
a
world
of
unhappiness
to
her
as
well
as
to
the
whole
of
the
bannerworth
family
if
he
had
never
loved
me
she
said
to
her
brother
henry
he
would
have
been
alive
and
well
but
he
has
fallen
a
victim
to
the
truth
of
a
passion
and
to
the
constancy
of
an
affection
which
to
my
dying
day
i
will
believe
in
now
that
mr
marchdale
had
left
the
place
there
was
no
one
to
dispute
this
proposition
with
flora
for
all
as
well
as
she
were
fully
inclined
to
think
well
of
charles
holland
it
was
on
the
very
morning
which
preceded
that
evening
when
sir
francis
varney
called
upon
charles
holland
in
the
manner
we
have
related
with
the
gratifying
news
that
upon
certain
conditions
he
might
be
released
that
flora
bannerworth
when
the
admiral
came
to
see
them
spoke
to
him
of
charles
holland
saying--
now
sir
that
i
am
away
from
bannerworth
hall
i
do
not
and
cannot
feel
satisfied
for
the
thought
that
charles
may
eventually
come
back
and
seek
us
there
still
haunts
me
fancy
him
sir
doing
so
and
seeing
the
place
completely
deserted
well
there's
something
in
that
said
the
admiral
but
however
he's
hardly
such
a
goose
if
it
were
so
to
happen
to
give
up
the
chase--he'd
find
us
out
somehow
you
think
he
would
sir
or
do
you
not
think
that
despair
would
seize
upon
him
and
that
fancying
we
had
all
left
the
spot
for
ever
he
might
likewise
do
so
so
that
we
should
lose
him
more
effectually
than
we
have
done
at
present
no
hardly
said
the
admiral
he
couldn't
be
such
a
goose
as
that
why
when
i
was
of
his
age
if
i
had
secured
the
affections
of
a
young
girl
like
you
i'd
have
gone
over
all
the
world
but
i'd
have
found
out
where
she
was
and
what
i
mean
to
say
is
if
he's
half
such
a
goose
as
you
think
him
he
deserves
to
lose
you
did
you
not
tell
me
something
sir
of
mr
chillingworth
talking
of
taking
possession
of
the
hall
for
a
brief
space
of
time
why
yes
i
did
and
i
expect
he
is
there
now
in
fact
i'm
sure
he's
there
for
he
said
he
would
be
no
he
ain't
said
jack
pringle
at
that
moment
entering
the
room
you're
wrong
again
as
you
always
are
somehow
or
other
what
you
vagabond
are
you
here
you
mutinous
rascal--ay
ay
sir
go
on
don't
mind
me
i
wonder
what
you'd
do
sir
if
you
hadn't
somebody
like
me
to
go
on
talking
about
why
you
infernal
rascal
i
wonder
what
you'd
do
if
you
had
not
an
indulgent
commander
who
puts
up
even
with
real
mutiny
and
says
nothing
about
it
but
where
have
you
been
did
you
go
as
i
directed
you
and
take
some
provisions
to
bannerworth
hall
yes
i
did
but
i
brought
them
back
again
there's
nobody
there
and
don't
seem
likely
to
be
except
a
dead
body
a
dead
body
whose
body
can
that
be--tom
somebody
for
i'm
d----d
if
it
ain't
a
great
he
cat
you
scoundrel
how
dare
you
alarm
me
in
such
a
way
but
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
did
not
see
dr
chillingworth
at
the
hall--how
could
i
see
him
if
he
wasn't
there
but
he
was
there
he
said
he
would
be
there--then
he's
gone
again
for
there's
nobody
there
that
i
know
of
in
the
shape
of
a
doctor
i
went
through
every
part
of
the
ship--i
mean
the
house--and
the
deuce
a
soul
could
i
find
so
as
it
was
rather
lonely
and
uncomfortable
i
came
away
again
'who
knows'
thought
i
'but
some
blessed
vampyre
or
another
may
come
across
me'
this
won't
do
said
the
old
admiral
buttoning
up
his
coat
to
the
chin
bannerworth
hall
must
not
be
deserted
in
this
way
it
is
quite
clear
that
sir
francis
varney
and
his
associates
have
some
particular
object
in
view
in
getting
possession
of
the
place
here
you
jack--ay
ay
sir
illustration
just
go
back
again
and
stay
at
the
hall
till
somebody
comes
to
you
even
such
a
stupid
hound
as
you
will
be
something
to
scare
away
unwelcome
visitors
go
back
to
the
hall
i
say
what
are
you
staring
at--back
to
bannerworth
hall
said
jack
what
just
where
i've
come
from
all
that
way
off
and
nothing
to
eat
and
what's
worse
nothing
to
drink
i'll
see
you
d----d
first
the
admiral
caught
up
a
table-fork
and
made
a
rush
at
jack
but
henry
bannerworth
interfered
no
no
he
said
admiral
no
no--not
that
you
must
recollect
that
you
yourself
have
given
this
no
doubt
faithful
fellow
of
your's
liberty
to
do
and
say
a
great
many
things
which
don't
look
like
good
service
but
i
have
no
doubt
from
what
i
have
seen
of
his
disposition
that
he
would
risk
his
life
rather
than
that
you
should
come
to
any
harm
ay
ay
said
jack
he
quite
forgets
when
the
bullets
were
scuttling
our
nobs
off
cape
ushant
when
that
big
frenchman
had
hold
of
him
by
the
skirf
of
his
neck
and
began
pummelling
his
head
and
the
lee
scuppers
were
running
with
blood
and
a
bit
of
joe
wiggins's
brains
had
come
slap
in
my
eye
while
some
of
jack
marling's
guts
was
hanging
round
my
neck
like
a
nosegay
all
in
consequence
of
grape-shot--then
he
didn't
say
as
i
was
a
swab
when
i
came
up
and
bored
a
hole
in
the
frenchman's
back
with
a
pike
ay
it's
all
very
well
now
when
there's
peace
and
no
danger
to
call
jack
pringle
a
lubberly
rascal
and
mutinous
i'm
blessed
if
it
ain't
enough
to
make
an
old
pair
of
shoes
faint
away
why
you
infernal
scoundrel
said
the
admiral
nothing
of
the
sort
ever
happened
and
you
know
it
jack
you're
no
seaman--werry
good
said
jack
then
if
i
ain't
no
seaman
you
are
what
shore-going
people
calls
a
jolly
fat
old
humbug
jack
hold
your
tongue
said
henry
bannerworth
you
carry
these
things
too
far
you
know
very
well
that
your
master
esteems
you
and
you
should
not
presume
too
much
upon
that
fact--my
master
said
jack
don't
call
him
my
master
i
never
had
a
master
and
don't
intend
he's
my
admiral
if
you
like
but
an
english
sailor
don't
like
a
master
i
tell
you
what
it
is
jack
said
the
admiral
you've
got
your
good
qualities
i
admit--ay
ay
sir--that's
enough
you
may
as
well
leave
off
well
while
you
can
but
i'll
just
tell
you
what
you
resemble
more
than
anything
else--chew
me
up
what
may
that
be
sir
a
french
marine--a
what
a
french
marine
good-bye
i
wouldn't
say
another
word
to
you
if
you
was
to
pay
me
a
dollar
a
piece
of
all
the
blessed
insults
rolled
into
one
this
here's
the
worstest
you
might
have
called
me
a
marine
or
you
might
have
called
me
a
frenchman
but
to
make
out
that
i'm
both
a
marine
and
a
frenchman
d--me
if
it
isn't
enough
to
make
human
nature
stand
on
an
end
now
i've
done
with
you
and
a
good
job
too
said
the
admiral
i
wish
i'd
thought
of
it
before
you're
worse
than
a
third
day's
ague
or
a
hot
and
a
cold
fever
in
the
tropics--very
good
said
jack
i
only
hope
providence
will
have
mercy
upon
you
and
keep
an
eye
upon
you
when
i'm
gone
otherwise
i
wonder
what
will
become
of
you
it
wasn't
so
when
young
belinda
who
you
took
off
the
island
of
antiggy
in
the
ingies
jumped
overboard
and
i
went
after
her
in
a
heavy
swell
howsomdever
never
mind
you
shook
hands
with
me
then
and
while
a
bushel
of
the
briny
was
weeping
out
of
the
corner
of
each
of
your
blinkers
you
says
says
you--
hold
cried
the
admiral
hold
i
know
what
i
said
jack
it's
cut
a
fathom
deep
in
my
memory
give
us
your
fist
jack
and--and----hold
yourself
said
jack
i
know
what
you're
going
to
say
and
i
won't
hear
you
say
it--so
there's
an
end
of
it
lor
bless
you
i
knows
you
i
ain't
a
going
to
leave
you
don't
be
afraid
i
only
works
you
up
and
works
you
down
again
just
to
see
if
there's
any
of
that
old
spirit
in
you
when
we
was
aboard
the
victory
don't
you
recollect
admiral
yes--yes
enough
jack--why
let
me
see--that
was
a
matter
of
forty
years
ago
nearly
when
i
was
a
youngster
there--there
jack--that'll
do
you
bring
the
events
of
other
years
fresh
upon
my
memory
peace--peace
i
have
not
forgotten
but
still
to
hear
what
you
know
of
them
if
recited
would
give
the
old
man
a
pang--a
pang
said
jack
i
suppose
that's
some
dictionary
word
for
a
punch
in
the
eye
that
would
be
mutiny
with
a
vengeance
so
i'm
off
go
go--i'm
a
going
and
just
to
please
you
i'll
go
to
the
hall
so
you
sha'n't
say
that
you
told
me
to
do
anything
that
i
didn't
away
went
jack
whistling
an
air
that
might
have
been
popular
when
he
and
the
admiral
were
young
and
henry
bannerworth
could
not
but
remark
that
an
appearance
of
great
sadness
came
over
the
old
man
when
jack
was
gone
i
fear
sir
he
said
that
heedless
sailor
has
touched
upon
some
episode
in
your
existence
the
wounds
of
which
are
still
fresh
enough
to
give
you
pain--it
is
so
said
the
old
admiral
just
look
at
me
now
do
i
look
like
the
hero
of
a
romantic
love
story
not
exactly
i
admit--well
notwithstanding
that
jack
pringle
has
touched
a
chord
that
vibrates
in
my
heart
yet
replied
the
admiral
have
you
any
objection
to
tell
me
of
it--none
whatever
and
perhaps
by
the
time
i
have
done
the
doctor
may
have
found
his
way
back
again
or
jack
may
bring
us
some
news
of
him
so
here
goes
for
a
short
but
a
true
yarn
the
admiral's
story
of
the
beautiful
belinda
illustration
just
at
this
moment
flora
bannerworth
stole
into
the
room
from
whence
she
had
departed
a
short
time
since
but
when
she
saw
that
old
admiral
bell
was
looking
so
exceedingly
serious
and
apparently
about
to
address
henry
upon
some
very
important
subject
she
would
have
retired
but
he
turned
towards
her
and
said--
my
story
my
dear
i've
no
objection
to
your
hearing
and
like
all
women
folks
a
love
story
never
comes
amiss
to
you
so
you
may
as
well
stay
and
hear
it--a
love
story
said
flora
you
tell
a
love
story
sir
yes
my
dear
and
not
only
tell
it
but
be
the
hero
of
it
likewise
ain't
you
astonished--i
am
indeed
well
you'll
be
more
astonished
then
before
i've
done
so
just
listen
as
jack
pringle
says
it
was
the
matter
of
about
somewhere
forty
years
ago
that
i
was
in
command
of
the
victory
frigate
which
was
placed
upon
the
west
indian
station
during
a
war
then
raging
for
the
protection
of
our
ports
and
harbours
in
that
vicinity
we'd
not
a
strong
force
in
that
quarter
therefore
i
had
to
cut
about
from
place
to
place
and
do
the
best
i
could
after
a
time
though
i
rather
think
that
we
frightened
off
the
enemy
during
which
time
i
chiefly
anchored
off
the
island
of
antigua
and
was
hospitably
received
at
the
house
of
a
planter
of
the
name
of
marchant
who
in
fact
made
his
house
my
home
and
introduced
me
to
all
the
elite
of
the
society
of
the
island
ah
miss
flora
you've
no
idea
to
look
at
me
now
what
i
was
then
i
held
a
captain's
commission
and
was
nearly
the
youngest
man
in
the
service
with
such
a
rank
i
was
as
slender
ay
as
a
dancing
master
these
withered
and
bleached
locks
were
black
as
the
raven's
plume
ay
ay
but
no
matter
the
planter
had
a
daughter
and
you
loved
her
said
flora--loved
her
said
the
old
man
and
the
flush
of
youthful
animation
come
to
his
countenance
loved
her
do
you
say
i
adored
her
i
worshipped
her
she
was
to
me--but
what
a
d----d
old
fool
i
am
we'll
skip
that
if
you
please
nay
nay
said
flora
that
is
what
i
want
to
hear--i
haven't
the
least
doubt
of
that
in
the
world
but
that's
just
what
you
won't
hear
none
of
your
nonsense
miss
flora
the
old
man
may
be
a
fool
but
he
isn't
quite
an
idiot
he's
neither
said
flora
true
feelings
can
never
disgrace
any
one--perhaps
not
but
however
to
make
a
long
story
short
somehow
or
other
one
day
belinda
was
sitting
alone
and
i
rudely
pounced
upon
her
i
rather
think
then
i
must
have
said
something
that
i
oughtn't
to
have
said
for
it
took
her
so
aback
i
was
forced
somehow
or
other
to
hold
her
up
and
then
i--i--yes
i'm
sure
i
kissed
her
and
so
i
told
her
i
loved
her
and
then
what
do
you
think
she
said
why
said
flora
that
she
reciprocated
the
passion--d--n
my
rags
said
jack
who
at
the
moment
came
into
the
room
i
suppose
that's
the
name
of
some
shell
or
other
you
here
you
villain
said
the
admiral
i
thought
you
were
gone--so
i
was
said
jack
but
i
came
back
for
my
hat
you
see
away
he
went
again
and
the
admiral
resumed
his
story
well
miss
flora
he
said
you
haven't
made
a
good
guess
as
she
didn't
say
anything
at
all
she
only
clung
to
me
like
some
wild
bird
to
its
mother's
breast
and
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break--indeed
yes
i
didn't
know
the
cause
of
her
emotion
but
at
last
i
got
it
out
of
her--what
was
it
oh
a
mere
trifle
she
was
already
married
to
somebody
else
that's
all
some
d----d
fellow
who
had
gone
trading
about
the
islands
a
fellow
she
didn't
care
a
straw
about
that
was
old
enough
to
be
her
father
and
you
left
her--no
i
didn't
guess
again
i
was
a
mad-headed
youngster
i
only
felt--i
didn't
think
i
persuaded
her
to
come
away
with
me
i
took
her
aboard
my
ship
and
set
sail
with
her
a
few
weeks
flew
like
hours
but
one
day
we
were
hailed
by
a
vessel
and
when
we
neared
her
she
manned
a
boat
and
brought
a
letter
on
board
addressed
to
belinda
it
was
from
her
father
written
in
his
last
moments
it
began
with
a
curse
and
ended
with
a
blessing
there
was
a
postscript
in
another
hand
to
say
the
old
man
died
of
grief
she
read
it
by
my
side
on
the
quarter-deck
it
dropped
from
her
grasp
and
she
plunged
into
the
sea
jack
pringle
went
after
her
but
i
never
saw
her
again
gracious
heavens
what
a
tragedy--yes
tolerable
said
the
old
man
he
arose
and
took
his
hat
and
placed
it
on
his
head
he
gave
the
crown
of
it
a
blow
that
sent
it
nearly
over
his
eyes
he
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
his
breeches
pockets
clenched
his
teeth
and
muttered
something
inaudible
as
he
strode
from
the
apartment
who
would
have
thought
henry
said
flora
that
such
a
man
as
admiral
bell
had
been
the
hero
of
such
an
adventure--ay
who
indeed
but
it
shows
that
we
never
can
judge
from
appearances
flora
and
that
those
who
seem
to
us
the
most
heart-whole
may
have
experienced
the
wildest
vicissitudes
of
passion
and
we
must
remember
likewise
that
this
was
forty
years
ago
henry
which
makes
a
material
difference
in
the
state
of
the
case
as
regards
admiral
bell
it
does
indeed--more
than
half
a
lifetime
and
yet
how
evident
it
was
that
his
old
feelings
clung
to
him
i
can
well
imagine
the
many
hours
of
bitter
regret
which
the
memory
of
this
his
lost
love
must
have
given
him
true--true
i
can
feel
something
for
him
for
have
i
not
lost
one
who
loved
me--a
worse
loss
too
than
that
which
admiral
bell
relates
for
am
i
not
a
prey
to
all
the
horrors
of
uncertainty
whereas
he
knew
the
worst
and
that
at
all
events
death
had
claimed
its
victim
leaving
nothing
to
conjecture
in
the
shape
of
suffering
so
that
the
mind
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
recover
slowly
but
surely
as
it
would
from
the
shock
which
it
had
received
that
is
worse
than
you
flora
but
rather
would
i
have
you
cherish
hope
of
soon
beholding
charles
holland
probably
alive
and
well
than
fancy
any
great
disaster
has
come
over
him
i
will
endeavour
to
do
so
replied
flora
i
long
to
hear
what
has
become
of
dr
chillingworth
his
disappearance
is
most
singular
for
i
fully
suspected
that
he
had
some
particular
object
in
view
in
getting
possession
for
a
short
time
of
bannerworth
hall
but
now
from
jack
pringle's
account
he
appears
not
to
be
in
it
and
in
fact
to
have
disappeared
completely
from
the
sight
of
all
who
knew
him
yes
said
flora
but
he
may
have
done
that
brother
still
in
furtherance
of
his
object
it
may
be
so
and
i
will
hope
that
it
is
so
keep
yourself
close
sister
and
see
no
one
while
i
proceed
to
his
house
to
inquire
if
they
have
heard
anything
of
him
i
will
return
soon
be
assured
and
in
the
meantime
should
you
see
my
brother
tell
him
i
shall
be
at
home
in
an
hour
or
so
and
not
to
leave
the
cottage
for
it
is
more
than
likely
that
the
admiral
has
gone
to
bannerworth
hall
so
that
you
may
not
see
anything
of
him
for
some
time
marchdale's
attempted
villany
and
the
result
illustration
varney
the
vampyre
left
the
dungeon
of
charles
holland
amid
the
grey
ruins
with
a
perfect
confidence
the
young
man
would
keep
his
word
and
not
attempt
to
escape
from
that
place
until
the
time
had
elapsed
which
he
had
dictated
to
him
and
well
might
he
have
that
confidence
for
having
once
given
his
word
that
he
would
remain
until
he
heard
the
clock
strike
two
from
a
neighbouring
church
charles
holland
never
dreamt
for
a
moment
of
breaking
it
to
be
sure
it
was
a
weary
time
to
wait
when
liberty
appeared
before
him
but
he
was
the
soul
of
honour
and
the
least
likely
man
in
all
the
world
to
infringe
in
the
slightest
upon
the
condition
which
he
had
of
his
own
free
will
acceded
to
sir
francis
varney
walked
rapidly
until
he
came
nearly
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
then
he
slackened
his
pace
proceeding
more
cautiously
and
looking
carefully
about
him
as
if
he
feared
to
meet
any
one
who
might
recognise
him
he
had
not
proceeded
far
in
this
manner
when
he
became
conscious
of
the
cautious
figure
of
a
man
gliding
along
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
which
he
was
taking
a
suspicion
struck
him
from
the
general
appearance
that
it
was
marchdale
and
if
so
he
wondered
to
see
him
abroad
at
such
a
time
still
he
would
not
be
quite
certain
but
he
hurried
forward
so
as
to
meet
the
advancing
figure
and
then
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
and
marchdale
with
some
confusion
in
his
looks
and
manners
accosted
him
ah
sir
francis
varney
he
said
you
are
out
late--
why
you
know
i
should
be
out
late
said
varney
and
you
likewise
know
the
errand
upon
which
i
was
to
be
out
oh
i
recollect
you
were
to
release
your
prisoner--
yes
i
was
and
have
you
done
so--
oh
no
oh
indeed
i--i
am
glad
you
have
taken
better
thoughts
of
it
good
night--good
night
we
shall
meet
to-morrow--
adieu
said
sir
francis
varney
and
he
watched
the
retreating
figure
of
marchdale
and
then
he
added
in
a
low
tone
to
himself--
i
know
his
object
well
his
craven
spirit
shrinks
at
the
notion
a
probable
enough
one
i
will
admit
that
charles
holland
has
recognised
him
and
that
if
once
free
he
would
denounce
him
to
the
bannerworths
holding
him
up
to
scorn
in
his
true
colours
and
bringing
down
upon
his
head
perhaps
something
more
than
detestation
and
contempt
the
villain
he
is
going
now
to
take
the
life
of
the
man
whom
he
considers
chained
to
the
ground
well
well
they
must
fight
it
out
together
charles
holland
is
sufficiently
free
to
take
his
own
part
although
marchdale
little
thinks
that
such
is
the
case
marchdale
walked
on
for
some
little
distance
and
then
he
turned
and
looked
after
sir
francis
varney
indeed
he
said
so
you
have
not
released
him
to-night
but
i
know
well
will
do
so
soon
i
do
not
for
my
part
admire
this
romantic
generosity
which
sets
a
fox
free
at
the
moment
that
he's
the
most
dangerous
it's
all
very
well
to
be
generous
but
it
is
better
to
be
just
first
and
that
i
consider
means
looking
after
one's
self
first
i
have
a
poniard
here
which
will
soon
put
an
end
to
the
troubles
of
the
prisoner
in
his
dungeon--its
edge
is
keen
and
sharp
and
will
readily
find
a
way
to
his
heart
he
walked
on
quite
exultingly
and
carelessly
now
for
he
had
got
into
the
open
country
and
it
was
extremely
unlikely
that
he
would
meet
anybody
on
his
road
to
the
ruins
it
did
not
take
many
minutes
sharp
walking
now
to
bring
him
close
to
the
spot
which
he
intended
should
become
such
a
scene
of
treacherous
slaughter
and
just
then
he
heard
from
afar
off
something
like
the
muttering
of
thunder
as
if
heaven
itself
was
proclaiming
its
vengeance
against
the
man
who
had
come
out
to
slay
one
of
its
best
and
noblest
creatures
what
is
that'
said
marchdale
shrinking
back
a
moment
what
is
that--an
approaching
storm
it
must
be
so
for
now
i
recollect
me
the
sun
set
behind
a
bank
of
clouds
of
a
fiery
redness
and
as
the
evening
drew
in
there
was
every
appearance
in
the
heavens
of
some
ensuing
strife
of
the
elements
he
listened
for
a
few
moments
and
fixed
his
eyes
intently
in
the
direction
of
the
horizon
from
where
the
muttering
sounds
had
proceeded
he
had
not
long
to
wait
before
he
saw
a
bright
flash
of
blue
lightning
which
for
one
instant
illumined
the
sky
then
by
the
time
he
could
have
counted
twelve
there
came
the
thunder
which
the
flash
preceded
and
he
felt
terribly
anxious
to
complete
his
enterprize
so
that
he
might
get
back
to
the
town
and
be
safely
housed
before
the
storm
which
was
evidently
approaching
should
burst
upon
him
it
is
sweeping
on
apace
he
said
why
did
i
not
come
earlier
even
as
he
spoke
he
plunged
among
the
recesses
of
the
ruins
and
searching
about
for
the
old
stone
which
covered
the
entrance
to
the
dungeon
he
was
surprised
to
find
it
rolled
from
its
place
and
the
aperture
open
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
said
how
negligent
of
sir
francis
varney
or
perhaps
after
all
he
was
only
jesting
with
me
and
let
the
prisoner
go
if
that
should
be
the
case
i
am
foiled
indeed
but
surely
he
could
not
be
so
full
of
indiscretion
again
came
a
dazzling
flash
of
lightning
which
now
surrounded
by
the
ruins
as
he
was
made
him
shrink
back
and
cover
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
then
followed
a
peal
of
thunder
with
not
half
the
duration
of
time
between
it
and
the
flash
which
had
characterized
the
previous
electric
phenomenon
the
storm
approaches
fast
said
marchdale
i
must
get
my
work
done
quickly
if
indeed
my
victim
be
here
which
i
begin
seriously
to
doubt
he
descended
the
intricate
winding
passage
to
the
vault
below
which
served
the
purpose
of
a
dungeon
and
when
he
got
very
nearly
into
the
depth
of
its
recesses
he
called
aloud
saying--
ho
what
ho
is
there
any
one
here--yes
said
charles
holland
who
fancied
it
might
be
his
former
visitor
returned
have
you
come
to
repent
of
your
purpose
ah
said
marchdale
to
himself
sir
francis
after
all
has
told
me
the
truth--the
prisoner
is
still
here
the
light
from
without
was
not
near
sufficient
to
send
the
least
ray
into
the
depths
of
that
dungeon
so
that
marchdale
when
he
entered
the
place
could
see
nothing
but
an
absolute
blackness
it
was
not
so
however
with
charles
holland
whose
eyes
had
been
now
so
long
accustomed
to
the
place
that
he
could
see
in
it
as
if
a
dim
twilight
irradiated
it
and
he
at
once
in
his
visitor
saw
his
worst
foe
and
not
the
man
who
had
comparatively
set
him
free
he
saw
too
that
the
hand
of
his
visitor
grasped
a
weapon
which
marchdale
thought
that
favoured
by
the
darkness
he
might
carry
openly
in
perfect
security
where
are
you
said
marchdale
i
cannot
see
you--here
said
charles
you
may
feel
my
grip
and
he
sprung
upon
him
in
an
instant
the
attack
was
so
sudden
and
so
utterly
unexpected
that
marchdale
was
thrown
backwards
and
the
dagger
wrested
from
his
grasp
during
the
first
impulse
which
charles
holland
had
thrown
into
his
attack
moreover
his
head
struck
with
such
violence
against
the
earthern
floor
that
it
produced
a
temporary
confusion
of
his
faculties
so
that
had
charles
holland
been
so
inclined
he
might
with
marchdale's
own
weapon
have
easily
taken
his
life
the
young
man
did
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
raise
it
in
his
hand
but
on
the
impulse
of
another
thought
he
cast
it
from
him
exclaiming--
no
no
not
that
i
should
be
as
bad
as
he
or
nearly
so
this
villain
has
come
to
murder
me
but
yet
i
will
not
take
his
life
for
the
deed
what
shall
i
do
with
him
ha
a
lucky
thought--chains
he
dragged
marchdale
to
the
identical
spot
of
earth
on
which
he
had
lain
so
long
and
as
sir
francis
varney
had
left
the
key
of
the
padlock
which
bound
the
chains
together
in
it
he
in
a
few
moments
had
succeeded
in
placing
the
villain
marchdale
in
the
same
durance
from
which
he
had
himself
shortly
since
escaped
remain
there
he
said
until
some
one
comes
to
rescue
you
i
will
not
let
you
starve
to
death
but
i
will
give
you
a
long
fast
and
when
i
come
again
it
shall
be
along
with
some
of
the
bannerworth
family
to
show
them
what
a
viper
they
have
fostered
in
their
hearts
marchdale
was
just
sufficiently
conscious
now
to
feel
all
the
realities
of
his
situation
in
vain
he
attempted
to
rise
from
his
prostrate
position
the
chains
did
their
duty
keeping
down
a
villain
with
the
same
means
that
they
had
held
in
ignominious
confinement
a
true
man
he
was
in
a
perfect
agony
inasmuch
as
he
considered
that
he
would
be
allowed
to
remain
there
to
starve
to
death
thus
achieving
for
himself
a
more
horrible
death
than
any
he
had
ever
thought
of
inflicting
villain
exclaimed
charles
holland
you
shall
there
remain
and
let
you
have
what
mental
sufferings
you
may
you
richly
deserve
them
he
heeded
not
the
cries
of
marchdale--he
heeded
not
his
imprecations
any
more
than
he
did
his
prayers
and
the
arch
hypocrite
used
both
in
abundance
charles
was
but
too
happy
once
more
to
look
upon
the
open
sky
although
it
was
then
in
darkness
to
heed
anything
that
marchdale
in
the
agony
to
which
he
was
now
reduced
might
feel
inclined
to
say
and
after
glancing
around
him
for
some
few
moments
when
he
was
free
of
the
ruins
and
inhaling
with
exquisite
delight
the
free
air
of
the
surrounding
meadows
he
saw
by
the
twinkling
of
the
lights
in
which
direction
the
town
lay
and
knowing
that
by
taking
a
line
in
that
path
and
then
after
a
time
diverging
a
little
to
the
right
he
should
come
to
bannerworth
hall
he
walked
on
never
in
his
whole
life
probably
feeling
such
an
enjoyment
of
the
mere
fact
of
existence
as
at
such
a
moment
as
that
of
exquisite
liberty
our
readers
may
with
us
imagine
what
it
is
to
taste
the
free
fresh
air
of
heaven
after
being
long
pent
up
as
he
charles
holland
had
been
in
a
damp
noisome
dungeon
teeming
with
unwholesome
exhalations
they
may
well
suppose
with
what
an
amount
of
rapture
he
now
found
himself
unrestrained
in
his
movements
by
those
galling
fetters
which
had
hung
for
so
long
a
period
upon
his
youthful
limbs
and
which
not
unfrequently
in
the
despair
of
his
heart
he
had
thought
he
should
surely
die
in
and
last
although
not
least
in
his
dear
esteem
did
the
rapturous
thought
of
once
more
looking
in
the
sweet
face
of
her
he
loved
come
cross
him
with
a
gush
of
delight
yes
he
exclaimed
as
he
quickened
his
pace
yes
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
flora
bannerworth
how
well
and
how
truly
i
love
her
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
her
that
in
my
weary
and
hideous
imprisonment
the
thought
alone
of
her
has
supported
me
as
he
neared
the
hall
he
quickened
his
pace
to
such
an
extent
that
soon
he
was
forced
to
pause
altogether
as
the
exertion
he
had
undertaken
pretty
plainly
told
him
that
the
imprisonment
scanty
diet
and
want
of
exercise
which
had
been
his
portion
for
some
time
past
had
most
materially
decreased
his
strength
his
limbs
trembled
and
a
profuse
perspiration
bedewed
his
brow
although
the
night
was
rather
cold
than
otherwise
i
am
very
weak
he
said
and
much
i
wonder
now
that
i
succeeded
in
overcoming
that
villain
marchdale
who
if
i
had
not
done
so
would
most
assuredly
have
murdered
me
and
it
was
a
wonder
for
marchdale
was
not
an
old
man
although
he
might
be
considered
certainly
as
past
the
prime
of
life
and
he
was
of
a
strong
and
athletic
build
but
it
was
the
suddenness
of
his
attack
upon
him
which
had
given
charles
holland
the
great
advantage
and
had
caused
the
defeat
of
the
ruffian
who
came
bent
on
one
of
the
most
cowardly
and
dastardly
murders
that
could
be
committed--namely
upon
an
unoffending
man
whom
he
supposed
to
be
loaded
with
chains
and
incapable
of
making
the
least
efficient
resistance
charles
soon
again
recovered
sufficient
breath
and
strength
to
proceed
towards
the
hall
and
now
warned
by
the
exhaustion
which
had
come
over
him
that
he
had
not
really
anything
like
strength
enough
to
allow
him
to
proceed
rapidly
he
walked
with
slow
and
deliberate
steps
this
mode
of
proceeding
was
more
favourable
to
reflection
than
the
wild
rapid
one
which
he
had
at
first
adopted
and
in
all
the
glowing
colours
of
youthful
and
ingenious
fancy
did
he
depict
to
himself
the
surprise
and
the
pleasure
that
would
beam
in
the
countenance
of
his
beloved
flora
when
she
should
find
him
once
again
by
her
side
of
course
he
charles
could
know
nothing
of
the
contrivances
which
had
been
resorted
to
and
which
the
reader
may
lay
wholly
to
the
charge
of
marchdale
to
blacken
his
character
and
to
make
him
appear
faithless
to
the
love
he
had
professed
had
he
known
this
it
is
probable
that
indignation
would
have
added
wings
to
his
progress
and
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
proceed
at
the
leisurely
pace
he
felt
that
his
state
of
physical
weakness
dictated
to
him
and
now
he
saw
the
topmost
portion
at
bannerworth
hall
pushing
out
from
amongst
the
trees
with
which
the
ancient
pile
was
so
much
surrounded
and
the
sight
of
the
home
of
his
beloved
revived
him
and
quickened
the
circulation
of
the
warm
blood
in
his
veins
i
shall
behold
her
now
he
said--i
shall
behold
her
how
a
few
minutes
more
and
i
shall
hold
her
to
my
heart--that
heart
which
has
been
ever
hers
and
which
carried
her
image
enshrined
in
its
deepest
recesses
even
into
the
gloom
of
a
dungeon
but
let
us
while
charles
holland
is
indulging
in
these
delightful
anticipations--anticipations
which
we
regret
in
consequence
of
the
departure
of
the
bannerworths
from
the
hall
will
not
be
realized
so
soon
as
he
supposes--look
back
upon
the
discomfited
hypocrite
and
villain
marchdale
who
occupies
his
place
in
the
dungeon
of
the
old
ruins
until
charles
holland
actually
had
left
the
strange
horrible
and
cell-like
place
he
could
scarcely
make
up
his
mind
that
the
young
man
entertained
a
serious
intention
of
leaving
him
there
perhaps
he
did
not
think
any
one
could
be
so
cruel
and
so
wicked
as
he
himself
for
the
reader
will
no
doubt
recollect
that
his
marchdale's
counsel
to
varney
was
to
leave
charles
holland
to
his
fate
chained
down
as
he
was
in
the
dungeon
and
that
fate
would
have
been
the
horrible
one
of
being
starved
to
death
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
when
now
however
he
felt
confident
that
he
was
deserted--when
he
heard
the
sound
of
charles
holland's
retreating
footsteps
slowly
dying
away
in
the
distance
until
not
the
faintest
echo
of
them
reached
his
ears
he
despaired
indeed
and
the
horror
he
experienced
during
the
succeeding
ten
minutes
might
be
considered
an
ample
atonement
for
some
of
his
crimes
his
brain
was
in
a
complete
whirl
nothing
of
a
tangible
nature
but
that
he
was
there
chained
down
and
left
to
starve
to
death
came
across
his
intellect
then
a
kind
of
madness
for
a
moment
or
two
took
possession
of
him
he
made
a
tremendous
effort
to
burst
asunder
the
bands
that
held
him
but
it
was
in
vain
the
chains--which
had
been
placed
upon
charles
holland
during
the
first
few
days
of
his
confinement
when
he
had
a
little
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
violence
which
had
been
committed
upon
him
at
the
time
when
he
was
captured--effectually
resisted
marchdale
they
even
cut
into
his
flesh
inflicting
upon
him
some
grievous
wounds
but
that
was
all
he
achieved
by
his
great
efforts
to
free
himself
so
that
after
a
few
moments
bleeding
and
in
great
pain
he
with
a
deep
groan
desisted
from
the
fruitless
efforts
he
had
better
not
have
commenced
then
he
remained
silent
for
a
time
but
it
was
not
the
silence
of
reflection
it
was
that
of
exhaustion
and
as
such
was
not
likely
to
last
long
nor
did
it
for
in
the
course
of
another
five
minutes
he
called
out
loudly
perhaps
he
thought
there
might
be
a
remote
chance
that
some
one
traversing
the
meadows
would
hear
him
and
yet
if
he
had
duly
considered
the
matter
which
he
was
not
in
a
fitting
frame
of
mind
to
do
he
would
have
recollected
that
in
choosing
a
dungeon
among
the
underground
vaults
of
these
ruins
he
had
by
experiment
made
certain
that
no
cry
however
loud
from
where
he
lay
could
reach
the
upper
air
and
thus
had
this
villain
by
the
very
precautions
which
he
had
himself
taken
to
ensure
the
safe
custody
of
another
been
his
own
greatest
enemy
help
help
help
he
cried
frantically
varney
charles
holland
have
mercy
upon
me
and
do
not
leave
me
here
to
starve
help
oh
heaven
curses
on
all
your
heads--curses
oh
mercy--mercy--mercy
in
suchlike
incoherent
expressions
did
he
pass
some
hours
until
what
with
exhaustion
and
a
raging
thirst
that
came
over
him
he
could
not
utter
another
word
but
lay
the
very
picture
of
despair
and
discomfited
malice
and
wickedness
flora
bannerworth
and
her
mother--the
episode
of
chivalry
illustration
gladly
we
turn
from
such
a
man
as
marchdale
to
a
consideration
of
the
beautiful
and
accomplished
flora
bannerworth
to
whom
we
may
without
destroying
in
any
way
the
interest
of
our
plot
predict
a
much
happier
destiny
than
probably
at
that
time
she
considers
as
at
all
likely
to
be
hers
she
certainly
enjoyed
upon
her
first
removal
from
bannerworth
hall
greater
serenity
of
mind
than
she
had
done
there
but
as
we
have
already
remarked
of
her
the
more
her
mind
was
withdrawn
by
change
of
scene
from
the
horrible
considerations
which
the
attack
of
the
vampyre
had
forced
upon
her
the
more
she
reverted
to
the
fate
of
charles
holland
which
was
still
shrouded
in
so
much
gloom
she
would
sit
and
converse
with
her
mother
upon
that
subject
until
she
worked
up
her
feelings
to
a
most
uncomfortable
pitch
of
excitement
and
then
mrs
bannerworth
would
get
her
younger
brother
to
join
them
who
would
occasionally
read
to
her
some
compositions
of
his
own
or
of
some
favourite
writer
whom
he
thought
would
amuse
her
illustration
it
was
on
the
very
evening
when
sir
francis
varney
had
made
up
his
mind
to
release
charles
holland
that
young
bannerworth
read
to
his
sister
and
his
mother
the
following
little
chivalric
incident
which
he
told
them
he
had
himself
collated
from
authentic
sources--
the
knight
with
the
green
shield
exclaimed
one
of
a
party
of
men-at-arms
who
were
drinking
together
at
an
ancient
hostel
not
far
from
shrewsbury--the
knight
with
the
green
shield
is
as
good
a
knight
as
ever
buckled
on
a
sword
or
wore
spurs--then
how
comes
it
he
is
not
one
of
the
victors
in
the
day's
tournament
exclaimed
another--by
the
bones
of
alfred
said
a
third
a
man
must
be
judged
of
by
his
deserts
and
not
by
the
partiality
of
his
friends
that's
my
opinion
friends--and
mine
too
said
another
that
is
all
very
true
and
my
opinion
would
go
with
yours
too
but
not
in
this
instance
though
you
may
accuse
me
of
partiality
yet
i
am
not
so
for
i
have
seen
some
of
the
victors
of
to-day
by
no
means
forward
in
the
press
of
battle-men
who
i
will
not
say
feared
danger
but
who
liked
it
not
so
well
but
they
avoided
it
as
much
as
possible
ay
marry
and
so
have
i
the
reason
is
'tis
much
easier
to
face
a
blunted
lance
than
one
with
a
spear-head
and
a
man
may
practise
the
one
and
thrive
in
it
but
not
the
other
for
the
best
lance
in
the
tournament
is
not
always
the
best
arm
in
the
battle
and
that
is
the
reason
of
my
saying
the
knight
with
the
green
shield
was
a
good
knight
i
have
seen
him
in
the
midst
of
the
melee
when
men
and
horses
have
been
hurled
to
the
ground
by
the
shock
there
he
has
behaved
himself
like
a
brave
knight
and
has
more
than
once
been
noticed
for
it
but
how
canne
he
to
be
so
easily
overthrown
to-day
that
speaks
something--his
horse
is
an
old
one
so
much
the
better
said
another
he's
used
to
his
work
and
as
cunning
as
an
old
man--but
he
has
been
wounded
more
than
once
and
is
weakened
very
much
besides
i
saw
him
lose
his
footing
else
he
had
overthrown
his
opponent
he
did
not
seem
distressed
about
his
accident
at
all
events
but
sat
contented
in
the
tent--he
knows
well
that
those
who
know
him
will
never
attribute
his
misadventure
either
to
want
of
courage
or
conduct
moreover
he
seems
to
be
one
of
those
who
care
but
little
for
the
opinion
of
men
who
care
nothing
for
him
and
he's
right
well
dear
comrades
the
health
of
green
knight
or
the
knight
with
a
green
shield
for
that's
his
name
or
the
designation
he
chooses
to
go
by--a
health
to
the
knight
with
the
green
shield
shouted
the
men-at-arms
as
they
lifted
their
cups
on
high
who
is
he
inquired
one
of
the
men-at-arms
of
him
who
had
spoken
favourably
of
the
stranger--i
don't
know
and
yet
you
spoke
favourably
of
him
a
few
seconds
back
and
said
what
a
brave
knight
he
was--and
so
i
uphold
him
to
be
but
i
tell
you
what
friend
i
would
do
as
much
for
the
greatest
stranger
i
ever
met
i
have
seen
him
fight
where
men
and
horses
have
bit
the
dust
in
hundreds
and
that
in
my
opinion
speaks
out
for
the
man
and
warrior
he
who
cannot
then
fight
like
a
soldier
had
better
tilt
at
home
in
the
castle-yard
and
there
win
ladies'
smiles
but
not
the
commendation
of
the
leader
of
the
battle
that's
true
i
myself
recollect
very
well
sir
hugh
de
colbert
a
very
accomplished
knight
in
the
castle-yard
but
his
men
were
as
fine
a
set
of
fellows
as
ever
crossed
a
horse
to
look
at
but
they
proved
deficient
at
the
moment
of
trial
they
were
broken
and
fled
in
a
moment
and
scarce
one
of
them
received
a
scratch
then
they
hadn't
stood
the
shock
of
the
foeman--no
that's
certain
but
still
i
should
like
to
know
the
knight--to
know
his
name
very
well--i
know
it
not
he
has
some
reason
for
keeping
it
secret
i
suppose
but
his
deeds
will
not
shame
it
be
it
what
it
may
i
can
bear
witness
to
more
than
one
foeman
falling
beneath
his
battle-axe
indeed--yes
and
he
took
a
banner
from
the
enemy
in
the
last
battle
that
was
fought
ah
well
he
deserves
a
better
fortune
to-morrow
who
is
to
be
the
bridegroom
of
the
beautiful
bertha
daughter
of
lord
de
cauci--that
will
have
to
be
decided
but
it
is
presumed
that
sir
guthrie
de
beaumont
is
the
intended
ah
but
should
he
not
prove
the
victor--it's
understood
because
it's
known
he
is
intended
by
the
parents
of
the
lady
and
none
would
be
ungallant
enough
to
prevail
against
him--save
on
such
conditions
as
would
not
endanger
the
fruits
of
victory
no--certainly
not
they
would
lay
the
trophies
at
the
foot
of
the
beauty
worshipped
by
the
knights
at
the
tournament
so
triumphant
or
not
he's
to
be
the
bridegroom
bearing
off
the
prize
of
valour
whether
or
no--in
fact
deserve
her
or
not--that's
the
fact--so
it
is
so
it
is
and
a
shame
too
friends
but
so
it
is
now
but
yet
if
the
knight's
horse
recovers
from
the
strain
and
is
fit
for
work
to-morrow
it
strikes
me
that
the
green
shield
will
give
some
work
to
the
holiday
knight





there
had
been
a
grand
tournament
held
near
shrewsbury
castle
in
honour
of
the
intended
nuptials
of
the
beautiful
lady
bertha
de
cauci
she
was
the
only
daughter
of
the
earl
de
cauci
a
nobleman
of
some
note
he
was
one
of
an
ancient
and
unblemished
name
and
of
great
riches
the
lady
was
beautiful
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
an
unwilling
bride--every
one
could
see
that
but
the
bridegroom
cared
not
for
that
there
was
a
sealed
sorrow
on
her
brow--a
sorrow
that
seemed
sincere
and
lasting
but
she
spoke
not
of
it
to
any
one--her
lips
were
seldom
parted
she
loved
another
yes
she
loved
one
who
was
far
away
fighting
in
the
wars
of
his
country--one
who
was
not
so
rich
in
lands
as
her
present
bridegroom
when
he
left
her
she
remembered
his
promise
it
was
to
fight
on
till
he
earned
a
fortune
or
name
that
should
give
him
some
right
to
claim
her
hand
even
from
her
imperious
father
but
alas
he
came
not
and
what
could
she
do
against
the
commands
of
one
who
would
be
obeyed
her
mother
too
was
a
proud
haughty
woman
one
whose
sole
anxiety
was
to
increase
the
grandeur
and
power
of
her
house
by
such
connections
thus
it
was
pressed
on
by
circumstances
she
could
no
longer
hold
out
more
especially
as
she
heard
nothing
of
her
knight
she
knew
not
where
he
was
or
indeed
if
he
were
living
or
dead
she
knew
not
he
was
never
named
this
last
circumstance
indeed
gave
her
pain
for
it
assured
her
that
he
whom
she
loved
had
been
unable
to
signalize
himself
from
among
other
men
that
in
fact
he
was
unknown
in
the
annals
of
fame
as
well
as
the
probability
that
he
had
been
slain
in
some
of
the
earlier
skirmishes
of
the
war
this
if
it
had
happened
caused
her
some
pain
to
think
upon
not
but
such
events
were
looked
upon
with
almost
indifference
by
females
save
in
such
cases
where
their
affections
were
engaged
as
on
this
occasion
but
the
event
was
softened
by
the
fact
that
men
were
continually
falling
by
the
hand
of
man
in
such
encounters
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
considered
an
honourable
and
praiseworthy
death
for
a
soldier
he
was
wounded
but
not
with
the
anguish
we
now
hear
of
for
the
friends
were
consoled
by
the
reflection
that
the
deceased
warrior
died
covered
with
glory
bertha
however
was
young
and
as
yet
she
knew
not
the
cause
of
her
absent
knight's
silence
or
why
he
had
not
been
heard
of
among
the
most
forward
in
the
battle
heaven's
will
be
done
she
exclaimed
what
can
i
do
i
must
submit
to
my
father's
behests
but
my
future
life
will
be
one
of
misery
and
sorrow
she
wept
to
think
of
the
past
and
to
dream
of
the
future
both
alike
were
sorrowful
to
think
upon--no
comfort
in
the
past
and
no
joy
in
the
future
thus
she
wept
and
sorrowed
on
the
night
of
the
first
tournament
there
was
to
be
a
second
and
that
was
to
be
the
grand
one
where
her
intended
bridegroom
was
to
show
himself
off
in
her
eyes
and
take
his
part
in
the
sport





bertha
sat
late--she
sat
sorrowing
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
and
the
flickering
flame
of
the
fire
as
it
rose
and
fell
on
the
hearth
and
threw
dancing
shadows
on
the
walls
oh
why
arthur
home
should
you
thus
be
absent
absent
too
at
such
a
time
when
you
are
more
needed
than
ever
alas
alas
you
may
no
longer
be
in
the
land
of
the
living
your
family
is
great
and
your
name
known--your
own
has
been
spoken
with
commendation
from
the
lips
of
your
friend
what
more
of
fame
do
you
need
but
i
am
speaking
without
purpose
heaven
have
mercy
on
me
as
she
spoke
she
looked
up
and
saw
one
of
her
women
in
waiting
standing
by
well
what
would
you--my
lady
there
is
one
who
would
speak
with
you
said
the
hand-maiden
with
me--yes
my
lady
he
named
you
the
lady
bertha
de
cauci
who
and
what
is
he
she
inquired
with
something
like
trepidation
of
the
maiden--i
know
not
my
lady
but
gave
he
not
some
token
by
which
i
might
know
who
i
admit
to
my
chamber--none
replied
the
maiden
and
what
does
he
bear
by
way
of
distinguishing
himself
what
crest
or
device
doth
he
bear--merely
a
green
shield
the
unsuccessful
knight
in
the
tournament
to-day
heaven's
what
can
he
desire
with
me
he
is
not--no
no
it
cannot
be--it
cannot
be--will
you
admit
him
lady
indeed
i
know
not
what
to
do
but
yet
he
may
have
some
intelligence
to
give
me
yes
yes
admit
him
but
first
throw
some
logs
on
the
fire
the
attendant
did
as
she
was
desired
and
then
quitted
the
room
for
the
purpose
of
admitting
the
stranger
knight
with
the
green
shield
in
a
few
moments
she
could
hear
the
stride
of
the
knight
as
he
entered
the
apartment
and
she
thought
the
step
was
familiar
to
her
ear--she
thought
it
was
the
step
of
sir
arthur
home
her
lover
she
waited
anxiously
to
see
the
door
open
and
then
the
stranger
entered
his
form
and
bearing
was
that
of
her
lover
but
his
visor
was
down
and
she
was
unable
to
distinguish
the
features
of
the
stranger
his
armour
was
such
as
had
seen
many
a
day's
hard
wear
and
there
were
plenty
of
marks
of
the
battle
about
him
his
travel-worn
accoutrements
were
altogether
such
as
bespoke
service
in
the
field
sir
you
desired
to
see
me
say
wherefore
you
do
so
and
if
it
is
news
you
bring
the
knight
answered
not
but
pointed
to
the
female
attendant
as
if
he
desired
she
would
withdraw
you
may
retire
said
bertha
be
within
call
and
let
me
know
if
i
am
threatened
with
interruption
the
attendant
retired
and
then
the
knight
and
lady
were
left
alone
the
former
seemed
at
a
loss
how
to
break
silence
for
some
moments
and
then
he
said--
lady
----
oh
heavens
'tis
he
exclaimed
bertha
as
she
sprang
to
her
feet
it
is
sir
arthur
home
it
is
exclaimed
the
knight
pulling
up
his
visor
and
dropping
on
one
knee
he
encircled
his
arm
round
the
waist
of
the
lady
and
at
the
same
moment
he
pressed
her
lips
to
his
own
the
first
emotion
of
joy
and
surprise
over
bertha
checked
her
transports
and
chid
the
knight
for
his
boldness
nay
chide
me
not
dear
bertha
i
am
what
i
was
when
i
left
you
and
hope
to
find
you
the
same
am
i
not
said
bertha--truly
i
know
not
for
you
seem
more
beautiful
than
you
were
then
i
hope
that
is
the
only
change
if
there
be
a
change
it
is
only
such
as
you
see
sorrow
and
regret
form
the
principal
causes--i
understand
you
my
intended
nuptials
----
yes
i
have
heard
all
i
came
here
but
late
in
the
morning
and
my
horse
was
jaded
and
tired
and
my
impatience
to
attend
the
tournament
caused
me
a
disaster
which
it
is
well
it
came
not
on
the
second
day
it
is
dear
arthur
how
is
it
i
never
heard
your
name
mentioned
or
that
i
received
no
news
from
any
one
about
you
during
the
wars
that
have
ended--i
had
more
than
one
personal
enemy
bertha
men
who
would
have
been
glad
to
see
me
fall
and
who
in
default
of
that
would
not
have
minded
bribing
an
assassin
to
secure
my
death
for
them
at
any
risk
whatever
heavens
and
how
did
you
escape
such
a
death
from
such
people
arthur--by
adopting
such
a
device
as
that
i
wear
the
knight
of
the
green
shield
i'm
called
i
saw
you
to-day
in
the
tournament--and
there
my
tired
and
jaded
horse
gave
way
but
to-morrow
i
shall
have
i
hope
a
different
fortune
i
hope
so
too--i
will
try
my
arm
has
been
good
in
battle
and
i
see
not
why
it
should
be
deficient
in
peaceful
jousts
certainly
not
what
fortune
have
you
met
with
since
you
left
england--i
was
of
course
known
but
to
a
few
among
those
few
were
the
general
under
whom
i
served
and
my
more
immediate
officers
who
i
knew
would
not
divulge
my
secret
and
they
did
not--no
kept
it
nobly
and
kept
their
eyes
upon
me
in
battle
and
i
have
reaped
a
rich
harvest
in
force
honour
and
riches
i
assure
you
thank
heaven
said
bertha--bertha
if
i
be
conqueror
may
i
claim
you
in
the
court-yard
before
all
the
spectators
you
may
said
bertha
and
she
hung
her
head--moreover
said
sir
arthur
you
will
not
make
a
half
promise
but
when
i
demand
you
you
will
at
once
come
down
to
me
and
accept
me
as
your
husband
if
i
be
the
victor
then
he
cannot
object
to
the
match
but
he
will
have
many
friends
and
his
intended
bride
will
have
many
more
so
that
you
may
run
some
danger
among
so
many
enemies--never
fear
for
me
bertha
because
i
shall
have
many
friends
of
distinction
there
too--many
old
friends
who
are
tried
men
in
battle
and
whose
deeds
are
a
glory
and
honour
to
them
besides
i
shall
have
my
commander
and
several
gentlemen
who
would
at
once
interfere
in
case
any
unfair
advantage
was
attempted
to
be
taken
of
my
supposed
weakness
have
you
a
fresh
horse
inquired
bertha--i
have
or
shall
have
by
the
morning
but
promise
me
you
will
do
what
i
ask
you
and
then
my
arm
will
be
nerved
to
its
utmost
and
i
am
sure
to
be
victorious
i
do
promise
said
bertha
i
hope
you
may
be
as
successful
as
you
hope
to
be
arthur
but
suppose
fortune
should
declare
against
you
suppose
an
accident
of
any
kind
were
to
happen
what
could
be
done
then--i
must
be
content
to
hide
myself
for
ever
afterwards
as
a
defeated
knight
how
can
i
appear
before
your
friends
as
the
claimant
of
your
hand
i
will
never
have
any
other--but
you
will
be
forced
to
accept
this
guthrie
de
beaumont
your
father's
chosen
son-in-law
i
will
seek
refuge
in
a
cloister--will
you
fly
with
me
bertha
to
some
sequestered
spot
where
we
can
live
in
each
others
society
yes
said
bertha
anything
save
marriage
with
guthrie
de
beaumont--then
await
the
tournament
of
to-morrow
said
sir
arthur
and
then
this
may
be
avoided
in
the
meantime
keep
up
a
good
heart
and
remember
i
am
at
hand





these
two
lovers
parted
for
the
present
after
a
protracted
interview
bertha
to
her
chamber
and
the
knight
of
the
green
shield
to
his
tent
the
following
morning
was
one
of
great
preparation
the
lists
had
been
enlarged
and
the
seats
made
more
commodious
for
the
influx
of
visitors
appeared
to
be
much
greater
than
had
been
anticipated
moreover
there
were
many
old
warriors
of
distinction
to
be
present
which
made
the
bridegroom
look
pale
and
feel
uncomfortable
as
to
the
results
of
the
tournament
the
tilting
was
to
begin
at
an
early
hour
and
then
the
feasting
and
revelry
would
begin
early
in
the
evening
after
the
tilting
had
all
passed
off
in
that
day's
work
there
were
many
thrown
from
their
saddles
and
many
broke
their
lances
the
bridegroom
tilted
with
several
knights
and
came
off
victorious
or
without
disadvantage
to
either
the
green
knight
on
the
contrary
tilted
with
but
few
and
always
victorious
and
such
matches
were
with
men
who
had
been
men
of
some
name
in
the
wars
or
at
least
in
the
tilt
yard
the
sports
drew
to
a
close
and
when
the
bridegroom
became
the
challenger
the
knight
of
the
green
shield
at
once
rode
out
quietly
to
meet
him
the
encounter
could
not
well
be
avoided
and
the
bridegroom
would
willingly
have
declined
the
joust
with
a
knight
who
had
disposed
of
his
enemies
so
easily
and
so
unceremoniously
as
he
had
the
first
encounter
was
enough
the
bridegroom
was
thrown
to
a
great
distance
and
lay
insensible
on
the
ground
and
was
carried
out
of
the
field
there
was
an
immediate
sensation
among
the
friends
of
the
bridegroom
several
of
whom
rode
out
to
challenge
the
stranger
knight
for
his
presumption
in
this
however
they
had
misreckoned
the
chances
for
the
challenged
accepted
their
challenges
with
alacrity
and
disposed
of
them
one
by
one
with
credit
to
himself
until
the
day
was
concluded
the
stranger
was
then
asked
to
declare
who
he
was
upon
which
he
lifted
his
visor
and
said
i
am
sir
arthur
home
and
claim
the
lady
bertha
as
my
bride
by
the
laws
of
arms
and
by
those
of
love





again
the
tent
was
felled
and
again
the
hostelry
was
tenanted
by
the
soldier
who
declared
for
one
side
and
then
for
the
other
as
the
cups
clanged
and
jingled
together
said
i
not
exclaimed
one
of
the
troopers
that
the
knight
with
a
green
shield
was
a
good
knight--you
did
replied
the
other
and
you
knew
who
he
was
said
another
of
the
troopers--not
i
comrades
i
had
seen
him
fight
in
battle
and
therefore
partly
guessed
how
it
would
be
if
he
had
any
chance
with
the
bridegroom
i'm
glad
he
has
won
the
lady
it
was
true
the
lady
bertha
was
won
and
sir
arthur
home
claimed
his
bride
and
then
they
attempted
to
defeat
his
claim
yet
bertha
at
once
expressed
herself
in
his
favour
to
strongly
that
they
were
however
reluctantly
compelled
to
consent
at
last
at
this
moment
a
loud
shout
as
from
a
multitude
of
persons
came
upon
their
ears
and
flora
started
from
her
seat
in
alarm
the
cause
of
the
alarm
we
shall
proceed
to
detail
the
funeral
of
the
stranger
of
the
inn--the
popular
commotion
and
mrs
chillingworth's
appeal
to
the
mob--the
new
riot--the
hall
in
danger
illustration
as
yet
the
town
was
quiet
and
though
there
was
no
appearance
of
riot
or
disturbance
yet
the
magistracy
had
taken
every
precaution
they
deemed
needful
or
their
position
and
necessities
warranted
to
secure
the
peace
of
the
town
from
the
like
disturbance
to
that
which
had
been
of
late
a
disgrace
and
terror
of
peaceably-disposed
persons
the
populace
were
well
advertised
of
the
fact
that
the
body
of
the
stranger
was
to
be
buried
that
morning
in
their
churchyard
and
that
to
protect
the
body
should
there
be
any
necessity
for
so
doing
a
large
body
of
constables
would
be
employed
there
was
no
disposition
to
riot
at
least
none
was
visible
it
looked
as
if
there
was
some
event
about
to
take
place
that
was
highly
interesting
to
all
parties
who
were
peaceably
assembling
to
witness
the
interment
of
nobody
knew
who
the
early
hour
at
which
persons
were
assembling
at
different
points
clearly
indicated
that
there
was
a
spirit
of
curiosity
about
the
town
so
uncommon
that
none
would
have
noticed
it
but
for
the
fact
of
the
crowd
of
people
who
hung
about
the
streets
and
there
remained
listless
and
impatient
the
inn
too
was
crowded
with
visitors
and
there
were
many
who
not
being
blessed
with
the
strength
of
purse
that
some
were
were
hanging
about
in
the
distance
waiting
and
watching
the
motions
of
those
who
were
better
provided
ah
said
one
of
the
visitors
this
is
a
disagreeable
job
in
your
house
landlord--yes
sir
i'd
sooner
it
had
happened
elsewhere
i
assure
you
i
know
it
has
done
me
no
good
no
no
man
could
expect
any
and
yet
it
is
none
the
less
unfortunate
for
that--i
would
sooner
anything
else
happen
than
that
whatever
it
might
be
i
think
it
must
be
something
very
bad
at
all
events
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
never
see
the
like
again
so
much
the
better
for
the
town
said
another
for
what
with
vampyres
and
riots
there
has
been
but
little
else
stirring
than
mischief
and
disturbances
of
one
kind
and
another
yes
and
what
between
varneys
and
bannerworths
we
have
had
but
little
peace
here
precisely
do
you
know
it's
my
opinion
that
the
least
thing
would
upset
the
whole
town
any
one
unlucky
word
would
do
it
i
am
sure
said
a
tall
thin
man
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
said
another
but
i
hope
the
military
would
do
their
duty
under
such
circumstances
for
people's
lives
and
property
are
not
safe
in
such
a
state
of
things--oh
dear
no
i
wonder
what
has
become
of
varney
or
where
he
can
have
gone
to--some
thought
he
must
have
been
burned
when
they
burned
his
house
replied
the
landlord
but
i
believe
it
generally
understood
he's
escaped
has
he
not
no
traces
of
his
body
were
found
in
the
ruins--none
oh
he's
escaped
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
i
wish
i
had
some
fortune
depending
upon
the
fact
it
would
be
mine
i
am
sure
well
the
lord
keep
us
from
vampyres
and
suchlike
cattle
said
an
old
woman
i
shall
never
sleep
again
in
my
bed
with
any
safety
it
frightens
one
out
of
one's
life
to
think
of
it
what
a
shame
the
men
didn't
catch
him
and
stake
him
the
old
woman
left
the
inn
as
soon
as
she
had
spoke
this
christian
speech
humane
said
a
gentleman
with
a
sporting
coat
on
the
old
woman
is
no
advocate
for
half
measures
you
are
right
sir
said
the
landlord
and
a
very
good
look-out
she
keeps
upon
the
pot
to
see
it's
full
and
carefully
blows
the
froth
off--ah
i
thought
as
much
how
soon
will
the
funeral
take
place
landlord
inquired
a
person
who
had
at
that
moment
entered
the
inn--in
about
an
hour's
time
sir
oh
the
town
seems
pretty
full
though
it
is
very
quiet
i
suppose
it
is
more
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
people
congregate
to
see
the
funeral
of
this
stranger
i
hope
so
sir
the
time
is
wearing
on
and
if
they
don't
make
a
dust
why
then
the
military
will
not
be
troubled
i
do
not
expect
anything
more
sir
said
the
landlord
for
you
see
they
must
have
had
their
swing
out
as
the
saying
is
and
be
fully
satisfied
they
cannot
have
much
more
to
do
in
the
way
of
exhibiting
their
anger
or
dislike
to
vampyres--they
all
have
done
enough
so
they
have--so
they
have
granted
said
an
old
man
with
a
troublesome
cough
but
when
did
you
ever
know
a
mob
to
be
satisfied
if
they
wanted
the
moon
and
got
it
they'd
find
out
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
the
stars
also
that's
uncommonly
true
said
the
landlord
i
shouldn't
be
surprised
if
they
didn't
do
something
worse
than
ever--nothing
more
likely
said
the
little
old
man
i
can
believe
anything
of
a
mob--anything--no
matter
what
the
inn
was
crowded
with
visitors
and
several
extra
hands
were
employed
to
wait
upon
the
customers
and
a
scene
of
bustle
and
activity
was
displayed
that
was
never
before
seen
it
would
glad
the
heart
of
a
landlord
though
he
were
made
of
stone
and
landlords
are
usually
of
much
more
malleable
materials
than
that
however
the
landlord
had
hardly
time
to
congratulate
himself
for
the
bearers
were
come
now
and
the
undertaker
and
his
troop
of
death-following
officials
there
was
a
stir
among
the
people
who
began
now
to
awaken
from
the
lethargy
that
seemed
to
have
come
over
them
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
moment
when
it
should
arrive
that
was
to
place
the
body
under
the
green
sod
against
which
so
much
of
their
anger
had
been
raised
there
was
a
decent
silence
that
pervaded
the
mob
of
individuals
who
had
assembled
death
with
all
its
ghastly
insignia
had
an
effect
even
upon
the
unthinking
multitude
who
were
ever
ready
to
inflict
death
or
any
violent
injury
upon
any
object
that
came
in
their
way--they
never
hesitated
but
even
these
now
the
object
of
their
hatred
was
no
more
felt
appalled
'tis
strange
what
a
change
comes
over
masses
of
men
as
they
gaze
upon
a
dead
body
it
may
be
that
they
all
know
that
to
that
complexion
they
must
come
at
last
this
may
be
the
secret
of
the
respect
offered
to
the
dead
the
undertakers
are
men
however
who
are
used
to
the
presence
of
death--it
is
their
element
they
gain
a
living
by
attending
upon
the
last
obsequies
of
the
dead
they
are
used
to
dead
bodies
and
care
not
for
them
some
of
them
are
humane
men
that
is
in
their
way
and
even
among
them
are
men
who
wouldn't
be
deprived
of
the
joke
as
they
screwed
down
the
last
screw
they
could
not
forbear
even
on
this
occasion
to
hold
their
converse
when
left
alone
jacobs
said
one
who
was
turning
a
long
screw
jacobs
my
boy
do
you
take
the
chair
to-night--yes
said
jacobs
who
was
a
long
lugubrious-looking
man
i
do
take
the
chair
if
i
live
over
this
blessed
event
you
are
not
croaking
jacobs
are
you
well
you
are
a
lively
customer
you
are--lively--do
you
expect
people
to
be
lively
when
they
are
full
dressed
for
a
funeral
you
are
a
nice
article
for
your
profession
you
don't
feel
like
an
undertaker
you
don't
don't
jacobs
my
boy
as
long
as
i
look
like
one
when
occasion
demands
when
i
have
done
my
job
i
puts
my
comfort
in
my
pocket
and
thinks
how
much
more
pleasanter
it
is
to
be
going
to
other
people's
funerals
than
to
our
own
and
then
only
see
the
difference
as
regards
the
money
true
said
jacobs
with
a
groan
but
death's
a
melancholy
article
at
all
events--so
it
is
and
then
when
you
come
to
consider
the
number
of
people
we
have
buried--how
many
have
gone
to
their
last
homes--and
how
many
more
will
go
the
same
way--yes
yes
that's
all
very
well
jacob
you
are
precious
surly
this
morning
i'll
come
to-night
you're
brewing
a
sentimental
tale
as
sure
as
eggs
is
eggs
well
that
is
pretty
certain
but
as
i
was
saying
how
many
more
are
there--
ah
don't
bother
yourself
with
calculations
that
have
neither
beginning
nor
end
and
which
haven't
one
point
to
go
come
jacob
have
you
finished
yet--quite
said
jacob
they
now
arranged
the
pall
and
placed
all
in
readiness
and
returned
to
a
place
down
stairs
where
they
could
enjoy
themselves
for
an
odd
half
hour
and
pass
that
time
away
until
the
moment
should
arrive
when
his
reverence
would
be
ready
to
bury
the
deceased
upon
consideration
of
the
fees
to
be
paid
upon
the
occasion
the
tap-room
was
crowded
and
there
was
no
room
for
the
men
and
they
were
taken
into
the
kitchen
where
they
were
seated
and
earnestly
at
work
preparing
for
the
ceremony
that
had
so
shortly
to
be
performed
any
better
jacobs--what
do
you
mean
inquired
jacobs
with
a
groan
it's
news
to
me
if
i
have
been
ill
oh
yes
you
were
doleful
up
stairs
you
know--i've
a
proper
regard
for
my
profession--that's
the
difference
between
you
and
i
you
know
i'll
wager
you
what
you
like
now
that
i'll
handle
a
corpse
and
drive
a
screw
in
a
coffin
as
well
as
you
now
although
you
are
so
solid
and
miserable--so
you
may--so
you
may
then
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
i
haven't
a
proper
regard
for
my
profession--i
say
you
haven't
and
there's
the
thing
that
shall
prove
it--you
don't
look
it
and
that's
the
truth
i
don't
look
like
an
undertaker
indeed
i
dare
say
i
don't
if
i
ain't
dressed
like
one--nor
when
you
are
reiterated
jacob
why
not
pray--because
you
have
always
a
grin
on
your
face
as
broad
as
a
gridiron--that's
why
this
ended
the
dispute
for
the
employer
of
the
men
suddenly
put
his
head
in
saying--
come
now
time's
up
you
are
wanted
up
stairs
all
of
you
be
quick
we
shall
have
his
reverence
waiting
for
us
and
then
we
shall
lose
his
recommendation
ready
sir
said
the
round
man
taking
up
his
pint
and
finishing
it
off
at
a
draught
at
the
same
moment
he
thrust
the
remains
of
some
bread
and
cheese
into
his
pocket
jacob
too
took
his
pot
and
having
finished
it
with
great
gravity
followed
the
example
of
his
more
jocose
companion
and
they
all
left
the
kitchen
for
the
room
above
where
the
corpse
was
lying
ready
for
interment
there
was
an
unusual
bustle
everybody
was
on
the
tip-top
of
expectation
and
awaiting
the
result
in
a
quiet
hurry
and
hoped
to
have
the
first
glimpse
of
the
coffin
though
why
they
should
do
so
it
was
difficult
to
define
but
in
this
fit
of
mysterious
hope
and
expectation
they
certainly
stood
will
they
be
long
inquired
a
man
at
the
door
of
one
inside--will
they
be
long
before
they
come--they
are
coming
now
said
the
man
do
you
all
keep
quiet
they
are
knocking
their
heads
against
the
top
of
the
landing
hark
there
i
told
you
so
the
man
departed
hearing
something
and
being
satisfied
that
he
had
got
some
information
now
then
said
the
landlord
move
out
of
the
way
and
allow
the
corpse
to
pass
out
let
me
have
no
indecent
conduct
let
everything
be
as
it
should
be
the
people
soon
removed
from
the
passage
and
vicinity
of
the
doorway
and
then
the
mournful
procession--as
the
newspapers
have
it--moved
forward
they
were
heard
coming
down
stairs
and
thence
along
the
passage
until
they
came
to
the
street
and
then
the
whole
number
of
attendants
was
plainly
discernible
how
different
was
the
funeral
of
one
who
had
friends
he
was
alone
none
followed
save
the
undertaker
and
his
attendants
all
of
whom
looked
solemn
from
habit
and
professional
motives
even
the
jocose
man
was
as
supernaturally
solemn
as
could
be
well
imagined
indeed
nobody
knew
he
was
the
same
man
well
said
the
landlord
as
he
watched
them
down
the
street
as
they
slowly
paced
their
way
with
funereal
not
sorrowful
solemnity--well
i
am
very
glad
that
it
is
all
over
it
has
been
a
sad
plague
to
you
said
one
it
has
indeed
it
must
be
to
any
one
who
has
had
another
such
a
job
as
this
i
don't
say
it
out
of
any
disrespect
to
the
poor
man
who
is
dead
and
gone--quite
the
reverse
but
i
would
not
have
such
another
affair
on
my
hands
for
pounds
i
can
easily
believe
you
especially
when
we
come
to
consider
the
disagreeables
of
a
mob
you
may
say
that
there's
no
knowing
what
they
will
or
won't
do
confound
them
if
they'd
act
like
men
and
pay
for
what
they
have
why
then
i
shouldn't
care
much
about
them
but
it
don't
do
to
have
other
people
in
the
bar
i
should
think
not
indeed
that
would
alter
the
scale
of
your
profits
i
reckon
it
would
make
all
the
difference
to
me
business
added
the
landlord
conducted
on
that
scale
would
become
a
loss
and
a
man
might
as
well
walk
into
a
well
at
once
so
i
should
say
have
many
such
occurrences
as
these
been
usual
in
this
part
of
the
country
inquired
the
stranger
not
usual
at
all
said
the
landlord
but
the
fact
is
the
whole
neighbourhood
has
run
distracted
about
some
superhuman
being
they
call
a
vampyre
indeed--yes
and
they
suspected
the
unfortunate
man
who
has
been
lying
up-stairs
a
corpse
for
some
days
oh
the
man
they
have
just
taken
in
the
coffin
to
bury
said
the
stranger
yes
sir
the
same
well
i
thought
perhaps
somebody
of
great
consequence
had
suddenly
become
defunct--oh
dear
no
it
would
not
have
caused
half
the
sensation
people
have
been
really
mad
it
was
a
strange
occurrence
altogether
i
believe
was
it
inquired
the
stranger--indeed
it
was
sir
i
hardly
know
the
particulars
there
have
been
so
many
tales
afloat
though
they
all
concur
in
one
point
and
that
is
it
has
destroyed
the
peace
of
one
family
who
has
done
so--the
vampyre
indeed
i
never
heard
of
such
an
animal
save
as
a
fable
before
it
seems
to
me
extraordinary
so
it
would
do
to
any
one
sir
as
was
not
on
the
spot
to
see
it
i'm
sure
i
wouldn't





in
the
meantime
the
procession
short
as
it
was
of
itself
moved
along
in
slow
time
through
a
throng
of
people
who
ran
out
of
their
houses
on
either
side
of
the
way
and
lined
the
whole
length
of
the
town
many
of
these
closed
in
behind
and
followed
the
mourners
until
they
were
near
the
church
and
then
they
made
a
rush
to
get
into
the
churchyard
as
yet
all
had
been
conducted
with
tolerable
propriety
the
funeral
met
with
no
impediment
the
presence
of
death
among
so
many
of
them
seemed
some
check
upon
the
licence
of
the
mob
who
bowed
in
silence
to
the
majesty
of
death
who
could
bear
ill-will
against
him
who
was
now
no
more
man
while
he
is
man
is
always
the
subject
of
hatred
fear
or
love
some
one
of
these
passions
in
a
modified
state
exists
in
all
men
and
with
such
feelings
they
will
regard
each
other
and
it
is
barely
possible
that
any
one
should
not
be
the
object
of
some
of
these
and
hence
the
stranger's
corpse
was
treated
with
respect
in
silence
the
body
proceeded
along
the
highway
until
it
came
to
the
churchyard
and
followed
by
an
immense
multitude
of
people
of
all
grades
the
authorities
trembled
they
knew
not
what
all
this
portended
they
thought
it
might
pass
off
but
it
might
become
a
storm
first
they
hoped
and
feared
by
turns
till
some
of
them
fell
sick
with
apprehension
there
was
a
deep
silence
observed
by
all
those
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
coffin
but
those
farther
in
the
rear
found
full
expression
for
their
feelings
do
you
think
said
an
old
man
to
another
that
he
will
come
to
life
again
eh--oh
yes
vampyres
always
do
and
lay
in
the
moonlight
and
then
they
come
to
life
again
moonlight
recovers
a
vampyre
to
life
again
and
yet
the
moonlight
is
cold--ah
but
who's
to
tell
what
may
happen
to
a
vampyre
or
what's
hot
or
what's
cold
certainly
not
oh
dear
no--and
then
they
have
permission
to
suck
the
blood
of
other
people
to
live
themselves
and
to
make
other
people
vampyres
too
the
lord
have
mercy
upon
us--ay
but
they
have
driven
a
stake
through
this
one
and
he
can't
get
in
moonlight
or
daylight
it's
all
over--he's
certainly
done
for
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
on
this
point
so
we
may--so
we
may
they
now
neared
the
grave
the
clergyman
officiating
as
usual
on
such
occasions
there
was
a
large
mob
of
persons
on
all
sides
with
serious
faces
watching
the
progress
of
the
ceremony
and
who
listened
in
quietness
there
was
no
sign
of
any
disturbance
amongst
the
people
and
the
authorities
were
well
pleased
they
congratulated
themselves
upon
the
quietness
and
orderliness
of
the
assemblage
the
service
was
ended
and
the
coffin
lowered
and
the
earth
was
thrown
on
the
coffin-lid
with
a
hollow
sound
nobody
could
hear
that
sound
unmoved
but
in
a
short
while
the
sound
ceased
as
the
grave
became
filled
it
was
then
trodden
carefully
down
there
were
no
relatives
there
to
feel
affected
at
the
last
scene
of
all
they
were
far
away
and
according
to
popular
belief
upon
the
subject
they
must
have
been
dead
some
ages





the
mob
watched
the
last
shovel-full
of
earth
thrown
upon
the
coffin
and
witnessed
the
ramming
down
of
the
soil
and
the
heaping
of
it
over
at
top
to
make
the
usual
monument
for
all
this
was
done
speedily
and
carefully
lest
there
should
be
any
tendency
to
exhume
the
body
of
the
deceased
the
people
were
now
somewhat
relieved
as
to
their
state
of
solemnity
and
silence
they
would
all
of
them
converse
freely
on
the
matter
that
had
so
long
occupied
their
thoughts
they
seemed
now
let
loose
and
everybody
found
himself
at
liberty
to
say
or
do
something
no
matter
if
it
were
not
very
reasonable
that
is
not
always
required
of
human
beings
who
have
souls
or
at
least
it
is
unexpected
and
were
it
expected
the
expectation
would
never
be
realized
the
day
was
likely
to
wear
away
without
a
riot
nay
even
without
a
fight
a
most
extraordinary
occurrence
for
such
a
place
under
the
existing
circumstances
for
of
late
the
populace
or
perhaps
the
townspeople
were
extremely
pugnacious
and
many
were
the
disputes
that
were
settled
by
the
very
satisfactory
application
of
the
knuckles
to
the
head
of
the
party
holding
a
contrary
opinion
thus
it
was
they
were
ready
to
take
fire
and
a
hubbub
would
be
the
result
of
the
slightest
provocation
but
on
the
present
occasion
there
was
a
remarkable
dearth
of
all
subjects
of
the
nature
described
who
was
to
lead
israel
out
to
battle
alas
no
one
on
the
present
occasion
such
a
one
however
appeared
at
least
one
who
furnished
a
ready
excuse
for
a
disturbance
suddenly
mrs
chillingworth
appeared
in
the
midst
of
a
large
concourse
of
people
she
had
just
left
her
house
which
was
close
at
hand
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
and
her
children
around
her
on
this
occasion
the
crowd
made
way
for
her
and
gathered
round
her
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
friends
and
neighbours
she
said
can
any
of
you
relieve
the
tears
of
a
distressed
wife
and
mother
have
any
of
you
seen
anything
of
my
husband
mr
chillingworth
what
the
doctor
exclaimed
one--yes
mr
chillingworth
the
surgeon
he
has
not
been
home
two
days
and
a
night
i'm
distracted--what
can
have
become
of
him
i
don't
know
unless--
here
mrs
chillingworth
paused
and
some
person
said--
unless
what
mrs
chillingworth
there
are
none
but
friends
here
who
wish
the
doctor
well
and
would
do
anything
to
serve
him--unless
what
speak
out
unless
he's
been
destroyed
by
the
vampyre
heaven
knows
what
we
may
all
come
to
here
am
i
and
my
children
deprived
of
our
protector
by
some
means
which
we
cannot
imagine
he
never
in
all
his
life
did
the
same
before
he
must
have
been
spirited
away
by
some
of
the
vampyres
i'll
tell
you
what
friend
said
one
to
another
that
something
must
be
done
nobody's
safe
in
their
bed
no
they
are
not
indeed
i
think
that
all
vampyres
ought
to
be
burned
and
a
stake
run
through
them
and
then
we
should
be
safe
ay
but
you
must
destroy
all
those
who
are
even
suspected
of
being
vampyres
or
else
one
may
do
all
the
mischief--so
he
might
hurrah
shouted
the
mob
chillingworth
for
ever
we'll
find
the
doctor
somewhere
if
we
pull
down
the
whole
town
there
was
an
immense
commotion
among
the
populace
who
began
to
start
throwing
stones
and
do
all
sorts
of
things
without
any
particular
object
and
some
as
they
said
to
find
the
doctor
or
to
show
how
willing
they
were
to
do
so
if
they
knew
how
mrs
chillingworth
however
kept
on
talking
to
the
mob
who
continued
shouting
and
the
authorities
anticipated
an
immediate
outbreak
of
popular
opinion
which
is
generally
accompanied
by
some
forcible
demonstration
and
on
this
occasion
some
one
suggested
the
propriety
of
burning
down
bannerworth
hall
because
they
had
burned
down
the
vampyre's
home
and
they
might
as
well
burn
down
that
of
the
injured
party
which
was
carried
by
acclamation
and
with
loud
shouts
they
started
on
their
errand
this
was
a
mob's
proceeding
all
over
and
we
regret
very
much
to
say
that
it
is
very
much
the
characteristic
of
english
mobs
what
an
uncommonly
strange
thing
it
is
that
people
in
multitudes
seem
completely
to
get
rid
of
all
reason--all
honour--all
common
ordinary
honesty
while
if
you
were
to
take
the
same
people
singly
you
would
find
that
they
were
reasonable
enough
and
would
shrink
with
a
feeling
quite
approaching
to
horror
from
anything
in
the
shape
of
very
flagrant
injustice
this
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
a
piece
of
cowardice
in
the
human
race
which
induces
them
when
alone
and
acting
with
the
full
responsibility
of
their
actions
to
shrink
from
what
it
is
quite
evident
they
have
a
full
inclination
to
do
and
will
do
when
having
partially
lost
their
individuality
in
a
crowd
they
fancy
that
to
a
certain
extent
they
can
do
so
with
impunity
the
burning
of
sir
francis
varney's
house
although
it
was
one
of
those
proceedings
which
would
not
bear
the
test
of
patient
examination
was
yet
when
we
take
all
the
circumstances
into
consideration
an
act
really
justifiable
and
natural
in
comparison
with
the
one
which
was
now
meditated
bannerworth
hall
had
never
been
the
residence
even
of
anyone
who
had
done
the
people
any
injury
or
given
them
any
offence
so
that
to
let
it
become
a
prey
to
the
flames
was
but
a
gratuitous
act
of
mischief
it
was
however
or
seemed
to
be
doomed
for
all
who
have
had
any
experience
in
mobs
must
know
how
extremely
difficult
it
is
to
withdraw
them
from
any
impulse
once
given
especially
when
that
impulse
as
in
the
present
instance
is
of
a
violent
character
down
with
bannerworth
hall
was
the
cry
burn
it--burn
it
and
augmented
by
fresh
numbers
each
minute
the
ignorant
and
in
many
respects
ruffianly
assemblage
soon
arrived
within
sight
of
what
had
been
for
so
many
years
the
bane
of
the
bannerworths
and
whatever
may
have
been
the
fault
of
some
of
that
race
those
faults
had
been
of
a
domestic
character
and
not
at
all
such
as
would
interfere
with
the
public
weal
the
astonished
and
almost
worn-out
authorities
hastily
now
after
having
disposed
of
their
prisoners
collected
together
what
troops
they
could
and
by
the
time
the
misguided
or
rather
the
not
guided
at
all
populace
had
got
halfway
to
bannerworth
hall
they
were
being
outflanked
by
some
of
the
dragoons
who
by
taking
a
more
direct
route
hoped
to
reach
bannerworth
hall
first
and
so
perhaps
by
letting
the
mob
see
that
it
was
defended
induce
them
to
give
up
the
idea
of
its
destruction
on
account
of
the
danger
attendant
upon
the
proceeding
by
far
exceeding
any
of
the
anticipated
delight
of
the
disturbance
illustration
the
strange
meeting
at
the
hall
between
mr
chillingworth
and
the
mysterious
friend
of
varney
illustration
when
we
praise
our
friend
mr
chillingworth
for
not
telling
his
wife
where
he
was
going
in
pursuance
of
a
caution
and
a
discrimination
so
highly
creditable
to
him
we
are
quite
certain
that
he
has
no
such
excuse
as
regards
the
reader
therefore
we
say
at
once
that
he
had
his
own
reasons
now
for
taking
up
his
abode
at
bannerworth
hall
for
a
time
these
reasons
seemed
to
be
all
dependant
upon
the
fact
of
having
met
the
mysterious
man
at
sir
francis
varney's
and
although
we
perhaps
would
have
hoped
that
the
doctor
might
have
communicated
to
henry
bannerworth
all
that
he
knew
and
all
that
he
surmised
yet
have
we
no
doubt
that
what
he
keeps
to
himself
he
has
good
reasons
for
so
keeping
and
that
his
actions
as
regards
it
are
founded
upon
some
very
just
conclusions
he
has
then
made
a
determination
to
take
possession
of
and
remain
in
bannerworth
hall
according
to
the
full
and
free
leave
which
the
admiral
had
given
him
so
to
do
what
results
he
anticipated
from
so
lonely
and
so
secret
a
watch
we
cannot
say
but
probably
they
will
soon
exhibit
themselves
it
needed
no
sort
of
extraordinary
discrimination
for
any
one
to
feel
it
once
that
not
the
least
good
in
the
way
of
an
ambuscade
was
likely
to
be
effected
by
such
persons
as
admiral
bell
or
jack
pringle
they
were
all
very
well
when
fighting
should
actually
ensue
but
they
both
were
certainly
remarkably
and
completely
deficient
in
diplomatic
skill
or
in
that
sort
of
patience
which
should
enable
them
at
all
to
compete
with
the
cunning
the
skill
and
the
nice
discrimination
of
such
a
man
as
sir
francis
varney
if
anything
were
to
be
done
in
that
way
it
was
unquestionably
to
be
done
by
some
one
alone
who
like
the
doctor
would
and
could
remain
profoundly
quiet
and
await
the
issue
of
events
be
they
what
they
might
and
probably
remain
a
spy
and
attempt
no
overt
act
which
should
be
of
a
hostile
character
this
unquestionably
was
the
mode
and
perhaps
we
should
not
be
going
too
far
when
we
say
it
was
the
only
mode
which
could
be
with
anything
like
safety
relied
upon
as
one
likely
to
lead
really
to
a
discovery
of
sir
francis
varney's
motives
in
making
such
determined
exertions
to
get
possession
of
bannerworth
hall
that
night
was
doomed
to
be
a
very
eventful
one
indeed
for
on
it
had
charles
holland
been
by
a
sort
of
wild
impulsive
generosity
of
sir
francis
varney
rescued
from
the
miserable
dungeon
in
which
he
had
been
confined
and
on
that
night
too
he
whom
we
cannot
otherwise
describe
than
as
the
villain
marchdale
had
been
in
consequence
of
the
evil
that
he
himself
meditated
and
the
crime
with
which
he
was
quite
willing
to
stain
his
soul
been
condemned
to
occupy
charles's
position
on
that
night
too
had
the
infuriated
mob
determined
upon
the
destruction
of
bannerworth
hall
and
on
that
night
was
mr
chillingworth
waiting
with
what
patience
he
could
exert
at
the
hall
for
whatever
in
the
chapter
of
accidents
might
turn
up
of
an
advantageous
character
to
that
family
in
whose
welfare
and
fortunes
he
felt
so
friendly
and
so
deep
an
interest
let
us
look
then
at
the
worthy
doctor
as
he
keeps
his
solitary
watch
he
did
not
as
had
been
the
case
when
the
admiral
shared
the
place
with
him
in
the
hope
of
catching
varney
on
that
memorable
occasion
when
he
caught
only
his
boot
sit
in
a
room
with
a
light
and
the
means
and
appliances
for
making
the
night
pass
pleasantly
away
but
on
the
contrary
he
abandoned
the
house
altogether
and
took
up
a
station
in
that
summer-house
which
has
been
before
mentioned
as
the
scene
of
a
remarkable
interview
between
flora
bannerworth
and
varney
the
vampyre
alone
and
in
the
dark
so
that
he
could
not
be
probably
seen
he
watched
that
one
window
of
the
chamber
where
the
first
appearance
of
the
hideous
vampyre
had
taken
place
and
which
seemed
ever
since
to
be
the
special
object
of
his
attack
by
remaining
from
twilight
and
getting
accustomed
to
the
gradually
increasing
darkness
of
the
place
no
doubt
the
doctor
was
able
to
see
well
enough
without
the
aid
of
any
artificial
light
whether
any
one
was
in
the
place
besides
himself
night
after
night
he
said
will
i
watch
here
until
i
have
succeeded
in
unravelling
this
mystery
for
that
there
is
some
fearful
and
undreamt
of
mystery
at
the
bottom
of
all
these
proceedings
i
am
well
convinced
when
he
made
such
a
determination
as
this
dr
chillingworth
was
not
at
all
a
likely
man
to
break
it
so
there
looking
like
a
modern
statue
in
the
arbour
he
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
balcony
and
the
window
of
what
used
to
be
called
flora's
room
for
some
hours
the
doctor
was
a
contemplative
man
and
therefore
he
did
not
so
acutely
feel
the
loneliness
of
his
position
as
many
persons
would
have
done
moreover
he
was
decidedly
not
of
a
superstitious
turn
of
mind
although
certainly
we
cannot
deny
an
imagination
to
him
however
if
he
really
had
harboured
some
strange
fears
and
terrors
they
would
have
been
excusable
when
we
consider
how
many
circumstances
had
combined
to
make
it
almost
a
matter
of
demonstration
that
sir
francis
varney
was
something
more
than
mortal
what
quantities
of
subjects
the
doctor
thought
over
during
his
vigil
in
that
garden
it
is
hard
to
say
but
never
in
his
whole
life
probably
had
he
such
a
glorious
opportunity
for
the
most
undisturbed
contemplation
of
subjects
requiring
deep
thought
to
analyze
than
as
he
had
then
at
least
he
felt
that
since
his
marriage
he
had
never
been
so
thoroughly
quiet
and
left
so
completely
to
himself
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
he
succeeded
in
settling
any
medical
points
of
a
knotty
character
that
might
be
hovering
in
his
brain
and
certain
it
is
that
he
had
become
quite
absorbed
in
an
abstruse
matter
connected
with
physiology
when
his
ears
were
startled
and
he
was
at
once
aroused
to
a
full
consciousness
of
where
he
was
and
why
he
had
come
there
by
the
distant
sound
of
a
man's
footstep
it
was
a
footstep
which
seemed
to
be
that
of
a
person
who
scarcely
thought
it
at
all
necessary
to
use
any
caution
and
the
doctor's
heart
leaped
within
him
as
in
the
lowest
possible
whisper
he
said
to
himself--
i
am
successful--i
am
successful
it
is
believed
now
that
the
hall
is
deserted
and
no
doubt
that
is
sir
francis
varney
come
with
confidence
to
carry
out
his
object
in
so
sedulously
attacking
it
be
that
object
what
it
may
elated
with
this
idea
the
doctor
listened
intently
to
the
advancing
footstep
which
each
moment
sounded
more
clearly
upon
his
ears
it
was
evidently
approaching
from
the
garden
entrance
towards
the
house
and
he
thought
by
the
occasional
deadened
sound
of
the
person's
feet
be
he
whom
he
might
that
he
could
not
see
his
way
very
well
and
consequently
frequently
strayed
from
the
path
on
to
some
of
the
numerous
flower-beds
which
were
in
the
way
yes
said
the
doctor
exultingly
it
must
be
varney
and
now
i
have
but
to
watch
him
and
not
to
resist
him
for
what
good
on
earth
is
it
to
stop
him
in
what
he
wishes
to
do
and
by
such
means
never
wrest
his
secret
from
him
the
only
way
is
to
let
him
go
on
and
that
will
i
do
most
certainly
now
he
heard
the
indistinct
muttering
of
the
voice
of
some
one
so
low
that
he
could
not
catch
what
words
were
uttered
but
he
fancied
that
in
the
deep
tones
he
recognised
without
any
doubt
the
voice
of
sir
francis
varney
it
must
be
he
he
said
it
surely
must
be
he
who
else
would
come
here
to
disturb
the
solitude
of
an
empty
house
he
comes
he
comes
now
the
doctor
could
see
a
figure
emerge
from
behind
some
thick
beeches
which
had
before
obstructed
his
vision
and
he
looked
scrutinisingly
about
while
some
doubts
stole
slowly
over
his
mind
now
as
to
whether
it
was
the
vampyre
or
not
the
height
was
in
favour
of
the
supposition
that
it
was
none
other
than
varney
but
the
figure
looked
so
much
stouter
that
mr
chillingworth
felt
a
little
staggered
upon
the
subject
and
unable
wholly
to
make
up
his
mind
upon
it
the
pausing
of
this
visitor
too
opposite
that
window
where
sir
francis
varney
had
made
his
attempts
was
another
strong
reason
why
the
doctor
was
inclined
to
believe
it
must
be
him
and
yet
he
could
not
quite
make
up
his
mind
upon
the
subject
so
as
to
speak
with
certainty
a
very
short
time
however
indeed
must
have
sufficed
to
set
such
a
question
as
that
at
rest
and
patience
seemed
the
only
quality
of
mind
necessary
under
those
circumstances
for
mr
chillingworth
to
exert
the
visitor
continued
gazing
either
at
that
window
or
at
the
whole
front
of
the
house
for
several
minutes
and
then
he
turned
away
from
a
contemplation
of
it
and
walked
slowly
along
parallel
with
the
windows
of
that
dining-room
one
of
which
had
been
broken
so
completely
on
the
occasion
of
the
admiral's
attempt
to
take
the
vampyre
prisoner
the
moment
the
stranger
altered
his
position
from
looking
at
the
window
and
commenced
walking
away
from
it
mr
chillingworth's
mind
was
made
up
it
was
not
varney--of
that
he
felt
now
most
positively
assured
and
could
have
no
doubt
whatever
upon
the
subject
the
gait
the
general
air
the
walk
all
were
different
and
then
arose
the
anxious
question
of
who
could
it
be
that
had
intruded
upon
that
lonely
place
and
what
could
be
the
object
of
any
one
else
but
varney
the
vampyre
to
do
so
the
stranger
looked
a
powerful
man
and
walked
with
a
firm
tread
and
altogether
he
was
an
opponent
that
had
the
doctor
been
ever
so
belligerently
inclined
it
would
have
been
the
height
of
indiscretion
for
him
to
attempt
to
cope
with
it
was
a
very
vexatious
thing
too
for
any
one
to
come
there
at
such
a
juncture
perhaps
only
from
motives
of
curiosity
or
possibly
just
to
endeavour
to
commit
some
petty
depredations
upon
the
deserted
building
if
possible
and
most
heartily
did
the
doctor
wish
that
in
some
way
he
could
scare
away
the
intruder
the
man
walked
along
very
slowly
indeed
and
seemed
to
be
quite
taking
his
time
in
making
his
observations
of
the
building
and
this
was
the
more
provoking
as
it
was
getting
late
and
if
having
projected
a
visit
at
all
it
would
surely
soon
be
made
and
then
when
he
found
any
one
there
of
course
he
would
go
amazed
beyond
expression
the
doctor
felt
about
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
until
he
found
a
tolerably
large
stone
which
he
threw
at
the
stranger
with
so
good
an
aim
that
it
hit
him
a
smart
blow
on
the
back
which
must
have
been
anything
but
a
pleasant
surprise
that
it
was
a
surprise
and
that
too
a
most
complete
one
was
evident
from
the
start
which
the
man
gave
and
then
he
uttered
a
furious
oath
and
rubbed
his
back
as
he
glanced
about
him
to
endeavour
to
ascertain
from
whence
the
missile
had
come
i'll
try
him
again
with
that
thought
the
doctor
it
may
succeed
in
scaring
him
away
and
he
stooped
to
watch
for
another
stone
it
was
well
that
he
did
so
at
that
precise
moment
for
before
he
rose
again
he
heard
the
sharp
report
of
a
pistol
and
a
crashing
sound
among
some
of
the
old
wood
work
of
which
the
summer-house
was
composed
told
him
that
a
shot
had
there
taken
effect
affairs
were
now
getting
much
too
serious
and
accordingly
dr
chillingworth
thought
that
rather
than
stay
there
to
be
made
a
target
of
he
would
face
the
intruder
hold--hold
he
cried
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
mean
by
that--oh
somebody
is
there
cried
the
man
as
he
advanced
my
friend
whoever
you
are
you
were
very
foolish
to
throw
a
stone
at
me
and
my
friend
whoever
you
are
responded
the
doctor
you
were
very
spiteful
to
fire
a
pistol
bullet
at
me
in
consequence--
not
at
all
but
i
say
yes
for
probably
i
can
prove
a
right
to
be
here
which
you
cannot--ah
said
the
stranger
that
voice--why--you
are
dr
chillingworth
i
am
but
i
don't
know
you
said
the
doctor
as
he
emerged
now
from
the
summer-house
and
confronted
the
stranger
who
was
within
a
few
paces
of
the
entrance
to
it
then
he
started
as
he
added--
yes
i
do
know
you
though
how
in
the
name
of
heaven
came
you
here
and
what
purpose
have
you
in
so
coming
what
purpose
have
you
since
we
met
at
varney's
i
have
been
making
some
inquiries
about
this
neighbourhood
and
learn
strange
things--that
you
may
very
easily
do
here
and
what
is
more
extraordinary
the
strange
things
are
for
the
most
part
i
can
assure
you
quite
true
the
reader
will
from
what
has
been
said
now
readily
recognise
this
man
as
sir
francis
varney's
mysterious
visitor
to
whom
he
gave
from
some
hidden
cause
or
another
so
large
a
sum
of
money
and
between
whom
and
dr
chillingworth
a
mutual
recognition
had
taken
place
on
the
occasion
when
sir
francis
varney
had
with
such
cool
assurance
invited
the
admiral
to
breakfast
with
him
at
his
new
abode
you
however
said
the
man
i
have
no
doubt
are
fully
qualified
to
tell
me
of
more
than
i
have
been
able
to
learn
from
other
people
and
first
of
all
let
me
ask
you
why
you
are
here--before
i
answer
you
that
question
or
any
other
said
the
doctor
let
me
beg
of
you
to
tell
me
truly
is
sir
francis
varney--
the
doctor
whispered
in
the
ear
of
the
stranger
some
name
as
if
he
feared
even
there
in
the
silence
of
that
garden
where
everything
conspired
to
convince
him
that
he
could
not
be
overheard
to
pronounce
it
in
an
audible
tone
he
is
said
the
other--you
have
no
manner
of
doubt
of
it
doubt--certainly
not
what
doubt
can
i
have
i
know
it
for
a
positive
certainty
and
he
knows
of
course
that
i
do
know
it
and
has
purchased
my
silence
pretty
handsomely
although
i
must
confess
that
nothing
but
my
positive
necessities
would
have
induced
me
to
make
the
large
demands
upon
him
that
i
have
and
i
hope
soon
to
be
able
to
release
him
altogether
from
them
the
doctor
shook
his
head
repeatedly
as
he
said--
i
suspected
it
i
suspected
it
do
you
know
from
the
first
moment
that
i
saw
you
there
in
his
house
his
face
haunted
me
ever
since--awfully
haunted
me
and
yet
although
i
felt
certain
that
i
had
once
seen
it
under
strange
circumstances
i
could
not
identify
it
with--but
no
matter
no
matter
i
am
waiting
here
for
him
indeed--ay
that
i
am
and
i
flung
a
stone
at
you
not
knowing
you
with
hope
that
you
would
be
by
such
means
perhaps
scared
away
and
so
leave
the
coast
clear
for
him
then
you
have
an
appointment
with
him--by
no
means
but
he
has
made
such
repeated
and
determined
attacks
upon
this
house
that
the
family
who
inhabited
it
were
compelled
to
leave
it
and
i
am
here
to
watch
him
and
ascertain
what
can
possibly
be
his
object
it
is
as
i
suspected
then
muttered
this
man
confound
him
now
can
i
read
as
if
in
a
book
most
clearly
the
game
that
he
is
playing
can
you
cried
the
doctor
energetically--can
you
what
is
it
tell
me
for
that
is
the
very
thing
i
want
to
discover--you
don't
say
so
it
is
indeed
and
i
assure
you
that
it
concerns
the
peace
of
a
whole
family
to
know
it
you
say
you
have
made
inquiries
about
this
neighbourhood
and
if
you
have
done
so
you
have
discovered
how
the
family
of
the
bannerworths
have
been
persecuted
by
varney
and
how
in
particular
flora
bannerworth
a
beautiful
and
intelligent
girl
has
been
most
cruelly
made
to
suffer
i
have
heard
all
that
and
i
dare
say
with
many
exaggerations--it
would
be
difficult
for
any
one
really
to
exaggerate
the
horrors
that
have
taken
place
in
this
house
so
that
any
information
which
you
can
give
respecting
the
motives
of
varney
will
tend
probably
to
restore
peace
to
those
who
have
been
so
cruelly
persecuted
and
be
an
act
of
kindness
which
i
think
not
altogether
inconsistent
with
your
nature
you
think
so
and
yet
know
who
i
am--i
do
indeed
and
what
i
am
why
if
i
were
to
go
into
the
market-place
of
yon
town
and
proclaim
myself
would
not
all
shun
me--ay
even
the
very
lowest
and
vilest
and
yet
you
talk
of
an
act
of
kindness
not
being
altogether
inconsistent
with
my
nature--i
do
because
i
know
something
more
of
you
than
many
there
was
a
silence
of
some
moments'
duration
and
then
the
stranger
spoke
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
looked
as
if
he
were
struggling
with
some
emotion
sir
you
do
know
more
of
me
than
many
you
know
what
i
have
been
and
you
know
how
i
left
an
occupation
which
would
have
made
me
loathed
but
you--even
you--do
not
know
what
made
me
take
to
so
terrible
a
trade--i
do
not
would
it
suit
you
for
me
now
to
tell
you--will
you
first
promise
me
that
you
will
do
all
you
can
for
this
persecuted
family
of
the
bannerworths
in
whom
i
take
so
strange
an
interest
i
will
i
promise
you
that
freely
of
my
own
knowledge
of
course
i
can
say
but
little
concerning
them
but
upon
that
warranting
i
well
believe
they
deserve
abundant
sympathy
and
from
me
they
shall
have
it
a
thousand
thanks
with
your
assistance
i
have
little
doubt
of
being
able
to
extricate
them
from
the
tangled
web
of
dreadful
incidents
which
has
turned
them
from
their
home
and
now
whatever
you
may
choose
to
tell
me
of
the
cause
which
drove
you
to
be
what
you
became
i
shall
listen
to
with
abundant
interest
only
let
me
beseech
you
to
come
into
this
summer-house
and
to
talk
low
i
will
and
you
can
pursue
your
watch
at
the
same
time
while
i
beguile
its
weariness--be
it
so
you
knew
me
years
ago
when
i
had
all
the
chances
in
the
world
of
becoming
respectable
and
respected
i
did
indeed
and
you
may
therefore
judge
of
my
surprise
when
some
years
since
being
in
the
metropolis
i
met
you
and
you
shunned
my
company--yes
but
at
last
you
found
out
why
it
was
that
i
shunned
your
company
i
did
you
yourself
told
me
once
that
i
met
you
and
would
not
leave
you
but
insisted
upon
your
dining
with
me
then
you
told
me
when
you
found
that
i
would
take
no
other
course
whatever
that
you
were
no
other
than
the--the------
out
with
it
i
can
bear
to
hear
it
now
better
than
i
could
then
i
told
you
that
i
was
the
common
hangman
of
london
you
did
i
must
confess
to
my
most
intense
surprise
yes
and
yet
you
kept
to
me
and
but
that
i
respected
you
too
much
to
allow
you
to
do
so
you
would
from
old
associations
have
countenanced
me
but
i
could
not
and
i
would
not
let
you
do
so
i
told
you
then
that
although
i
held
the
terrible
office
that
i
had
not
been
yet
called
upon
to
perform
its
loathsome
functions
soon--soon--come
the
first
effort--it
was
the
last
indeed
you
left
the
dreadful
trade
i
did--i
did
but
what
i
want
to
tell
you
for
i
could
not
then
was
why
i
went
ever
to
it
the
wounds
my
heart
had
received
were
then
too
fresh
to
allow
me
to
speak
of
them
but
i
will
tell
you
now
the
story
is
a
brief
one
mr
chillingworth
i
pray
you
be
seated
the
strange
story--the
arrival
of
the
mob
at
the
hall
and
their
dispersion
illustration
you
will
find
that
the
time
which
elapsed
since
i
last
saw
you
in
london
to
have
been
spent
in
an
eventful
varied
manner--you
were
in
good
circumstances
then
said
mr
chillingworth--i
was
but
many
events
happened
after
that
which
altered
the
prospect
made
it
even
more
gloomy
than
you
can
well
imagine
but
i
will
tell
you
all
candidly
and
you
can
keep
watch
upon
bannerworth
hall
at
the
same
time
you
are
well
aware
that
i
was
well
to
do
and
had
ample
funds
and
inclination
to
spend
them--i
recollect
but
you
were
married
then
surely--i
was
said
the
stranger
sadly
i
was
married
then--and
now--i
am
a
widower
the
stranger
seemed
much
moved
but
after
a
moment
or
so
he
resumed--i
am
a
widower
now
but
how
that
event
came
about
is
partly
my
purpose
to
tell
you
i
had
not
married
long--that
is
very
long--for
i
have
but
one
child
and
she
is
not
old
or
of
an
age
to
know
much
more
than
what
she
may
be
taught
she
is
still
in
the
course
of
education
i
was
early
addicted
to
gamble
the
dice
had
its
charms
as
all
those
who
have
ever
engaged
in
play
but
too
well
know
it
is
perfectly
fascinating--so
i
have
heard
said
mr
chillingworth
though
for
myself
i
found
a
wife
and
professional
pursuits
quite
incompatible
with
any
pleasure
that
took
either
time
or
resources--
it
is
so
i
would
i
had
never
entered
one
of
those
houses
where
men
are
deprived
of
their
money
and
their
own
free
will
for
at
the
gambling-table
you
have
no
liberty
save
that
in
gliding
down
the
stream
in
company
with
others
how
few
have
ever
escaped
destruction--none
i
believe--men
are
perfectly
fascinated
it
is
ruin
alone
that
enables
a
man
to
see
how
he
has
been
hurried
onwards
without
thought
or
reflection
and
how
fallacious
were
all
the
hopes
he
ever
entertained
yes
ruin
and
ruin
alone
can
do
this
but
alas
'tis
then
too
late--the
evil
is
done
soon
after
my
marriage
i
fell
in
with
a
chevalier
st
john
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
one
that
was
well
versed
in
all
the
ways
of
society
i
never
met
with
any
man
who
was
so
perfectly
master
of
himself
and
of
perfect
ease
and
self-confidence
as
he
was
he
was
never
at
a
loss
and
come
what
would
never
betrayed
surprise
or
vexation--two
qualities
he
thought
never
ought
to
be
shown
by
any
man
who
moved
in
society--
indeed--he
was
a
strange
man--a
very
strange
man--
did
he
gamble--
it
is
difficult
to
give
you
a
correct
and
direct
answer
i
should
say
he
did
and
yet
he
never
lost
or
won
much
but
i
have
often
thought
he
was
more
connected
with
those
who
did
than
was
believed--
was
that
a
fact
inquired
mr
chillingworth--
you
shall
see
as
we
go
on
and
be
able
to
judge
for
yourself
i
have
thought
he
was
well
he
first
took
me
to
a
handsome
saloon
where
gambling
was
carried
on
we
had
been
to
the
opera
as
we
came
out
he
recommended
that
we
should
sup
at
a
house
where
he
was
well
known
and
where
he
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
his
evenings
after
the
opera
and
before
he
retired
i
agreed
to
this
i
saw
no
reason
why
i
should
not
we
went
there
and
bitterly
have
i
repented
of
so
doing
for
years
since
and
do
to
this
day--
your
repentance
has
been
sincere
and
lasting
said
mr
chillingworth
the
one
proves
the
other--it
does
but
i
thought
not
so
then
the
place
was
glittering
and
the
wine
good
it
was
a
kind
of
earthly
paradise
and
when
we
had
taken
some
wine
the
chevalier
said
to
me--
'i
am
desirous
of
seeing
a
friend
backwards
he
is
at
the
hazard-table
will
you
go
with
me'--i
hesitated
i
feared
to
see
the
place
where
a
vice
was
carried
on
i
knew
myself
inclined
to
prudential
motives
i
said
to
him--'no
st
john
i'll
wait
here
for
you
it
may
be
as
well--the
wine
is
good
and
it
will
content
me'
'do
so'
he
said
smiling
'but
remember
i
seldom
or
never
play
myself
nor
is
there
any
reason
why
you
should'--'i'll
go
but
i
will
not
play'--'certainly
not
you
are
free
alike
to
look
on
play
or
quit
the
place
at
any
moment
you
please
and
not
be
noticed
probably
by
a
single
soul'
i
arose
and
we
walked
backwards
having
called
one
of
the
men
who
were
waiting
about
but
who
were
watchers
and
door-keepers
of
the
'hell'
we
were
led
along
the
passage
and
passed
through
the
pair
of
doors
which
were
well
secured
and
rendered
the
possibility
of
a
surprise
almost
impossible
after
these
dark
places
we
were
suddenly
let
into
a
place
where
we
were
dazzled
by
the
light
and
brilliancy
of
the
saloon
it
was
not
so
large
as
the
one
we
left
but
it
was
superior
to
it
in
all
its
appointments
at
first
i
could
not
well
see
who
was
or
who
was
not
in
the
room
where
we
were
as
soon
however
as
i
found
the
use
of
my
eyes
i
noticed
many
well-dressed
men
who
were
busily
engaged
in
play
and
who
took
no
notice
of
any
one
who
entered
we
walked
about
for
some
minutes
without
speaking
to
any
one
but
merely
looking
on
i
saw
men
engaged
in
play
some
with
earnestness
others
again
with
great
nonchalance
and
money
changed
hands
without
the
least
remark
there
were
but
few
who
spoke
and
only
those
in
play
there
was
a
hum
of
conversation
but
you
could
not
distinguish
what
was
said
unless
you
paid
some
attention
to
and
was
in
close
vicinity
with
the
individual
who
spoke
'well'
said
st
john
'what
do
you
think
of
this
place'--'why'
i
replied
'i
had
no
notion
of
seeing
a
place
fitted
up
as
this
is'
'no
isn't
it
superb'--'it
is
beautifully
done
they
have
many
visitors'
said
i
'many
more
than
i
could
have
believed'
'yes
they
are
all
bona
fide
players
men
of
stamp
and
rank--none
of
your
seedy
legs
who
have
only
what
they
can
cheat
you
out
of'--'ah'--'and
besides'
he
added
'you
may
often
form
friendships
here
that
lead
to
fortune
hereafter
i
do
not
mean
in
play
because
there
is
no
necessity
for
your
doing
so
or
if
you
do
so
in
going
above
a
stake
which
you
know
won't
hurt
you'--'exactly'
'many
men
can
never
approach
a
table
like
this
and
sit
down
to
an
hour's
play
but
if
they
do
they
must
stake
not
only
more
than
they
can
afford
but
all
their
property
leaving
themselves
beggars'
'they
do
said
i
'but
men
who
know
themselves
their
resources
and
choose
to
indulge
for
a
time
may
often
come
and
lay
the
foundation
to
a
very
pretty
fortune'
'do
you
see
your
friend'
i
inquired--'no
i
do
not
but
i
will
inquire
if
he
has
been
here--if
not
we
will
go'
he
left
me
for
a
moment
or
two
to
make
some
inquiry
and
i
stood
looking
at
the
table
where
there
were
four
players
and
who
seemed
to
be
engaged
at
a
friendly
game
and
when
one
party
won
they
looked
grave
and
when
the
other
party
lost
they
smiled
and
looked
happy
i
walked
away
as
the
chevalier
did
not
return
immediately
to
me
and
then
i
saw
a
gentleman
rise
up
from
a
table
he
had
evidently
lost
i
was
standing
by
the
seat
unconsciously
holding
the
back
in
my
hand
i
sat
down
without
thinking
or
without
speaking
and
found
myself
at
the
hazard
table
'do
you
play
sir'--'yes'
i
said
i
had
hardly
uttered
the
words
when
i
was
sorry
for
them
but
i
could
not
recall
them
i
sat
down
and
play
at
once
commenced
in
about
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
often
losing
and
then
winning
i
found
myself
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
in
pocket
clear
gain
by
the
play
'ah'
said
the
chevalier
who
came
up
at
that
moment
'i
thought
you
wouldn't
play'--'i
really
don't
know
how
it
happened'
said
i
'but
i
suddenly
found
myself
here
without
any
previous
intention'
'you
are
not
a
loser
i
hope'--'indeed
i
am
not'
i
replied
'but
not
much
a
gainer'
'nor
need
you
desire
to
be
do
you
desire
to
give
your
adversary
his
revenge
now
or
take
another
opportunity'--'at
another
time'
i
replied
'you
will
find
me
here
the
day
after
to-morrow
when
i
shall
be
at
your
service'
then
bowing
he
turned
away
'he
is
a
very
rich
man
whom
you
have
been
playing
with'
said
the
chevalier--
indeed
'yes
and
i
have
known
him
to
lose
for
three
days
together
but
you
may
take
his
word
for
any
amount
he
is
a
perfect
gentleman
and
man
of
honour'--''tis
well
to
play
with
such'
i
replied
'but
i
suppose
you
are
about
to
leave'
'yes
it
grows
late
and
i
have
some
business
to
transact
to-morrow
so
i
must
leave'--'i
will
accompany
you
part
of
the
way
home'
said
i
'and
then
i
shall
have
finished
the
night'
i
did
leave
with
him
and
accompanied
him
home
and
then
walked
to
my
own
home





this
was
my
first
visit
and
i
thought
a
propitious
beginning
but
it
was
the
more
dangerous
perhaps
a
loss
might
have
effectually
deterred
me
but
it
is
doubtful
to
tell
how
certain
events
might
have
been
altered
it
is
just
possible
that
i
might
have
been
urged
on
by
my
desire
to
retrieve
any
loss
i
might
have
incurred
and
so
made
myself
at
once
the
miserable
being
it
took
months
to
accomplish
in
bringing
me
to
i
went
the
day
but
one
after
this
to
meet
the
same
individual
at
the
gambling-table
and
played
some
time
with
varied
success
until
i
left
off
with
a
trifling
loss
upon
the
night's
play
which
was
nothing
of
any
consequence
illustration
thus
matters
went
on
i
sometimes
won
and
sometimes
lost
until
i
won
a
few
hundreds
and
this
determined
me
to
play
for
higher
stakes
than
any
i
had
yet
played
for
it
was
no
use
going
on
in
the
peddling
style
i
had
been
going
on
i
had
won
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
in
three
months
and
had
i
been
less
fearful
i
might
have
had
twenty-five
thousand
pounds
ah
i'll
try
my
fortune
at
a
higher
game
having
once
made
this
resolution
i
was
anxious
to
begin
my
new
plan
which
i
hoped
would
have
the
effect
of
placing
me
far
above
my
then
present
position
in
society
which
was
good
and
with
a
little
attention
it
would
have
made
me
an
independent
man
but
then
it
required
patience
and
nothing
more
however
the
other
method
was
so
superior
since
it
might
all
be
done
with
good
luck
in
a
few
months
ah
good
luck
how
uncertain
is
good
luck
how
changeful
is
fortune
how
soon
is
the
best
prospect
blighted
by
the
frosts
of
adversity
in
less
than
a
month
i
had
lost
more
than
i
could
pay
and
then
i
gambled
on
for
a
living
my
wife
had
but
one
child
her
first
and
only
one
an
infant
at
her
breast
but
there
was
a
change
came
over
her
for
one
had
come
over
me--a
fearful
one
it
was
too--one
not
only
in
manner
but
in
fortune
too
she
would
beg
me
to
come
home
early
to
attend
to
other
matters
and
leave
the
dreadful
life
i
was
then
leading
'lizzy'
said
i
'we
are
ruined'--'ruined'
she
exclaimed
and
staggered
back
until
she
fell
into
a
seat
'ruined'
'ay
ruined
it
is
a
short
word
but
expressive'--'no
no
we
are
not
ruined
i
know
what
you
mean
you
would
say
we
cannot
live
as
we
have
lived
we
must
retrench
and
so
we
will
right
willingly'
'you
must
retrench
most
wonderfully'
i
said
with
desperate
calmness
'for
the
murder
must
out'--'and
so
we
will
but
you
will
be
with
us
you
will
not
go
out
night
after
night
ruining
your
health
our
happiness
and
destroying
both
peace
and
prospects'
'no
no
lizzy
we
have
no
chance
of
recovering
ourselves
house
and
home--all
gone--all
all'--'my
god'
she
exclaimed
'ay
rail
on'
said
i
'you
have
cause
enough
but
no
matter--we
have
lost
all'--'how--how'
'it
is
useless
to
ask
how
i
have
done
and
there
is
an
end
of
the
matter
you
shall
know
more
another
day
we
must
leave
this
house
for
a
lodging'--'it
matters
little'
she
said
'all
may
be
won
again
if
you
will
but
say
you
will
quit
the
society
of
those
who
have
ruined
you'
'no
one'
said
i
'has
ruined
me
i
did
it
it
was
no
fault
of
any
one
else's
i
have
not
that
excuse'--'i
am
sure
you
can
recover'
'i
may
some
day
fortune
will
shower
her
favours
upon
me
and
i
live
on
in
that
expectation'--'you
cannot
mean
that
you
will
chance
the
gaming-table
for
i
am
sure
you
must
have
lost
all
there'
'i
have'--'god
help
me'
she
said
'you
have
done
your
child
a
wrong
but
you
may
repair
it
yet'
'never'--''tis
a
long
day
let
me
implore
you
on
my
knees
to
leave
this
place
and
adopt
some
other
mode
of
life
we
can
be
careful
a
little
will
do
and
we
shall
in
time
be
equal
to
and
better
than
what
we
have
been'
'we
never
can
save
by
chance'--'and
by
chance
we
never
shall'
she
replied
'if
you
will
exert
yourself
we
may
yet
retrieve
ourselves'
'and
exert
myself
i
will'--'and
quit
the
gaming-table'
'ask
me
to
make
no
promises'
said
i
'i
may
not
be
able
to
keep
them
therefore
ask
me
to
make
none'--'i
do
ask
you
beg
of
entreat
of
you
to
promise
and
solemnly
promise
me
that
you
will
leave
that
fearful
place
where
men
not
only
lose
all
their
goods
but
the
feelings
of
nature
also'
'say
no
more
lizzy
if
i
can
get
a
living
elsewhere
i
will
but
if
not
i
must
get
it
there'
she
seemed
to
be
cast
down
at
this
and
she
shed
tears
i
left
the
room
and
again
went
to
the
gambling-house
and
there
that
night
i
won
a
few
pounds
which
enabled
me
to
take
my
wife
and
child
away
from
the
house
they
had
so
long
lived
in
and
took
them
afterwards
to
a
miserable
place--one
room
where
indeed
there
were
a
few
articles
of
furniture
that
i
had
saved
from
the
general
wreck
of
my
own
property
she
took
things
much
less
to
heart
than
i
could
have
anticipated
she
seemed
cheerful
and
happy--she
endeavoured
to
make
my
home
as
comfortable
as
she
could
her
whole
endeavour
was
to
make
me
as
much
as
possible
forget
the
past
she
wanted
as
much
as
possible
to
wean
me
away
from
my
gambling
pursuits
but
that
was
impossible
i
had
no
hope
no
other
prospect
thus
she
strove
but
i
could
see
each
day
she
was
getting
paler
and
more
pale
her
figure
before
round
was
more
thin
and
betrayed
signs
of
emaciation
this
preyed
upon
me
and
when
fortune
denied
me
the
means
of
carrying
home
that
which
she
so
much
wanted
i
could
never
return
for
two
days
at
a
time
then
i
would
find
her
shedding
tears
and
sighing
what
could
i
say
if
i
had
anything
to
take
her
then
i
used
to
endeavour
to
make
her
forget
that
i
had
been
away
'ah'
she
would
exclaim
'you
will
find
me
dead
one
of
these
days
what
you
do
now
for
one
or
two
days
you
will
do
by-and-bye
for
many
days
perhaps
weeks'--'do
not
anticipate
evil'
'i
cannot
do
otherwise
were
you
in
any
other
kind
of
employment
but
that
of
gambling'
she
said
'i
should
have
some
hope
of
you
but
as
it
is
there
is
none'--'speak
not
of
it
my
chances
may
turn
out
favourable
yet
and
you
may
be
again
as
you
were'
'never'--'but
fortune
is
inconstant
and
may
change
in
my
favour
as
much
as
she
has
done
in
others'
'fortune
is
indeed
constant
but
misfortune
is
as
inconstant'--'you
are
prophetic
of
evil
'ah
i
would
to
heaven
i
could
predict
good
but
who
ever
yet
heard
of
a
ruined
gambler
being
able
to
retrieve
himself
by
the
same
means
that
he
was
ruined'
thus
we
used
to
converse
but
our
conversation
was
usually
of
but
little
comfort
to
either
of
us
for
we
could
give
neither
any
comfort
to
the
other
and
as
that
was
usually
the
case
our
interviews
became
less
frequent
and
of
less
duration
my
answer
was
always
the
same
'i
have
no
other
chance
my
prospects
are
limited
to
that
one
place
deprive
me
of
that
and
i
never
more
should
be
able
to
bring
you
a
mouthful
of
bread'
day
after
day--day
after
day
the
same
result
followed
and
i
was
as
far
from
success
as
ever
i
was
and
ever
should
be
i
was
yet
a
beggar
the
time
flew
by
my
little
girl
was
nearly
four
years
old
but
she
knew
not
the
misery
her
father
and
mother
had
to
endure
the
poor
little
thing
sometimes
went
without
more
than
a
meal
a
day
and
while
i
was
living
thus
upon
the
town
upon
the
chances
of
the
gaming-table
many
a
pang
did
she
cause
me
and
so
did
her
mother
my
constant
consolation
was
this--
'it
is
bad
luck
now'
i
would
say
'but
will
be
better
by-and-bye
things
cannot
always
continue
thus
it
is
all
for
them--all
for
them'
i
thought
that
by
continuing
constantly
in
one
course
i
must
be
at
land
at
the
ebb
of
the
tide
'it
cannot
always
flow
one
way'
i
thought
i
had
often
heard
people
say
that
if
you
could
but
have
the
resolution
to
play
on
you
must
in
the
end
seize
the
turn
of
fortune
'if
i
could
but
once
do
that
i
would
never
enter
a
hell
again
as
long
as
i
drew
breath'
this
was
a
resolve
i
could
not
only
make
but
keep
because
i
had
suffered
so
much
that
i
would
never
run
through
the
same
misery
again
that
i
had
already
gone
through
however
fortune
never
seemed
inclined
to
take
the
turn
i
had
hoped
for
fortune
was
as
far
off
as
ever
and
had
in
no
case
given
me
any
opportunity
of
recovering
myself
a
few
pounds
were
the
utmost
i
could
at
any
time
muster
and
i
had
to
keep
up
something
of
an
appearance
and
seem
as
if
i
had
a
thousand
a
year
when
god
knows
i
could
not
have
mustered
a
thousandth
part
of
that
sum
were
all
done
and
paid
for
day
after
day
passed
on
and
yet
no
change
i
had
almost
given
myself
up
to
despair
when
one
night
when
i
went
home
i
saw
my
wife
was
more
than
usually
melancholy
and
sad
and
perhaps
ill
i
didn't
look
at
her--i
seldom
did
because
her
looks
were
always
a
reproach
to
me
i
could
not
help
feeling
them
so
'well'
said
i
'i
have
come
home
to
you
because
i
have
something
to
bring
you
not
what
i
ought--but
what
i
can--you
must
be
satisfied'--'i
am'
she
said
'i
know
also
you
want
it
how
is
the
child
is
she
quite
well'--'yes
quite'
'where
is
she'
inquired
i
looking
round
the
room
but
i
didn't
see
her
she
used
to
be
up--'she
has
gone
to
bed'
she
said
'it
is
very
early'--'yes
but
she
cried
so
for
food
that
i
was
obliged
to
get
her
to
sleep
to
forget
her
hunger
poor
thing
she
has
wanted
bread
very
badly'
'poor
thing'
i
said
'let
her
be
awakened
and
partake
of
what
i
have
brought
home'
with
that
my
wife
waked
her
up
and
the
moment
she
opened
her
eyes
she
again
began
to
cry
for
food
which
i
immediately
gave
her
and
saw
her
devour
with
the
utmost
haste
and
hunger
the
sight
smote
my
heart
and
my
wife
sat
by
watching
and
endeavouring
to
prevent
her
from
eating
so
fast
'this
is
bad'
i
said--'yes
but
i
hope
it
may
be
the
worst'
she
replied
in
a
deep
and
hollow
voice
'lizzy'
i
exclaimed
'what
is
the
matter--are
you
ill'--'yes
very
ill'
'what
is
the
matter
with
you
for
god's
sake
tell
me'
i
said
for
i
was
alarmed--'i
am
very
ill'
she
said
'very
ill
indeed
i
feel
my
strength
decreasing
every
day
i
must
drink'
you
too
want
food'--'i
have
and
perhaps
do
though
the
desire
to
eat
seems
almost
to
have
left
me'
'for
heaven's
sake
eat'
said
i
'i
will
bring
you
home
something
more
by
to-morrow
eat
and
drink
lizzy
i
have
suffered
but
for
you
and
your
child's
sake
i
will
do
my
best'--'your
best'
she
said
'will
kill
us
both
but
alas
there
is
no
other
aid
at
hand
you
may
one
day
however
come
here
too
late
to
find
us
living'
'say
no
more
lizzy
you
know
not
my
feelings
when
you
speak
thus
alas
i
have
no
hope--no
aid--no
friend'--'no'
she
replied
'your
love
of
gaming
drove
them
from
you
because
they
would
not
aid
a
gambler'
'say
no
more
lizzy'
i
said
'if
there
be
not
an
end
to
this
life
soon
there
will
be
an
end
to
me
in
two
days
more
i
shall
return
to
you
good
bye
god
bless
you
keep
up
your
heart
and
the
child'--'good
bye'
she
said
sorrowfully
she
shed
tears
and
wrung
her
hands
bitterly
i
hastened
away--my
heart
was
ready
to
burst
and
i
could
not
speak
i
walked
about
to
recover
my
serenity
but
could
not
do
so
sufficiently
well
to
secure
anything
like
an
appearance
that
would
render
me
fit
to
go
to
the
gaming-house
that
night
i
remained
away
but
i
could
not
avoid
falling
into
a
debauch
to
drown
my
misfortunes
and
shift
the
scene
of
misery
that
was
continually
before
my
eyes





the
next
night
i
was
at
the
gaming-house
i
went
there
in
better
than
usual
spirits
i
saw
i
thought
a
change
in
fortune
and
hailed
that
as
the
propitious
moment
of
my
life
when
i
was
to
rise
above
my
present
misfortunes
i
played
and
won--played
and
lost--played
and
won
and
then
lost
again
thus
i
went
on
fluctuating
more
and
more
until
i
found
i
was
getting
money
in
my
pocket
i
had
at
one
moment
more
than
three
hundred
pounds
in
my
pocket
and
i
felt
that
then
was
my
happy
moment--then
the
tide
of
fortune
was
going
in
my
favour
i
ought
to
have
left
off
with
that--to
have
been
satisfied
with
such
an
amount
of
money
but
the
demon
of
avarice
seemed
to
have
possessed
me
and
i
went
on
and
on
with
fluctuating
fortune
until
i
lost
the
whole
of
it
i
was
mad--desperate
and
could
have
destroyed
myself
but
i
thought
of
the
state
my
wife
and
child
were
in
i
thought
that
that
night
they
would
want
food
but
they
could
not
hurt
for
one
day--they
must
have
some
or
would
procure
some
i
was
too
far
gone
to
be
able
to
go
to
them
even
if
i
were
possessed
of
means
but
i
had
none
and
daylight
saw
me
in
a
deep
sleep
from
which
i
awoke
not
until
the
next
evening
let
in
and
then
i
once
more
determined
that
i
would
make
a
desperate
attempt
to
get
a
little
money
i
had
always
paid
and
thought
my
word
would
be
taken
for
once
and
if
i
won
all
well
and
good
if
not
then
i
was
no
worse
off
than
before
this
was
easy
to
plan
but
not
to
execute
i
went
there
but
there
were
none
present
in
whom
i
had
sufficient
interest
to
dare
make
the
attempt
i
walked
about
and
felt
in
a
most
uncomfortable
state
i
feared
i
should
not
succeed
at
all
then
what
was
to
become
of
me--of
my
wife
and
child
this
rendered
me
almost
mad
i
could
not
understand
what
i
was
to
do
what
to
attempt
or
where
to
go
one
or
two
persons
came
up
and
asked
me
if
i
were
ill
my
answers
were
that
i
was
well
enough
good
god
how
far
from
the
truth
was
that
but
i
found
i
must
place
more
control
on
my
feelings
else
i
should
cause
much
conversation
and
then
i
should
lose
all
hope
of
recovering
myself
and
all
prospect
of
living
even
at
length
some
one
did
come
in
and
i
remarked
i
had
been
there
all
the
evening
and
had
not
played
i
had
an
invitation
to
play
with
him
which
ended
by
a
little
sleight
of
hand
in
my
favour
and
on
that
i
had
calculated
as
much
as
on
any
good
fortune
i
might
meet
the
person
i
played
with
observed
it
not
and
when
we
left
off
playing
i
had
some
six
or
seven
pounds
in
pocket
this
to
me
was
a
very
great
sum
and
the
moment
i
could
decently
withdraw
myself
i
ran
off
home
i
was
fearful
of
the
scene
that
awaited
me
i
expected
something
worse
than
i
had
yet
seen
possibly
lizzy
might
be
angry
and
scold
as
well
as
complain
i
therefore
tapped
at
the
door
gently
but
heard
no
one
answer
but
of
this
i
took
no
notice
as
i
believed
that
they
might
be
and
were
most
probably
fast
asleep
i
had
provided
myself
with
a
light
and
i
therefore
opened
the
door
which
was
not
fastened
'lizzy'
said
i
'lizzy'
there
was
no
answer
given
and
i
paused
everything
was
as
still
as
death
i
looked
on
the
bed--there
lay
my
wife
with
her
clothes
on
'lizzy
lizzy'
said
i
but
still
she
did
not
answer
me
'well'
said
i
'she
sleeps
sound'
and
i
walked
towards
the
bed
and
placed
my
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
began
to
shake
her
saying
as
i
did
so--
'lizzy
lizzy
i'm
come
home'
but
still
no
answer
or
signs
of
awaking
i
went
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
to
look
at
her
face
and
some
misgivings
overtook
me
i
trembled
much
she
lay
on
the
bed
with
her
back
towards
the
spot
where
i
stood
i
came
towards
her
face
my
hand
shook
violently
as
i
endeavoured
to
look
at
her
she
had
her
eyes
wide
open
as
if
staring
at
me
'lizzy'
said
i
no
answer
was
returned
i
then
placed
my
hand
upon
her
cheek
it
was
enough
and
i
started
back
in
great
horror
she
was
dead
this
was
horror
itself
i
staggered
back
and
fell
into
a
chair
the
light
i
placed
down
heaven
knows
how
or
why
but
there
i
sat
staring
at
the
corpse
of
my
unfortunate
wife
i
can
hardly
tell
you
the
tremendous
effect
this
had
upon
me
i
could
not
move
i
was
fascinated
to
the
spot
i
could
not
move
and
could
not
turn





it
was
morning
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
illumined
the
apartment
but
there
sat
i
still
gazing
upon
the
face
of
my
unfortunate
wife
i
saw
i
knew
she
was
dead
but
yet
i
had
not
spoken
but
sat
looking
at
her
i
believe
my
heart
was
as
cold
as
she
was
but
extreme
horror
and
dread
had
dried
up
all
the
warm
blood
in
my
body
and
i
hardly
think
there
was
a
pulsation
left
the
thoughts
of
my
child
never
once
seemed
to
cross
my
mind
i
had
however
sat
there
long--some
hours
before
i
was
discovered
and
this
was
by
the
landlady
i
had
left
the
door
open
behind
me
and
she
in
passing
down
had
the
curiosity
to
peep
and
saw
me
sitting
in
what
she
thought
to
be
a
very
strange
attitude
and
could
hear
no
sounds
after
some
time
she
discovered
my
wife
was
dead
and
for
some
time
she
thought
me
so
too
however
she
was
convinced
to
the
contrary
and
then
began
to
call
for
assistance
this
awoke
the
child
which
was
nearly
famished
the
landlady
to
become
useful
and
to
awaken
me
from
my
lethargy
placed
the
child
in
my
hands
telling
me
i
was
the
best
person
now
to
take
care
of
it
and
so
i
was
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
truth
of
that
and
i
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
it
i
felt
much
pride
and
pleasure
in
my
daughter
and
determined
she
should
if
i
starved
have
the
benefit
of
all
i
could
do
for
her
in
the
way
of
care
c





the
funeral
over
i
took
my
child
and
carried
it
to
a
school
where
i
left
her
and
paid
in
advance
promising
to
do
so
as
often
as
the
quarter
came
round
my
wife
i
had
seen
buried
by
the
hands
of
man
and
i
swore
i
would
do
the
best
for
my
child
and
to
keep
this
oath
was
a
work
of
pleasure
i
determined
also
i
would
never
more
enter
a
gaming-house
be
the
extremity
what
it
might
i
would
suffer
even
death
before
i
would
permit
myself
to
enter
the
house
in
which
it
took
place
'i
will'
i
thought
'obtain
some
employment
of
some
kind
or
other
i
could
surely
obtain
that
i
have
only
to
ask
and
i
have
it
surely--something
however
menial
that
would
keep
me
and
my
child
yes
yes--she
ought
she
must
have
her
charges
paid
at
once
the
effect
of
my
wife's
death
was
a
very
great
shock
to
me
and
such
a
one
i
could
not
forget--one
i
shall
ever
remember
and
one
that
at
least
made
a
lasting
impression
upon
me





strange
but
true
i
never
entered
a
gambling-house
it
was
my
horror
and
my
aversion
and
yet
i
could
obtain
no
employment
i
took
my
daughter
and
placed
her
at
a
boarding-school
and
tried
hard
to
obtain
bread
by
labour
but
do
what
would
none
could
be
had
if
my
soul
depended
upon
it
i
could
find
none
i
cared
not
what
it
was--anything
that
was
honest
i
was
reduced
low--very
low
gaunt
starvation
showed
itself
in
my
cheeks
but
i
wandered
about
to
find
employment
none
could
be
found
and
the
world
seemed
to
have
conspired
together
to
throw
me
back
to
the
gaming-table
but
this
i
would
not
at
last
employment
was
offered
but
what
was
it
the
situation
of
common
hangman
was
offered
me
the
employment
was
disgusting
and
horrible
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
all
i
could
get
and
that
was
a
sufficient
inducement
for
me
to
accept
of
it
i
was
therefore
the
common
executioner
and
in
that
employment
for
some
time
earned
a
living
it
was
terrible
but
necessity
compelled
me
to
accept
the
only
thing
i
could
obtain
you
now
know
the
reason
why
i
became
what
i
have
told
you
the
visit
of
the
vampire--the
general
meeting
illustration
the
mysterious
friend
of
mr
chillingworth
finished
his
narrative
and
then
the
doctor
said
to
him--
and
that
then
is
the
real
cause
why
you
a
man
evidently
far
above
the
position
of
life
which
is
usually
that
of
those
who
occupy
the
dreadful
post
of
executioner
came
to
accept
of
it--the
real
reason
sir
i
considered
too
that
in
holding
such
a
humiliating
situation
that
i
was
justly
served
for
the
barbarity
of
which
i
had
been
guilty
for
what
can
be
a
greater
act
of
cruelty
than
to
squander
as
i
did
in
the
pursuit
of
mad
excitement
those
means
which
should
have
rendered
my
home
happy
and
conduced
to
the
welfare
of
those
who
were
dependant
upon
me
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
your
self-reproaches
are
unjust
altogether
but--what
noise
is
that
do
you
hear
anything--
yes--yes
what
do
you
take
it
to
be--it
seemed
like
the
footsteps
of
a
number
of
persons
and
it
evidently
approaches
nearer
and
nearer
i
know
not
what
to
think
shall
i
tell
you
said
a
deep-toned
voice
and
some
one
through
the
orifice
in
the
back
of
the
summer-house
which
it
will
be
recollected
sustained
some
damage
at
the
time
that
varney
escaped
from
it
laid
a
hand
upon
mr
chillingworth's
shoulder
god
bless
me
exclaimed
the
doctor
who's
that
and
he
sprang
from
his
seat
with
the
greatest
perturbation
in
the
world
varney
the
vampyre
added
the
voice
and
then
both
the
doctor
and
his
companion
recognised
it
and
saw
the
strange
haggard
features
that
now
they
knew
so
well
confronting
them
there
was
a
pause
of
surprise
for
a
moment
or
two
on
the
part
of
the
doctor
and
then
he
said
sir
francis
varney
what
brings
you
here
i
conjure
you
to
tell
me
in
the
name
of
common
justice
and
common
feeling
what
brings
you
to
this
house
so
frequently
you
have
dispossessed
the
family
whose
property
it
is
of
it
and
you
have
caused
great
confusion
and
dismay
over
a
whole
county
i
implore
you
now
not
in
the
language
of
menace
or
as
an
enemy
but
as
the
advocate
of
the
oppressed
and
one
who
desires
to
see
justice
done
to
all
to
tell
me
what
it
is
you
require
there
is
no
time
now
for
explanation
said
varney
if
explanations
were
my
full
and
free
intent
you
wished
to
know
what
noise
was
that
you
heard
i
did
can
you
inform
me--i
can
the
wild
and
lawless
mob
which
you
and
your
friends
first
induced
to
interfere
in
affairs
far
beyond
their
or
your
control
are
now
flushed
with
the
desire
of
riot
and
of
plunder
the
noise
you
hear
is
that
of
their
advancing
footsteps
they
come
to
destroy
bannerworth
hall
can
that
be
possible
the
bannerworth
family
are
the
sufferers
from
all
that
has
happened
and
not
the
inflictors
of
suffering--ay
be
it
so
but
he
who
once
raises
a
mob
has
raised
an
evil
spirit
which
in
the
majority
of
cases
it
requires
a
far
more
potent
spell
than
he
is
master
of
to
quell
again
it
is
so
that
is
a
melancholy
truth
but
you
address
me
sir
francis
varney
as
if
i
led
on
the
mob
when
in
reality
i
have
done
all
that
lay
in
my
power
from
the
very
first
moment
of
their
rising
on
account
of
this
affair
which
in
the
first
instance
was
your
work
to
prevent
them
from
proceeding
to
acts
of
violence--it
may
be
so
but
if
you
have
now
any
regard
for
your
own
safety
you
will
quit
this
place
it
will
too
soon
become
the
scene
of
a
bloody
contention
a
large
party
of
dragoons
are
even
now
by
another
route
coming
towards
it
and
it
will
be
their
duty
to
resist
the
aggressions
of
the
mob
then
should
the
rioters
persevere
you
can
guess
the
result--i
can
indeed
retire
then
while
you
may
and
against
the
bad
deeds
of
sir
francis
varney
at
all
events
place
some
of
his
good
ones
that
he
may
not
seem
wholly
without
one
redeeming
trait--i
am
not
accustomed
said
the
doctor
to
paint
the
devil
blacker
than
he
really
is
but
yet
the
cruel
persecutions
that
the
bannerworth
family
have
endured
call
aloud
for
justice
you
still
with
a
perseverance
which
shows
you
regardless
of
what
others
suffer
so
that
you
compass
your
own
ends
hover
round
a
spot
which
you
have
rendered
desolate
hark
sir
do
you
not
hear
the
tramp
of
horses'
feet--i
do
the
noise
made
by
the
feet
of
the
insurgents
was
now
almost
drowned
in
the
louder
and
more
rapid
tramp
of
the
horses'
feet
of
the
advancing
dragoons
and
in
a
few
moments
more
sir
francis
varney
waved
his
arm
exclaiming--
they
are
here
will
you
not
consult
your
safety
by
flight--no
said
mr
chillingworth's
companion
we
prefer
remaining
here
at
the
risk
even
of
whatever
danger
may
accrue
to
us
fools
would
you
die
in
a
chance
melee
between
an
infuriated
populace
and
soldiery--do
not
leave
whispered
the
ex-hangman
to
mr
chillingworth
do
not
leave
i
pray
you
he
only
wants
to
have
the
hall
to
himself
there
could
be
no
doubt
now
of
the
immediate
appearance
of
the
cavalry
and
before
sir
francis
varney
could
utter
another
word
a
couple
of
the
foremost
of
the
soldiers
cleared
the
garden
fence
at
a
part
where
it
was
low
and
alighted
not
many
feet
from
the
summer-house
in
which
this
short
colloquy
was
taking
place
sir
francis
varney
uttered
a
bitter
oath
and
immediately
disappeared
in
the
gloom
what
shall
we
do
said
the
hangman--you
can
do
what
you
like
but
i
shall
avow
my
presence
to
the
military
and
claim
to
be
on
their
side
in
the
approaching
contest
if
it
should
come
to
one
which
i
sincerely
hope
it
will
not
the
military
detachment
consisted
of
about
twenty-five
dragoons
who
now
were
all
in
the
gardens
an
order
was
given
by
the
officer
in
command
for
them
to
dismount
which
was
at
once
obeyed
and
the
horses
were
fastened
by
their
bridles
to
the
various
trees
with
which
the
place
abounded
they
are
going
to
oppose
the
mob
on
foot
with
their
carbines
said
the
hangman
there
will
be
sad
work
here
i
am
afraid--well
at
all
events
said
mr
chillingworth
i
shall
decline
acting
the
part
of
a
spy
here
any
longer
so
here
goes
hilloa
a
friend--a
friend
here
in
the
summer-house
make
it
two
friends
cried
the
hangman
if
you
please
while
you
are
about
it
a
couple
of
the
dragoons
immediately
appeared
and
the
doctor
with
his
companion
were
marched
as
prisoners
before
the
officer
in
command
what
do
you
do
here
he
said
i
was
informed
that
the
hall
was
deserted
here
orderly
where
is
mr
adamson
the
magistrate
who
came
with
me--close
at
hand
sir
and
he
says
he's
not
well
well
or
ill
he
must
come
here
and
do
something
with
these
people
a
magistrate
of
the
district
who
had
accompanied
the
troops
and
been
accommodated
with
a
seat
behind
one
of
the
dragoons
which
seemed
very
much
to
have
disagreed
with
him
for
he
was
as
pale
as
death
now
stepped
forward
you
know
me
mr
adamson
said
the
doctor
i
am
mr
chillingworth--oh
yes
lord
bless
you
how
came
you
here
never
mind
that
just
now
you
can
vouch
for
my
having
no
connection
with
the
rioters--oh
dear
yes
certainly
this
is
a
respectable
gentleman
captain
richardson
and
a
personal
friend
of
mine
oh
very
good--and
i
said
the
doctor's
companion
am
likewise
a
respectable
and
useful
member
of
society
and
a
great
friend
of
mr
chillingworth
well
gentlemen
said
the
captain
in
command
you
may
remain
here
if
you
like
and
take
the
chances
or
you
may
leave
they
intimated
that
they
preferred
remaining
and
almost
at
the
moment
that
they
did
so
a
loud
shout
from
many
throats
announced
the
near
approach
of
the
mob--now
mr
magistrate
if
you
please
said
the
officer
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
tell
the
mob
that
i
am
here
with
my
troop
under
your
orders
and
strongly
advise
them
to
be
off
while
they
can
with
whole
skins
for
if
they
persevere
in
attacking
the
place
we
must
persevere
in
defending
it
and
if
they
have
half
a
grain
of
sense
among
them
they
can
surely
guess
what
the
result
of
that
will
be
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
as
heaven
is
my
judge
said
the
magistrate
to
produce
a
peaceable
recall--more
no
man
can
do
hurrah
hurrah'
shouted
the
mob
down
with
the
vampyre
down
with
the
hall
and
then
one
more
candid
than
his
fellows
shouted--down
with
everything
and
everybody
ah
remarked
the
officer
that
fellow
now
knows
what
he
came
about
a
great
number
of
torches
and
links
were
lighted
by
the
mob
but
the
moment
the
glare
of
light
fell
upon
the
helmets
and
accoutrements
of
the
military
there
was
a
pause
of
consternation
on
the
part
of
the
multitude
and
mr
adamson
urged
on
by
the
officer
who
it
was
evident
by
no
means
liked
the
service
he
was
on
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
stepping
forward
he
said--
my
good
people
and
fellow
townsmen
let
me
implore
you
to
listen
to
reason
and
go
to
your
homes
in
peace
if
you
do
not
but
on
the
contrary
in
defiance
of
law
and
good
order
persist
in
attacking
this
house
it
will
become
my
painful
duty
to
read
the
riot
act
and
then
the
military
and
you
will
have
to
fight
it
out
together
which
i
beg
you
will
avoid
for
you
know
that
some
of
you
will
be
killed
and
a
lot
more
of
you
receive
painful
wounds
now
disperse
let
me
beg
of
you
at
once
there
seemed
for
a
moment
a
disposition
among
the
mob
to
give
up
the
contest
but
there
were
others
among
them
who
were
infuriated
with
drink
and
so
regardless
of
all
consequences
those
set
up
a
shout
of
down
with
the
red
coats
we
are
englishmen
and
will
do
what
we
like
some
one
then
threw
a
heavy
stone
which
struck
one
of
the
soldiers
and
brought
blood
from
his
cheek
the
officer
saw
it
but
he
said
at
once--
stand
firm
now
stand
firm
no
anger--steady
twenty
pounds
for
the
man
who
threw
that
stone
said
the
magistrate--twenty
pound
ten
for
old
adamson
the
magistrate
cried
a
voice
in
the
crowd
which
no
doubt
came
from
him
who
had
cast
the
missile
then
at
least
fifty
stones
were
thrown
some
of
which
hit
the
magistrate
and
the
remainder
came
rattling
upon
the
helmets
of
the
dragoons
like
a
hail
shower
i
warn
you
and
beg
of
you
to
go
said
mr
adamson
for
the
sake
of
your
wives
and
families
i
beg
of
you
not
to
pursue
this
desperate
game
loud
cries
now
arose
of
down
with
the
soldiers
down
with
the
vampyre
he's
in
bannerworth
hall
smoke
him
out
and
then
one
or
two
links
were
hurled
among
the
dismounted
dragoons
all
this
was
put
up
with
patiently
and
then
again
the
mob
were
implored
to
leave
which
being
answered
by
fresh
taunts
the
magistrate
proceeded
to
read
the
riot
act
not
one
word
of
which
was
audible
amid
the
tumult
that
prevailed
put
out
all
the
lights
cried
a
voice
among
the
mob
the
order
was
obeyed
and
the
same
voice
added
they
dare
not
fire
on
us
come
on
and
a
rush
was
made
at
the
garden
wall
make
ready--present
cried
the
officer
and
then
he
added
in
an
under
tone
above
their
heads
now--fire
there
was
a
blaze
of
light
for
a
moment
a
stunning
noise
a
shout
of
dismay
from
the
mob
and
in
another
moment
all
was
still
there
said
dr
chillingworth
that
this
is
at
all
events
a
bloodless
victory
you
may
depend
upon
that
said
his
companion
but
is
not
there
some
one
yet
remaining
look
there
do
you
not
see
a
figure
clambering
over
the
fence
yes
i
do
indeed
ah
they
have
him
a
prisoner
at
all
events
those
two
dragoons
have
him
fast
enough
we
shall
now
perhaps
hear
from
this
fellow
who
is
the
actual
ringleader
in
such
an
affair
which
but
for
the
pusillanimity
of
the
mob
might
have
turned
out
to
be
really
most
disastrous
it
was
strange
how
one
man
should
think
it
expedient
to
attack
the
military
post
after
the
mob
had
been
so
completely
routed
at
the
first
discharge
of
fire-arms
but
so
it
was
one
man
did
make
an
attempt
to
enter
the
garden
and
it
was
so
rapid
and
so
desperate
an
one
that
he
rather
seemed
to
throw
himself
bodily
at
the
fence
which
separated
it
from
the
meadows
without
than
to
clamber
over
it
as
any
one
under
ordinary
circumstances
who
might
wish
to
effect
an
entrance
by
that
means
would
have
done
he
was
no
sooner
however
perceived
than
a
couple
of
the
dismounted
soldiers
stepped
forward
and
made
a
prisoner
of
him
good
god
exclaimed
mr
chillingworth
as
they
approached
nearer
with
him
good
god
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
do
my
eyes
deceive
me
or
are
they
indeed
so
blessed
blessed
by
what
exclaimed
the
hangman
by
a
sight
of
the
long
lost
deeply
regretted
charles
holland
charles--charles
is
that
indeed
you
or
some
unsubstantial
form
in
your
likeness
charles
holland
for
it
was
indeed
himself
heard
the
friendly
voice
of
the
doctor
and
he
called
out
to
him
speak
to
me
of
flora
oh
speak
to
me
of
flora
if
you
would
not
have
me
die
at
once
of
suspense
and
all
the
torture
of
apprehension
she
lives
and
is
well
thank
heaven
do
with
me
what
you
please
dr
chillingworth
sprang
forward
and
addressing
the
magistrate
he
said--
sir
i
know
this
gentleman
he
is
no
one
of
the
rioters
but
a
dear
friend
of
the
family
of
the
bannerworths
charles
holland
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
had
become
of
you
so
long
and
what
brought
you
here
at
such
a
juncture
as
this
i
am
faint
said
charles
i--i
only
arrived
as
the
crowd
did
i
had
not
strength
to
fight
my
way
through
them
and
was
compelled
to
pause
until
they
had
dispersed
can--can
you
give
me
water
here's
something
better
said
one
of
the
soldiers
as
he
handed
a
flask
to
charles
who
partook
of
some
of
the
contents
which
greatly
revived
him
indeed
i
am
better
now
he
said
thank
you
kindly
take
me
into
the
house
good
god
why
is
it
made
a
point
of
attack
where
are
flora
and
henry
are
they
all
well
and
my
uncle
oh
what
must
you
all
have
thought
of
my
absence
but
you
cannot
have
endured
a
hundredth
part
of
what
i
have
suffered
let
me
look
once
again
upon
the
face
of
flora
take
me
into
the
house
release
him
said
the
officer
as
he
pointed
to
his
head
and
looked
significantly
as
much
as
to
say
some
mad
patient
of
yours
i
suppose
you
are
much
mistaken
sir
said
dr
chillingworth
this
gentleman
has
been
cruelly
used
i
have
no
doubt
he
has
i
am
inclined
to
believe
been
made
the
victim
for
a
time
of
the
intrigues
of
that
very
sir
francis
varney
whose
conduct
has
been
the
real
cause
of
all
the
serious
disturbances
that
have
taken
place
in
the
country
confound
sir
francis
varney
muttered
the
officer
he
is
enough
to
set
a
whole
nation
by
the
ears
however
mr
magistrate
if
you
are
satisfied
that
this
young
man
is
not
one
of
the
rioters
i
have
of
course
no
wish
to
hold
him
a
prisoner
i
can
take
mr
chillingworth's
word
for
more
than
that
said
the
magistrate
charles
holland
was
accordingly
released
and
then
the
doctor
in
hurried
accents
told
him
the
principal
outlines
of
what
had
occurred
oh
take
me
to
flora
he
said
let
me
not
delay
another
moment
in
seeking
her
and
convincing
her
that
i
could
not
have
been
guilty
of
the
baseness
of
deserting
her
hark
you
mr
holland
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
that
i
will
not
leave
bannerworth
hall
yet
but
you
can
go
alone
and
easily
find
them
by
the
directions
which
i
will
give
you
only
let
me
beg
of
you
not
to
go
abruptly
into
the
presence
of
flora
she
is
in
an
extremely
delicate
state
of
health
and
although
i
do
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
a
shock
of
a
pleasurable
nature
would
prove
of
any
paramount
bad
consequence
to
her
yet
it
is
as
well
not
to
risk
it
i
will
be
most
careful
you
may
depend
at
this
moment
there
was
a
loud
ringing
at
the
garden
bell
and
when
it
was
answered
by
one
of
the
dragoons
who
was
ordered
to
do
so
by
his
officer
he
came
back
escorting
no
other
than
jack
pringle
who
had
been
sent
by
the
admiral
to
the
hall
but
who
had
solaced
himself
so
much
on
the
road
with
divers
potations
that
he
did
not
reach
it
till
now
which
was
a
full
hour
after
the
reasonable
time
in
which
he
ought
to
have
gone
the
distance
illustration
jack
was
not
to
say
dumb
but
he
had
had
enough
to
give
him
a
very
jolly
sort
of
feeling
of
independence
and
so
he
came
along
quarrelling
with
the
soldier
all
the
way
the
latter
only
laughing
and
keeping
his
temper
admirably
well
under
a
great
deal
of
provocation
why
you
land
lubbers
cried
jack
what
do
you
do
here
all
of
you
i
wonder
you
are
all
wamphighers
i'll
be
bound
every
one
of
you
you
mind
me
of
marines
you
do
and
that's
quite
enough
to
turn
a
proper
seaman's
stomach
any
day
in
the
week
the
soldier
only
laughed
and
brought
jack
up
to
the
little
group
of
persons
consisting
of
dr
chillingworth
the
hangman
charles
holland
and
the
officer
why
jack
pringle
said
dr
chillingworth
stepping
before
charles
so
that
jack
should
not
see
him--why
jack
pringle
what
brings
you
here
a
slight
squall
sir
to
the
nor'west
brought
you
something
to
eat
jack
produced
a
bottle
to
drink
you
mean
well
it's
all
one
only
in
this
here
shape
you
see
it
goes
down
better
i'm
thinking
which
does
make
a
little
difference
somehow
how
is
the
admiral
oh
he's
as
stupid
as
ever
lord
bless
you
he'd
be
like
a
ship
without
a
rudder
without
me
and
would
go
swaying
about
at
the
mercy
of
winds
and
waves
poor
old
man
he's
bad
enough
as
it
is
but
if
so
be
i
wasn't
to
give
the
eye
to
him
as
i
does
bless
my
heart
if
i
thinks
as
he'd
be
above
hatches
long
here's
to
you
all
jack
took
the
cork
from
the
bottle
he
had
with
him
and
there
came
from
it
a
strong
odour
of
rum
then
he
placed
it
to
his
lips
and
was
enjoying
the
pleasant
gurgle
of
the
liquor
down
his
throat
when
charles
stepped
up
to
him
and
laying
hold
of
the
lower
end
of
the
bottle
he
dragged
it
from
his
mouth
saying--
how
dare
you
talk
in
the
way
you
have
of
my
uncle
you
drunken
mutinous
rascal
and
behind
his
back
too
the
voice
of
charles
holland
was
as
well
known
to
jack
pringle
as
that
of
the
admiral
and
his
intense
astonishment
at
hearing
himself
so
suddenly
addressed
by
one
of
whose
proximity
he
had
not
the
least
idea
made
some
of
the
rum
go
what
is
popularly
termed
the
wrong
way
and
nearly
choked
him
he
reeled
back
till
he
fell
over
some
obstruction
and
then
down
he
sat
on
a
flower
bed
while
his
eyes
seemed
ready
to
come
out
of
his
head
avast
heavings
he
cried
who's
that
come
come
said
charles
holland
don't
pretend
you
don't
know
me
i
will
not
have
my
uncle
spoken
of
in
a
disrespectful
manner
by
you
well
shiver
my
timbers
if
that
ain't
our
nevey
why
charley
my
boy
how
are
you
here
we
are
in
port
at
last
won't
the
old
commodore
pipe
his
eye
now
whew
here's
a
go
i've
found
our
nevey
after
all
you
found
him
said
dr
chillingworth
now
that
is
as
great
a
piece
of
impudence
as
ever
i
heard
in
all
my
life
you
mean
that
he
has
found
you
and
found
you
out
too
you
drunken
fellow
jack
you
get
worse
and
worse
every
day
ay
ay
sir
what
you
admit
it
ay
ay
sir
now
master
charley
i
tell
you
what
it
is
i
shall
take
you
off
to
your
old
uncle
you
shore
going
sneak
and
you'll
have
to
report
what
cruise
you've
been
upon
all
this
while
leaving
the
ship
to
look
after
itself
lord
love
you
all
if
it
hadn't
been
for
me
i
don't
know
what
anybody
would
have
done
i
only
know
of
the
result
said
dr
chillingworth
that
would
ensue
if
it
were
not
for
you
and
that
would
consist
in
a
great
injury
to
the
revenue
in
consequence
of
the
much
less
consumption
of
rum
and
other
strong
liquors
i'll
be
hanged
up
at
the
yard
if
i
understands
what
you
mean
said
jack
as
if
i
ever
drunk
anything--i
of
all
people
in
the
world
i
am
ashamed
of
you
you
are
drunk
several
of
the
dragoons
had
to
turn
aside
to
keep
themselves
from
laughing
and
the
officer
himself
could
not
forbear
from
a
smile
as
he
said
to
the
doctor--
sir
you
seem
to
have
many
acquaintances
and
by
some
means
or
another
they
all
have
an
inclination
to
come
here
to-night
if
however
you
consider
that
you
are
bound
to
remain
here
from
a
feeling
that
the
hall
is
threatened
with
any
danger
you
may
dismiss
that
fear
for
i
shall
leave
a
picquet
here
all
night
no
sir
replied
dr
chillingworth
it
is
not
that
i
fear
now
after
the
manner
in
which
they
have
been
repulsed
any
danger
to
the
hall
from
the
mob
but
i
have
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
in
it
or
near
it
for
some
time
to
come
as
you
please
charles
do
not
wait
for
or
accept
the
guidance
of
that
drunken
fellow
but
go
yourself
with
a
direction
which
i
will
write
down
for
you
in
a
leaf
of
my
pocket-book
drunken
fellow
exclaimed
jack
who
had
now
scrambled
to
his
feet
who
do
you
call
a
drunken
fellow
why
you
unquestionably
well
now
that
is
hard
come
along
nevey
i'll
shew
you
where
they
all
are
i
could
walk
a
plank
on
any
deck
with
any
man
in
the
service
i
could
come
along
my
boy
come
along
you
can
accept
of
him
as
a
guide
if
you
like
of
course
said
the
doctor
he
may
be
sober
enough
to
conduct
you
i
think
he
can
said
charles
lead
on
jack
but
mark
me
i
shall
inform
my
uncle
of
this
intemperance
as
well
as
of
the
manner
in
which
you
let
your
tongue
wag
about
him
behind
his
back
unless
you
promise
to
reform
he
is
long
past
all
reformation
remarked
dr
chillingworth
it
is
out
of
the
question
and
i
am
afraid
my
uncle
will
not
have
courage
to
attempt
such
an
ungrateful
task
when
there
is
so
little
chance
of
success
replied
charles
holland
shaking
the
worthy
doctor
by
the
hand
farewell
for
the
present
sir
the
next
time
i
see
you
i
hope
we
shall
both
be
more
pleasantly
situated
come
along
nevey
interrupted
jack
pringle
now
you've
found
your
way
back
the
first
thing
you
ought
to
do
is
to
report
yourself
as
having
come
aboard
follow
me
and
i'll
soon
show
yer
the
port
where
the
old
hulk's
laid
hisself
up
jack
walked
on
first
tolerably
steady
if
one
may
take
into
account
his
divers
deep
potations
and
charles
holland
anticipating
with
delight
again
looking
upon
the
face
of
his
much
loved
flora
followed
closely
behind
him
we
can
well
imagine
the
world
of
delightful
thoughts
that
came
crowding
upon
him
when
jack
after
rather
a
long
walk
announced
that
they
were
now
very
near
the
residence
of
the
object
of
his
soul's
adoration
we
trust
that
there
is
not
one
of
our
readers
who
for
one
moment
will
suppose
that
charles
holland
was
the
sort
of
man
to
leave
even
such
a
villain
and
double-faced
hypocrite
as
marchdale
to
starve
amid
the
gloomy
ruins
where
he
was
immured
far
from
charles's
intentions
was
any
such
thing
but
he
did
think
that
a
night
passed
there
with
no
other
company
than
his
own
reflections
would
do
him
a
world
of
good
and
was
at
all
events
no
very
great
modicum
of
punishment
for
the
rascality
with
which
he
had
behaved
besides
even
during
that
night
there
were
refreshments
in
the
shape
of
bread
and
water
such
as
had
been
presented
to
charles
himself
within
marchdale's
reach
as
they
had
been
within
his
that
individual
now
charles
thought
would
have
a
good
opportunity
of
testing
the
quality
of
that
kind
of
food
and
of
finding
out
what
an
extremely
light
diet
it
was
for
a
strong
man
to
live
upon
but
in
the
morning
it
was
charles's
intention
to
take
henry
bannerworth
and
the
admiral
with
him
to
the
ruins
and
then
and
there
release
the
wretch
from
his
confinement
on
condition
that
he
made
a
full
confession
of
his
villanies
before
those
persons
oh
how
gladly
would
marchdale
have
exchanged
the
fate
which
actually
befell
him
for
any
amount
of
personal
humiliation
always
provided
that
it
brought
with
it
a
commensurate
amount
of
personal
safety
but
that
fate
was
one
altogether
undreamt
of
by
charles
holland
and
wholly
without
his
control
it
was
a
fate
which
would
have
been
his
but
for
the
murderous
purpose
which
had
brought
marchdale
to
the
dungeon
and
those
happy
accidents
which
had
enabled
charles
to
change
places
with
him
and
breathe
the
free
cool
fresh
air
while
he
left
his
enemy
loaded
with
the
same
chains
that
had
encumbered
his
limbs
so
cruelly
and
lying
on
that
same
damp
dungeon
floor
which
he
thought
would
be
his
grave
we
mentioned
that
as
charles
left
the
ruins
the
storm
which
had
been
giving
various
indications
of
its
coming
seemed
to
be
rapidly
approaching
it
was
one
of
these
extremely
local
tempests
which
expend
all
their
principal
fury
over
a
small
space
of
country
and
in
this
instance
the
space
seemed
to
include
little
more
than
the
river
and
the
few
meadows
which
immediately
surrounded
it
and
lent
it
so
much
of
its
beauty
marchdale
soon
found
that
his
cries
were
drowned
by
the
louder
voices
of
the
elements
the
wailing
of
the
wind
among
the
ancient
ruins
was
much
more
full
of
sound
than
his
cries
and
now
and
then
the
full-mouthed
thunder
filled
the
air
with
such
a
volume
of
roaring
and
awakened
so
many
echoes
among
the
ruins
that
had
he
possessed
the
voices
of
fifty
men
he
could
not
have
hoped
to
wage
war
with
it
and
then
although
we
know
that
charles
holland
would
have
encountered
death
himself
rather
than
he
would
have
willingly
left
anything
human
to
expire
of
hunger
in
that
dungeon
yet
marchdale
judging
of
others
by
himself
felt
by
no
means
sure
of
any
such
thing
and
in
his
horror
of
apprehension
fancied
that
that
was
just
the
sort
of
easy
and
pleasant
and
complete
revenge
that
it
was
in
charles
holland's
power
to
take
and
just
the
one
which
would
suggest
itself
under
the
circumstances
to
his
mind
could
anything
be
possibly
more
full
of
horror
than
such
a
thought
death
let
it
come
in
any
shape
it
may
is
yet
a
most
repulsive
and
unwelcome
guest
but
when
it
comes
so
united
with
all
that
can
add
to
its
terrors
it
is
enough
to
drive
reason
from
its
throne
and
fill
the
mind
with
images
of
absolute
horror
tired
of
shrieking
for
his
parched
lips
and
clogged
tongue
would
scarcely
now
permit
him
to
utter
a
sound
higher
than
a
whisper
marchdale
lay
listening
to
the
furious
storm
without
in
the
last
abandonment
of
despair
oh
what
a
death
is
this
he
groaned
here
alone--all
alone--and
starvation
to
creep
on
me
by
degrees
sapping
life's
energies
one
by
one
already
do
i
feel
the
dreadful
sickening
weakness
growing
on
me
help
oh
help
me
heav--no
no
dare
i
call
on
heaven
to
help
me
is
there
no
fiend
of
darkness
who
now
will
bid
me
a
price
for
a
human
soul
is
there
not
one
who
will
do
so--not
one
who
will
rescue
me
from
the
horror
that
surrounds
me
for
heaven
will
not
i
dare
not
ask
mercy
there
the
storm
continued
louder
and
louder
the
wind
it
is
true
was
nearly
hushed
but
the
roar
and
the
rattle
of
the
echo-awakening
thunder
fully
made
up
for
its
cessation
while
now
and
then
even
there
in
that
underground
abode
some
sudden
reflection
of
the
vivid
lightning's
light
would
find
its
way
lending
for
a
fleeting
moment
sufficient
light
to
marchdale
wherewith
he
could
see
the
gloomy
place
in
which
he
was
at
times
he
wept
and
at
times
he
raved
while
ever
and
anon
he
made
such
frantic
efforts
to
free
himself
from
the
chains
that
were
around
him
that
had
they
not
been
strong
he
must
have
succeeded
but
as
it
was
he
only
made
deep
indentations
into
his
flesh
and
gave
himself
much
pain
charles
holland
he
shouted
oh
release
me
varney
varney
why
do
you
not
come
to
save
me
i
have
toiled
for
you
most
unrequitedly--i
have
not
had
my
reward
let
it
all
consist
in
my
release
from
this
dreadful
bondage
help
help
oh
help
there
was
no
one
to
hear
him
the
storm
continued
and
now
suddenly
a
sudden
and
a
sharper
sound
than
any
awakened
by
the
thunder's
roar
came
upon
his
startled
ear
and
in
increased
agony
he
shouted--
what
is
that
oh
what
is
that
god
of
heaven
do
my
fears
translate
that
sound
aright
can
it
be
oh
can
it
be
that
the
ruins
which
have
stood
for
so
many
a
year
are
now
crumbling
down
before
the
storm
of
to-night
the
sound
came
again
and
he
felt
the
walls
of
the
dungeon
in
which
he
was
shake
now
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
that
the
lightning
had
struck
some
part
of
the
building
and
so
endangered
the
safety
of
all
that
was
above
ground
for
a
moment
there
came
across
his
brain
such
a
rush
of
agony
that
he
neither
spoke
nor
moved
had
that
dreadful
feeling
continued
much
longer
he
must
have
lapsed
into
insanity
but
that
amount
of
mercy--for
mercy
it
would
have
been--was
not
shown
to
him
he
still
felt
all
the
accumulating
horrors
of
his
situation
and
then
with
such
shrieks
as
nothing
but
a
full
appreciation
of
such
horrors
could
have
given
him
strength
to
utter
he
called
upon
earth
upon
heaven
and
upon
all
that
was
infernal
to
save
him
from
his
impending
doom
all
was
in
vain
it
was
an
impending
doom
which
nothing
but
the
direct
interposition
of
heaven
could
have
at
all
averted
and
it
was
not
likely
that
any
such
perversion
of
the
regular
laws
of
nature
would
take
place
to
save
such
a
man
as
marchdale
again
came
the
crashing
sound
of
falling
stones
and
he
was
certain
that
the
old
ruins
which
had
stood
for
so
many
hundred
years
the
storm
and
the
utmost
wrath
of
the
elements
was
at
length
yielding
and
crumbling
down
what
else
could
he
expect
but
to
be
engulphed
among
the
fragments--fragments
still
weighty
and
destructive
although
in
decay
how
fearfully
now
did
his
horrified
imagination
take
in
at
one
glance
as
it
were
a
panoramic
view
of
all
his
past
life
and
how
absolutely
contemptible
at
that
moment
appeared
all
that
he
had
been
striving
for
but
the
walls
shake
again
and
this
time
the
vibration
is
more
fearful
than
before
there
is
a
tremendous
uproar
above
him--the
roof
yields
to
some
superincumbent
pressure--there
is
one
shriek
and
marchdale
lies
crushed
beneath
a
mass
of
masonry
that
it
would
take
men
and
machinery
days
to
remove
from
off
him
all
is
over
now
that
bold
bad
man--that
accomplished
hypocrite--that
mendacious
would-be
murderer
was
no
more
he
lies
but
a
mangled
crushed
and
festering
corpse
may
his
soul
find
mercy
with
his
god
the
storm
from
this
moment
seemed
to
relax
in
its
violence
as
if
it
had
accomplished
a
great
purpose
and
consequently
now
need
no
longer
vex
the
air
with
its
boisterous
presence
gradually
the
thunder
died
away
in
the
distance
the
wind
no
longer
blew
in
blustrous
gusts
but
with
a
gentle
murmuring
swept
around
the
ancient
pile
as
if
singing
the
requiem
of
the
dead
that
lay
beneath--that
dead
which
mortal
eyes
were
never
to
look
upon
the
meeting
of
charles
and
flora
illustration
charles
holland
followed
jack
pringle
for
some
time
in
silence
from
bannerworth
hall
his
mind
was
too
full
of
thought
concerning
the
past
to
allow
him
to
indulge
in
much
of
that
kind
of
conversation
in
which
jack
pringle
might
be
fully
considered
to
be
a
proficient
as
for
jack
somehow
or
another
he
had
felt
his
dignity
offended
in
the
garden
of
bannerworth
hall
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
as
he
afterwards
stated
in
his
own
phraseology
not
to
speak
to
nobody
till
somebody
spoke
to
him
a
growing
anxiety
however
to
ascertain
from
one
who
had
seen
her
lately
how
flora
had
borne
his
absence
at
length
induced
charles
holland
to
break
his
self-imposed
silence
jack
he
said
you
have
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
her
lately
tell
me
does
flora
bannerworth
look
as
she
was
wont
to
look
or
have
all
the
roses
faded
from
her
cheeks
why
as
for
the
roses
said
jack
i'm
blowed
if
i
can
tell
and
seeing
as
how
she
don't
look
at
me
much
i
doesn't
know
nothing
about
her
i
can
tell
you
something
though
about
the
old
admiral
that
will
make
you
open
your
eyes
indeed
jack
and
what
may
that
be
why
he's
took
to
drink
and
gets
groggy
about
every
day
of
his
life
and
the
most
singular
thing
is
that
when
that's
the
case
with
the
old
man
he
says
it's
me
indeed
jack
taken
to
drinking
has
my
poor
old
uncle
from
grief
i
suppose
jack
at
my
disappearance
no
i
don't
think
it's
grief
said
jack
it
strikes
me
it's
rum-and-water
alas
alas
i
never
could
have
imagined
he
could
have
fallen
into
that
habit
of
yours
he
always
seemed
so
far
from
anything
of
this
kind
ay
ay
sir
said
jack
i
know'd
you'd
be
astonished
it
will
be
the
death
of
him
that's
my
opinion
and
the
idea
you
know
master
charles
of
accusing
me
when
he
gets
drunk
himself
i
believe
that
is
a
common
delusion
of
intemperate
persons
said
charles
is
it
sir
well
it's
a
very
awkward
i
thing
because
you
know
sir
as
well
as
most
people
that
i'm
not
the
fellow
to
take
a
drop
too
much
i
cannot
say
jack
that
i
know
so
much
for
i
have
certainly
heard
my
uncle
accuse
you
of
intoxication
lor'
sir
that
was
all
just
on
account
of
his
trying
it
hisself
he
was
a
thinking
on
it
then
and
wanted
to
see
how
i'd
take
it
but
tell
me
of
flora
are
you
quite
certain
that
she
has
had
no
more
alarms
from
varney
what
that
ere
vampyre
fellow
not
a
bit
of
it
your
honour
lor'
bless
you
he
must
have
found
out
by
some
means
or
another
that
i
was
on
the
look
out
and
that
did
the
business
he'll
never
come
near
miss
flora
again
i'll
be
bound
though
to
be
sure
we
moved
away
from
the
hall
on
account
of
him
but
not
that
i
saw
the
good
of
cruising
out
of
one's
own
latitude
but
somehow
or
another
you
see
the
doctor
and
the
admiral
got
it
into
their
heads
to
establish
a
sort
of
blockade
and
the
idea
of
the
thing
was
to
sail
away
in
the
night
quite
quiet
and
after
that
take
up
a
position
that
would
come
across
the
enemy
on
the
larboard
tack
if
so
be
as
he
made
his
appearance
oh
you
allude
to
watching
the
hall
i
presume
ay
ay
sir
just
so
but
would
you
believe
it
master
charlie
the
admiral
and
the
doctor
got
so
blessed
drunk
that
i
could
do
nothing
with
'em
indeed
yes
they
did
indeed
and
made
all
kinds
of
queer
mistakes
so
that
the
end
of
all
that
was
that
the
vampyre
did
come
but
he
got
away
again
he
did
come
then
sir
francis
varney
came
again
after
the
house
was
presumed
to
be
deserted
he
did
sir
that
is
very
strange
what
on
earth
could
have
been
his
object
this
affair
is
most
inexplicably
mysterious
i
hope
the
distance
jack
is
not
far
that
you're
taking
me
for
i'm
incapable
of
enduring
much
fatigue
not
a
great
way
your
honour
keep
two
points
to
the
westward
and
sail
straight
on
we'll
soon
come
to
port
my
eye
won't
there
be
a
squall
when
you
get
in
i
expect
as
miss
flora
will
drop
down
as
dead
as
a
herring
for
she
doesn't
think
you're
above
the
hatches
a
good
thought
jack
my
sudden
appearance
may
produce
alarm
when
we
reach
the
place
of
abode
of
the
bannerworths
you
shall
precede
me
and
prepare
them
in
some
measure
for
my
reception
very
good
sir
do
you
see
that
there
little
white
cottage
a-head
there
in
the
offing
yes
yes
is
that
the
place
yes
your
honour
that's
the
port
to
which
we
are
bound
well
then
jack
you
hasten
a-head
and
see
miss
flora
and
be
sure
you
prepare
her
gently
and
by
degrees
you
know
jack
for
my
appearance
so
that
she
shall
not
be
alarmed
ay
ay
sir
i
understand
you
wait
here
and
i'll
go
and
do
it
there
would
be
a
squall
if
you
were
to
make
your
appearance
sir
all
at
once
she
looks
upon
you
as
safely
lodged
in
davy's
locker
she
minds
me
all
the
world
of
a
girl
i
knew
at
portsmouth
called
bet
bumplush
she
was
one
of
your
delicate
little
creatures
as
don't
live
long
in
this
here
world
no
blow
me
when
i
came
home
from
a
eighteen
months'
cruise
once
i
seed
her
drinking
rum
out
of
a
quart
pot
so
i
says
'hilloa
what
cheer'
and
only
to
think
now
of
the
wonderful
effect
that
there
had
upon
her
with
that
very
pot
she
gives
the
fellow
as
was
standing
treat
a
knobber
on
the
head
as
lasted
him
three
weeks
she
was
too
good
for
this
here
world
she
was
and
too
rummantic
'go
to
blazes'
she
says
to
him
'here's
jack
pringle
come
home'
very
romantic
indeed
said
charles
yes
i
believe
you
sir
and
that
puts
me
in
mind
of
miss
flora
and
you
an
extremely
flattering
comparison
of
course
i
feel
much
obliged
oh
don't
name
it
sir
the
british
tar
as
can't
oblige
a
feller-cretor
is
unworthy
to
tread
the
quarter-deck
or
to
bear
a
hand
to
the
distress
of
a
woman
very
well
said
charles
now
as
we
are
here
precede
me
if
you
please
and
let
me
beg
of
you
to
be
especially
cautious
in
your
manner
of
announcing
me
ay
ay
sir
said
jack
and
away
he
walked
towards
the
cottage
leaving
charles
some
distance
behind
flora
and
the
admiral
were
sitting
together
conversing
the
old
man
who
loved
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
of
his
own
was
endeavouring
to
the
extent
of
his
ability
to
assuage
the
anguish
of
her
thoughts
which
at
that
moment
chanced
to
be
bent
upon
charles
holland
nevermind
my
dear
he
said
he'll
turn
up
some
of
these
days
and
when
he
does
i
sha'n't
forget
to
tell
him
that
it
was
you
who
stood
out
for
his
honesty
and
truth
when
every
one
else
was
against
him
including
myself
an
old
wretch
that
i
was
oh
sir
how
could
you
for
one
moment
believe
that
those
letters
could
have
been
written
by
your
nephew
charles
they
carried
sir
upon
the
face
of
them
their
own
refutation
and
i'm
only
surprised
that
for
one
instant
you
or
any
one
who
knew
him
could
have
believed
him
capable
of
writing
them
avast
there
said
the
admiral
that'll
do
i
own
you
got
the
better
of
the
old
sailor
there
i
think
you
and
jack
pringle
were
the
only
two
persons
who
stood
out
from
the
first
then
i
honour
jack
for
doing
so
and
here
he
is
said
the
admiral
and
you'd
better
tell
him
the
mutinous
rascal
he
wants
all
the
honour
he
can
get
as
a
set-off
against
his
drunkenness
and
other
bad
habits
jack
walked
into
the
room
looked
about
him
in
silence
for
a
moment
thrust
his
hands
in
his
breeches
pockets
and
gave
a
long
whistle
what's
the
matter
now
said
the
admiral
d--me
if
charles
holland
ain't
outside
and
i've
come
to
prepare
you
for
the
blessed
shock
said
jack
don't
faint
either
of
you
because
i'm
only
going
to
let
you
know
it
by
degrees
you
know
a
shriek
burst
from
flora's
lips
and
she
sprung
to
the
door
of
the
apartment
what
cried
the
admiral
my
nephew--my
nephew
charles
jack
you
rascal
if
you're
joking
it's
the
last
joke
you
shall
make
in
this
world
and
if
it's
true
i--i--i'm
an
old
fool
that's
all
ay
ay
sir
said
jack
didn't
you
know
that
afore
charles--charles
cried
flora
he
heard
the
voice
her
name
escaped
his
lips
and
rang
with
a
pleasant
echo
through
the
house
in
another
moment
he
was
in
the
room
and
had
clasped
her
to
his
breast
my
own--my
beautiful--my
true
charles
dear
charles
oh
flora
what
have
i
not
endured
since
last
we
met
but
this
repays
me--more
than
repays
me
for
all
what
is
the
past
now
cried
flora--what
are
all
its
miseries
placed
against
this
happy
happy
moment
d--me
nobody
thinks
of
me
said
the
admiral
my
dear
uncle
said
charles
looking
over
flora's
shoulder
as
he
still
held
her
in
his
arms
is
that
you
yes
yes
swab
it
is
me
and
you
know
it
but
give
us
your
five
you
mutinous
vagabond
and
i
tell
you
what
i'll
do
you
the
greatest
favour
i've
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
you
some
time--i'll
leave
you
alone
you
dog
come
along
jack
ay
ay
sir
said
jack
and
away
they
went
out
of
the
apartment
and
now
those
two
loving
hearts
were
alone--they
who
had
been
so
long
separated
by
malignant
destiny
once
again
were
heart
to
heart
looking
into
each
other's
faces
with
all
the
beaming
tenderness
of
an
affection
of
the
truest
holiest
character
the
admiral
had
done
a
favour
to
them
both
to
leave
them
alone
although
we
much
doubt
whether
his
presence
or
the
presence
of
the
whole
world
would
have
had
the
effect
of
controlling
one
generous
sentiment
of
noble
feeling
they
would
have
forgotten
everything
but
that
they
were
together
and
that
once
again
each
looked
into
the
other's
eyes
with
all
the
tenderness
of
a
love
purer
and
higher
than
ordinarily
belongs
to
mortal
affections
language
was
weak
to
give
utterance
to
the
full
gust
of
happy
feelings
that
now
were
theirs
it
was
ecstasy
enough
to
feel
to
know
that
the
evil
fortune
which
had
so
long
separated
them
depriving
each
existence
of
its
sunniest
aspect
was
over
it
was
enough
for
charles
holland
to
feel
that
she
loved
him
still
it
was
enough
for
flora
bannerworth
to
know
as
she
looked
into
his
beaming
countenance
that
that
love
was
not
misplaced
but
was
met
by
feelings
such
as
she
herself
would
have
dictated
to
be
the
inhabitants
of
the
heart
of
him
whom
she
would
have
chosen
from
the
mass
of
mankind
as
her
own
flora--dear
flora
said
charles
and
you
have
never
doubted
me
i've
never
doubted
charles
heaven
or
you
to
doubt
one
would
have
been
to
doubt
both
generous
and
best
of
girls
what
must
you
have
thought
of
my
enforced
absence
oh
flora
i
was
unjust
enough
to
your
truth
to
make
my
greatest
pang
the
thought
that
you
might
doubt
me
and
cast
me
from
your
heart
for
ever
ah
charles
you
ought
to
have
known
me
better
i
stood
amid
sore
temptation
to
do
so
much
there
were
those
who
would
have
urged
me
on
to
think
that
you
had
cast
me
from
your
heart
for
ever
there
were
those
ready
and
willing
to
place
the
worst
construction
upon
your
conduct
and
with
a
devilish
ingenuity
to
strive
to
make
me
participate
in
such
a
feeling
but
no
charles
no--i
loved
you
and
i
trusted
you
and
i
could
not
so
far
belie
my
own
judgment
as
to
tell
you
other
than
what
you
always
seemed
to
my
young
fancy
and
you
are
right
my
flora
right
and
is
it
not
a
glorious
triumph
to
see
that
love--that
sentiment
of
passion--has
enabled
you
to
have
so
enduring
and
so
noble
a
confidence
in
aught
human
ay
charles
it
is
the
sentiment
of
passion
for
our
love
has
been
more
a
sentiment
than
a
passion
i
would
fain
think
that
we
had
loved
each
other
with
an
affection
not
usually
known
appreciated
or
understood
and
so
in
the
vanity
of
my
best
affections
i
would
strive
to
think
them
something
exclusive
and
beyond
the
common
feelings
of
humanity
and
you
are
right
my
flora
such
love
as
yours
is
the
exception
there
may
be
preferences
there
may
be
passions
and
there
may
be
sentiments
but
never
never
surely
was
there
a
heart
like
yours
nay
charles
now
you
speak
from
a
too
poetical
fancy
but
is
it
possible
that
i
have
had
you
here
so
long
with
your
hand
clasped
in
mine
and
asked
you
not
the
causes
of
your
absence
oh
flora
i
have
suffered
much--much
physically
but
more
mentally
it
was
the
thought
of
you
that
was
at
once
the
bane
and
the
antidote
of
my
existence
indeed
charles
did
i
present
myself
in
such
contradictory
colours
to
you
yes
dearest
as
thus
when
i
thought
of
you
sometimes
in
the
deep
seclusion
of
a
dungeon
that
thought
almost
goaded
me
to
madness
because
it
brought
with
it
the
conviction--a
conviction
peculiar
to
a
lover--that
none
could
so
effectually
stand
between
you
and
all
evil
as
myself
yes
yes
charles
most
true
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
all
the
world
in
arms
could
not
have
protected
you
so
well
as
this
one
heart
clad
in
the
triple
steel
of
its
affections
could
have
shielded
you
from
evil
ay
charles
and
then
i
was
the
bane
of
your
existence
because
i
filled
you
with
apprehension
for
a
time
dearest
and
then
came
the
antidote
for
when
exhausted
alike
in
mind
and
body--when
lying
helpless
with
chains
upon
my
limbs--when
expecting
death
at
every
visit
of
those
who
had
dragged
me
from
light
and
from
liberty
and
from
love
it
was
but
the
thought
of
thy
beauty
and
thy
affection
that
nerved
me
and
gave
me
a
hope
even
amidst
the
cruellest
disaster
and
then--and
then
charles
you
were
my
blessing
as
you
have
ever
been--as
you
are
and
as
you
will
ever
be--my
own
flora
my
beautiful--my
true
we
won't
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
is
the
fact
but
from
a
series
of
singular
sounds
which
reached
even
to
the
passage
of
the
cottage
we
have
our
own
private
opinion
to
the
effect
that
charles
began
kissing
flora
at
the
top
of
her
forehead
and
never
stopped
somehow
or
another
till
he
got
down
to
her
chin--no
not
her
chin--her
sweet
lips--he
could
not
get
past
them
perhaps
it
was
wrong
but
we
can't
help
it--we
are
faithful
chroniclers
reader
if
you
be
of
the
sterner
sex
what
would
you
have
done--if
of
the
gentler
what
would
you
have
permitted
mutual
explanations
and
the
visit
to
the
ruins
illustration
during
the
next
hour
charles
informed
flora
of
the
whole
particulars
of
his
forcible
abduction
and
to
his
surprise
he
heard
of
course
for
the
first
time
of
those
letters
purporting
to
be
written
by
him
which
endeavoured
to
give
so
bad
an
aspect
to
the
fact
of
his
sudden
disappearance
from
bannerworth
hall
flora
would
insist
upon
the
admiral
henry
and
the
rest
of
the
family
hearing
all
that
charles
had
to
relate
concerning
mr
marchdale
for
well
she
knew
that
her
mother
from
early
associations
was
so
far
impressed
in
the
favour
of
that
hypocritical
personage
that
nothing
but
damning
facts
much
to
his
prejudice
would
suffice
to
convince
her
of
the
character
he
really
was
but
she
was
open
to
conviction
and
when
she
really
found
what
a
villain
she
had
cherished
and
given
her
confidence
to
she
shed
abundance
of
tears
and
blamed
herself
exceedingly
as
the
cause
of
some
of
the
misfortunes
which
had
fallen
upon
her
children
very
good
said
the
admiral
i
ain't
surprised
a
bit
i
knew
he
was
a
vagabond
from
the
first
time
i
clapped
eyes
upon
him
there
was
a
down
look
about
the
fellow's
figure-head
that
i
didn't
like
and
be
hanged
to
him
but
i
never
thought
he
would
have
gone
the
length
he
has
done
and
so
you
say
you've
got
him
safe
in
the
ruins
charles
i
have
indeed
uncle
and
then
there
let
him
remain
and
a
good
place
too
for
him
no
uncle
no
i'm
sure
you
speak
without
thought
i
intend
to
release
him
in
a
few
hours
when
i
have
rested
from
my
fatigues
he
could
not
come
to
any
harm
if
he
were
to
go
without
food
entirely
for
the
time
that
i
leave
him
but
even
that
he
will
not
do
for
there
is
bread
and
water
in
the
dungeon
bread
and
water
that's
too
good
for
him
but
however
charles
when
you
go
to
let
him
out
i'll
go
with
you
just
to
tell
him
what
i
think
of
him
the
vagabond
he
must
suffer
amazingly
for
no
doubt
knowing
well
as
he
does
his
own
infamous
intentions
he
will
consider
that
if
i
were
to
leave
him
to
starve
to
death
i
should
be
but
retailing
upon
him
the
injuries
he
would
have
inflicted
upon
me
the
worst
of
it
is
said
the
admiral
i
can't
think
what
to
do
with
him
do
nothing
uncle
but
just
let
him
go
it
will
be
a
sufficient
punishment
for
such
a
man
to
feel
that
instead
of
succeeding
in
his
designs
he
has
only
brought
upon
himself
the
bitterest
contempt
of
those
whom
he
would
fain
have
injured
i
can
have
no
desire
for
revenge
on
such
a
man
as
marchdale
you
are
right
charles
said
flora
let
him
go
and
let
him
go
with
a
feeling
that
he
has
acquired
the
contempt
of
those
whose
best
opinions
might
have
been
his
for
a
far
less
amount
of
trouble
than
he
has
taken
to
acquire
their
worst
excitement
had
kept
up
charles
to
this
point
but
now
when
he
arose
and
expressed
his
intention
of
going
to
the
ruins
for
the
purpose
of
releasing
marchdale
he
exhibited
such
unequivocal
symptoms
of
exhaustion
and
fatigue
that
neither
his
uncle
nor
flora
would
permit
him
to
go
so
in
deference
to
them
he
gave
up
the
point
and
commissioned
the
admiral
and
jack
with
henry
to
proceed
to
the
place
and
give
the
villain
his
freedom
little
suspecting
what
had
occurred
since
he
had
himself
left
the
neighbourhood
of
those
ruins
of
course
charles
holland
couldn't
be
at
all
accountable
for
the
work
of
the
elements
and
it
was
not
for
him
to
imagine
that
when
he
left
marchdale
in
the
dungeon
that
so
awful
a
catastrophe
as
that
we
have
recorded
to
the
reader
was
to
ensue
the
distance
to
the
ruins
was
not
so
great
from
this
cottage
even
as
it
was
from
bannerworth
hall
provided
those
who
went
knew
the
most
direct
and
best
road
to
take
so
that
the
admiral
was
not
gone
above
a
couple
of
hours
and
when
he
returned
he
sat
down
and
looked
at
charles
with
such
a
peculiar
expression
that
the
latter
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
tell
what
to
make
of
it
illustration
something
has
happened
uncle
he
said
i
am
certain
tell
me
at
once
what
it
is
oh
nothing
nothing
said
the
admiral
of
any
importance
is
that
what
you
call
your
feelings
said
jack
pringle
can't
you
tell
him
as
there
came
on
a
squall
last
night
and
the
ruins
have
come
in
with
a
dab
upon
old
marchdale
crushing
his
guts
so
that
we
smelt
him
as
soon
as
we
got
nigh
at
hand
good
god
said
charles
has
such
a
catastrophe
occurred
yes
charles
that's
just
about
the
catastrophe
that
has
occurred
he's
dead
and
rum
enough
it
is
that
it
should
happen
on
the
very
night
that
you
escaped
rum
said
jack
suddenly
my
eye
who
mentions
rum
what
a
singular
sort
of
liquor
rum
must
be
i
heard
of
a
chap
as
used
to
be
fond
of
it
once
on
board
a
ship
i
wonder
if
there's
any
in
the
house
no
said
the
admiral
but
there's
a
fine
pump
of
spring
water
outside
if
you
feel
a
little
thirsty
jack
and
i'll
engage
it
shall
do
you
more
good
than
all
the
rum
in
the
world
uncle
said
charles
i'm
glad
to
hear
you
make
that
observation
what
for
why
to
deal
candidly
with
you
uncle
jack
informed
me
that
you
had
lately
taken
quite
a
predilection
for
drinking
me
cried
the
admiral
why
the
infernal
rascal
i've
had
to
threaten
him
with
his
discharge
a
dozen
times
at
least
on
that
very
ground
and
no
other
there's
somebody
calling
me
said
jack
i'm
a
coming
i'm
a
coming
and
so
he
bolted
out
of
the
room
just
in
time
to
escape
an
inkstand
which
the
admiral
caught
up
and
flung
after
him
i'll
strike
that
rascal
off
the
ship's
books
this
very
day
muttered
admiral
bell
the
drunken
vagabond
to
pretend
that
i
take
anything
when
all
the
while
it's
himself
well
well
i
ought
certainly
to
have
suspected
the
quarter
from
whence
the
intelligence
came
but
he
told
it
to
me
so
circumstantially
and
with
such
an
apparent
feeling
of
regret
for
the
weakness
into
which
he
said
you
had
fallen
that
i
really
thought
there
might
be
some
truth
in
it
the
rascal
i've
done
with
him
from
this
moment
i
have
put
up
with
too
much
from
him
for
years
past
i
think
now
that
you
have
given
him
a
great
deal
of
liberty
and
that
with
a
great
deal
more
he
has
taken
makes
up
an
amount
which
you
find
it
difficult
to
endure
and
i
won't
endure
it
let
me
talk
to
him
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
able
to
convince
him
that
he
goes
too
far
and
when
he
finds
that
such
is
the
case
he
will
mend
speak
to
him
if
you
like
but
i
have
done
with
such
a
mutinous
rascal
i
have
you
can
take
him
into
your
service
if
you
like
till
you
get
tired
of
him
and
that
won't
be
very
long
well
well
we
shall
see
jack
will
apologise
to
you
i
have
no
doubt
and
then
i
shall
intercede
for
him
and
advise
you
to
give
him
another
trial
if
you
get
him
into
the
apology
then
there's
no
doubt
about
me
giving
him
another
trial
but
i
know
him
too
well
for
that
he's
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
he
is
and
you
won't
get
a
civil
word
out
of
him
but
never
mind
that
now
i
tell
you
what
master
charley
it
will
take
a
good
lot
of
roast
beef
to
get
up
your
good
looks
again
it
will
indeed
uncle
and
i
require
now
rest
for
i
am
thoroughly
exhausted
the
great
privations
i
have
undergone
and
the
amount
of
mental
excitement
which
i
have
experienced
in
consequence
of
the
sudden
and
unexpected
release
from
a
fearful
confinement
have
greatly
weakened
all
my
energies
a
few
hours'
sleep
will
make
quite
a
different
being
of
me
well
my
boy
you
know
best
returned
the
admiral
and
i'll
take
care
if
you
sleep
till
to-morrow
that
you
sha'n't
be
disturbed
so
now
be
off
to
bed
at
once
the
young
man
shook
his
uncle's
hand
in
a
cordial
manner
and
then
repaired
to
the
apartment
which
had
been
provided
for
him
charles
holland
did
indeed
stand
in
need
of
repose
and
for
the
first
time
now
for
many
days
he
laid
down
with
serenity
at
his
heart
and
slept
for
many
hours
and
was
there
not
now
a
great
and
a
happy
change
in
flora
bannerworth
as
if
by
magic
in
a
few
short
hours
much
of
the
bloom
of
her
before-fading
beauty
returned
to
her
her
step
again
recovered
its
springy
lightness
again
she
smiled
upon
her
mother
and
suffered
herself
to
talk
of
a
happy
future
for
the
dread
even
of
the
vampyre's
visitations
had
faded
into
comparative
insignificance
against
the
heart's
deep
dejection
which
had
come
over
her
at
the
thought
that
charles
holland
must
surely
be
murdered
or
he
would
have
contrived
to
come
to
her
and
what
a
glorious
recompense
she
had
now
for
the
trusting
confidence
with
which
she
had
clung
to
a
conviction
of
his
truth
was
it
not
great
now
to
feel
that
when
he
was
condemned
by
others
and
when
strong
and
unimpeachable
evidence
seemed
to
be
against
him
she
had
clung
to
him
and
declared
her
faith
in
his
honour
and
wept
for
him
instead
of
condemning
yes
flora
you
were
of
that
order
of
noble
minds
that
where
once
confidence
is
given
give
it
fully
and
completely
and
will
not
harbour
a
suspicion
of
the
faith
of
the
loved
one
a
happy
disposition
when
verified
as
in
this
instance
by
an
answering
truthfulness
but
when
such
a
heart
trusts
not
with
judgment--when
that
pure
exalted
and
noble
confidence
is
given
to
an
object
unworthy
of
it--then
comes
indeed
the
most
fearful
of
all
mental
struggles
and
if
the
fond
heart
that
has
hugged
to
its
inmost
core
so
worthless
a
treasure
do
not
break
in
the
effort
to
discard
it
we
may
well
be
surprised
at
the
amount
of
fortitude
that
has
endured
so
much
although
the
admiral
had
said
but
little
concerning
the
fearful
end
marchdale
had
come
to
it
really
did
make
some
impression
upon
him
and
much
as
he
held
in
abhorrence
the
villany
of
marchdale's
conduct
he
would
gladly
in
his
heart
have
averted
the
fate
from
him
that
he
had
brought
upon
himself
on
the
road
to
the
ruins
he
calculated
upon
taking
a
different
kind
of
vengeance
when
they
had
got
some
distance
from
the
cottage
admiral
bell
made
a
proposal
to
henry
to
be
his
second
while
he
fought
marchdale
but
henry
would
not
hear
of
it
for
a
moment
my
dear
sir
he
said
could
i
do
you
think
stand
by
and
see
a
valuable
revered
and
a
respected
life
like
yours
exposed
to
any
hazard
merely
upon
the
chance
of
punishing
a
villain
no
no
marchdale
is
too
base
now
to
be
met
in
honourable
encounter
if
he
is
dealt
with
in
any
way
let
it
be
by
the
laws
this
was
reasonable
enough
and
after
some
argument
the
admiral
coincided
in
it
and
then
they
began
to
wonder
how
without
charles
they
should
be
able
to
get
an
entrance
to
the
dungeons
for
it
had
been
his
intention
originally
had
he
not
felt
so
fatigued
to
go
with
them
as
soon
however
as
they
got
tolerably
near
to
the
ruins
they
saw
what
had
happened
neither
spoke
but
they
quickened
their
pace
and
soon
stood
close
to
the
mass
of
stone-work
which
now
had
assumed
so
different
a
shape
to
what
it
had
a
few
short
hours
before
it
needed
little
examination
to
let
them
feel
certain
that
whoever
might
have
been
in
any
of
the
underground
dungeons
must
have
been
crushed
to
death
heaven
have
mercy
upon
his
soul
said
henry
amen
said
the
admiral
they
both
turned
away
and
for
some
time
they
neither
of
them
spoke
for
their
thoughts
were
full
of
reflection
upon
the
horrible
death
which
marchdale
must
have
endured
at
length
the
admiral
said--
shall
we
tell
this
or
not
tell
it
at
once
said
henry
let
us
have
no
secrets
good
then
i
will
not
make
one
you
may
depend
i
only
wish
that
while
he
was
about
it
charley
could
have
popped
that
rascal
varney
as
well
in
the
dungeon
and
then
there
would
have
been
an
end
and
a
good
riddance
of
them
both
the
second
night-watch
of
mr
chillingworth
at
the
hall
illustration
the
military
party
in
the
morning
left
bannerworth
hall
and
the
old
place
resumed
its
wonted
quiet
but
dr
chillingworth
found
it
difficult
to
get
rid
of
his
old
friend
the
hangman
who
seemed
quite
disposed
to
share
his
watch
with
him
the
doctor
without
being
at
all
accused
of
being
a
prejudiced
man
might
well
object
to
the
continued
companionship
of
one
who
according
to
his
own
account
was
decidedly
no
better
than
he
should
be
if
he
were
half
so
good
moreover
it
materially
interfered
with
the
proceedings
of
our
medical
friend
whose
object
was
to
watch
the
vampyre
with
all
imaginable
quietness
and
secrecy
in
the
event
of
his
again
visiting
bannerworth
hall
sir
he
said
to
the
hangman
now
that
you
have
so
obligingly
related
to
me
your
melancholy
history
i
will
not
detain
you
oh
you
are
not
detaining
me
yes
but
i
shall
probably
remain
here
for
a
considerable
time
i
have
nothing
to
do
and
one
place
is
about
the
same
as
another
to
me
well
then
if
i
must
speak
plainly
allow
me
to
say
that
as
i
came
here
upon
a
very
important
and
special
errand
i
desire
most
particularly
to
be
left
alone
do
you
understand
me
now
oh
ah--i
understand
you
want
me
to
go
just
so
well
then
dr
chillingworth
allow
me
to
tell
you
i
have
come
here
on
a
very
special
errand
likewise
you
have
i
have
i
have
been
putting
one
circumstance
to
another
and
drawing
a
variety
of
conclusions
from
a
variety
of
facts
so
that
i
have
come
to
what
i
consider
an
important
resolve
namely
to
have
a
good
look
at
bannerworth
hall
and
if
i
continue
to
like
it
as
well
as
i
do
now
i
should
like
to
make
the
bannerworth
family
an
offer
for
the
purchase
of
it
the
devil
you
would
why
all
the
world
seems
mad
upon
the
project
of
buying
this
old
building
which
really
is
getting
into
such
a
state
of
dilapidation
that
it
cannot
last
many
years
longer
it
is
my
fancy
no
no
there
is
something
more
in
this
than
meets
the
eye
the
same
reason
be
it
what
may
that
has
induced
varney
the
vampyre
to
become
so
desirous
of
possessing
the
hall
actuates
you
possibly
and
what
is
that
reason
you
may
as
well
be
candid
with
me
yes
i
will
and
am
i
like
the
picturesque
aspect
of
the
place
no
you
know
that
that
is
a
disingenuous
answer
that
you
know
well
it
is
not
the
aspect
of
the
old
hall
that
has
charms
for
you
but
i
feel
only
from
your
conduct
more
than
ever
convinced
that
some
plot
is
going
on
having
the
accomplishment
of
some
great
object
as
its
climax
a
something
of
which
you
have
guessed
how
much
you
are
mistaken
no
i
am
certain
i
am
right
and
i
shall
immediately
advise
the
bannerworth
family
to
return
and
to
take
up
their
abode
again
here
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
the
hopes
which
you
or
varney
or
any
one
else
may
have
of
getting
possession
of
the
place
if
you
were
a
man
said
the
hangman
who
cared
a
little
more
for
yourself
and
a
little
less
for
others
i
would
make
a
confidant
of
you
what
do
you
mean
why
i
mean
candidly
that
you
are
not
selfish
enough
to
be
entitled
to
my
confidence
that
is
a
strange
reason
for
withholding
confidence
from
any
man
it
is
a
strange
reason
but
in
this
case
a
most
abundantly
true
one
i
cannot
tell
you
what
i
would
tell
you
because
i
cannot
make
the
agreement
with
you
that
i
would
fain
make
you
talk
in
riddles
to
explain
which
then
would
be
to
tell
my
secret
dr
chillingworth
was
evidently
much
annoyed
and
yet
he
was
in
an
extremely
helpless
condition
for
as
to
forcing
the
hangman
to
leave
the
hall
if
he
did
not
feel
disposed
to
do
so
that
was
completely
out
of
the
question
and
could
not
be
done
in
the
first
place
he
was
a
much
more
powerful
man
than
the
doctor
and
in
the
second
it
was
quite
contrary
to
all
mr
chillingworth's
habits
to
engage
in
anything
like
personal
warfare
he
could
only
therefore
look
his
vexation
and
say--
if
you
are
determined
upon
remaining
i
cannot
help
it
but
when
some
one
as
there
assuredly
will
comes
from
the
bannerworths
here
to
me
or
i
shall
be
under
the
necessity
of
stating
candidly
that
you
are
intruding
very
good
as
the
morning
air
is
keen
and
as
we
now
are
not
likely
to
be
as
good
company
to
each
other
as
we
were
i
shall
go
inside
the
house
this
was
a
proposition
which
the
doctor
did
not
like
but
he
was
compelled
to
submit
to
it
and
he
saw
with
feelings
of
uneasiness
the
hangman
make
his
way
into
the
hall
by
one
of
the
windows
then
dr
chillingworth
sat
down
to
think
much
he
wondered
what
could
be
the
secret
of
the
great
desire
which
varney
marchdale
and
even
this
man
had
all
of
them
to
be
possessors
of
the
old
hall
that
there
was
some
powerful
incentive
he
felt
convinced
and
he
longed
for
some
conversation
with
the
bannerworths
or
with
admiral
bell
in
order
that
he
might
state
what
had
now
taken
place
that
some
one
would
soon
come
to
him
in
order
to
bring
fresh
provisions
for
the
day
he
was
certain
and
all
he
could
do
in
the
interim
was
to
listen
to
what
the
hangman
was
about
in
the
hall
not
a
sound
for
a
considerable
time
disturbed
the
intense
stillness
of
the
place
but
now
suddenly
mr
chillingworth
thought
he
heard
a
hammering
as
if
some
one
was
at
work
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
hall
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
that
he
said
and
he
was
about
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
interior
of
the
building
through
the
same
window
which
had
enabled
the
hangman
to
gain
admittance
when
he
heard
his
own
name
pronounced
by
some
one
at
the
back
of
the
garden
fence
and
upon
casting
his
eyes
in
that
direction
he
to
his
great
relief
saw
the
admiral
and
henry
bannerworth
come
round
to
the
gate
said
the
doctor
i
am
more
glad
to
see
you
than
i
can
tell
you
just
now
do
not
make
more
noise
than
you
can
help
but
come
round
to
the
gate
at
once
they
obeyed
the
injunction
with
alacrity
and
when
the
doctor
had
admitted
them
the
admiral
said
eagerly--
you
don't
mean
to
tell
us
that
he
is
here
no
no
not
varney
but
he
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
taken
a
great
affection
for
bannerworth
hall
you
may
have
another
tenant
for
it
and
i
believe
at
any
price
you
like
to
name
indeed
hush
creep
along
close
to
the
house
and
then
you
will
not
be
seen
there
do
you
hear
that
noise
in
the
hall
why
it
sounds
said
the
admiral
like
the
ship's
carpenter
at
work
it
does
indeed
sound
like
a
carpenter
it's
only
the
new
tenant
making
i
dare
say
some
repairs
d--n
his
impudence
why
it
certainly
does
look
like
a
very
cool
proceeding
i
must
admit
who
and
what
is
he
who
he
is
now
i
cannot
tell
you
but
he
was
once
the
hangman
of
london
at
a
time
when
i
was
practising
in
the
metropolis
and
so
i
became
acquainted
with
him
he
knows
sir
francis
varney
and
if
i
mistake
not
has
found
out
the
cause
of
that
mysterious
personage's
great
attachment
to
bannerworth
hall
and
has
found
the
reasons
so
cogent
that
he
has
got
up
an
affection
for
it
himself
to
me
said
henry
all
this
is
as
incomprehensible
as
anything
can
possibly
be
what
on
earth
does
it
all
mean
my
dear
henry
said
the
doctor
will
you
be
ruled
by
me
i
will
be
ruled
by
any
one
whom
i
know
i
can
trust
for
i
am
like
a
man
groping
his
way
in
the
dark
then
allow
this
gentleman
who
is
carpentering
away
so
pleasantly
within
the
house
to
do
so
to
his
heart's
content
but
don't
let
him
leave
it
show
yourselves
now
in
the
garden
he
has
sufficient
prudence
to
know
that
three
constitute
rather
fearful
odds
against
one
and
so
he
will
be
careful
and
remain
where
he
is
if
he
should
come
out
we
need
not
let
him
go
until
we
thoroughly
ascertain
what
he
has
been
about
you
shall
command
the
squadron
doctor
said
the
admiral
and
have
it
all
your
own
way
you
know
so
here
goes
come
along
henry
and
let's
show
ourselves
we
are
both
armed
too
they
walked
out
into
the
centre
of
the
garden
and
they
were
soon
convinced
that
the
hangman
saw
them
for
a
face
appeared
at
the
window
and
was
as
quickly
withdrawn
again
there
said
the
doctor
now
he
knows
he
is
a
prisoner
and
we
may
as
well
place
ourselves
in
some
position
which
commands
a
good
view
of
the
house
as
well
as
of
the
garden
gate
and
so
see
if
we
cannot
starve
him
out
though
we
may
be
starved
out
ourselves
not
at
all
said
admiral
bell
producing
from
his
ample
pockets
various
parcels--we
came
to
bring
you
ample
supplies
indeed
yes
we
have
been
as
far
as
the
ruins
oh
to
release
marchdale
charles
told
me
how
the
villain
had
fallen
into
the
trap
he
had
laid
for
him
he
has
indeed
fallen
into
the
trap
and
it's
one
he
won't
easily
get
out
of
again
he's
dead
dead--dead
yes
in
the
storm
of
last
night
the
ruins
have
fallen
and
he
is
by
this
time
as
flat
as
a
pancake
good
god
and
yet
it
is
but
a
just
retribution
upon
him
he
would
have
assassinated
poor
charles
holland
in
the
cruelest
and
most
cold-blooded
manner
and
however
we
may
shudder
at
the
manner
of
his
death
we
cannot
regret
it
except
that
he
has
escaped
your
friend
the
hangman
said
the
admiral
don't
call
him
my
friend
if
you
please
said
dr
chillingworth
but
hark
how
he
is
working
away
as
if
he
really
intended
to
carry
the
house
away
piece
by
piece
as
opportunity
may
serve
if
you
will
not
let
it
to
him
altogether
just
as
it
stands
confound
him
he
is
evidently
working
on
his
own
account
said
the
admiral
or
he
would
not
be
half
so
industrious
there
was
indeed
a
tremendous
amount
of
hammering
and
noise
of
one
sort
and
another
from
the
house
and
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
hangman
was
too
heart
and
soul
in
his
work
whatever
may
have
been
the
object
of
it
to
care
who
was
listening
to
him
or
to
what
conjecture
he
gave
rise
he
thought
probably
that
he
could
but
he
stopped
in
what
he
was
about
and
until
he
was
so
that
he
might
as
well
go
on
and
on
he
went
with
a
vengeance
vexing
the
admiral
terribly
who
proposed
so
repeatedly
to
go
into
the
house
and
insist
upon
knowing
what
he
was
about
that
his
wishes
were
upon
the
point
of
being
conceded
to
by
henry
although
they
were
combatted
by
the
doctor
when
from
the
window
at
which
he
had
entered
out
stepped
the
hangman
good
morning
gentlemen
good
morning
he
said
and
he
moved
towards
the
garden
gate
i
will
not
trouble
you
any
longer
good
morning
not
so
fast
said
the
admiral
or
we
may
bring
you
up
with
a
round
turn
and
i
never
miss
my
mark
when
i
can
see
it
and
i
shall
not
let
it
get
out
of
sight
you
may
depend
he
drew
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
as
he
spoke
and
pointed
it
at
the
hangman
who
thereupon
paused
and
said--
what
am
i
not
to
be
permitted
to
go
in
peace
why
it
was
but
a
short
time
since
the
doctor
was
quarrelling
with
me
because
i
did
not
go
and
now
it
seems
that
i
am
to
be
shot
if
i
do
yes
said
the
admiral
that's
it
well
but--
you
dare
said
he
stir
another
inch
towards
the
gate
and
you
are
a
dead
man
the
hangman
hesitated
a
moment
and
looked
at
admiral
bell
apparently
the
result
of
the
scrutiny
was
that
he
would
keep
his
word
for
he
suddenly
turned
and
dived
in
at
the
window
again
without
saying
another
word
well
you
have
certainly
stopped
him
from
leaving
said
henry
but
what's
to
be
done
now
let
him
be
let
him
be
said
the
doctor
he
must
come
out
again
for
there
are
no
provisions
in
the
place
and
he
will
be
starved
out
hush
what
is
that
said
henry
there
was
a
very
gentle
ring
at
the
bell
which
hung
over
the
garden
gate
that's
an
experiment
now
i'll
be
bound
said
the
doctor
to
ascertain
if
any
one
is
here
let
us
hide
ourselves
and
take
no
notice
the
ring
in
a
few
moments
was
repeated
and
the
three
confederates
hid
themselves
effectually
behind
some
thick
laurel
bushes
and
awaited
with
expectation
what
might
next
ensue
not
long
had
they
occupied
their
place
of
concealment
before
they
heard
a
heavy
fall
upon
the
gravelled
pathway
immediately
within
the
gate
as
if
some
one
had
clambered
to
the
top
from
the
outside
and
then
jumped
down
that
this
was
the
case
the
sound
of
footsteps
soon
convinced
them
and
to
their
surprise
as
well
as
satisfaction
they
saw
through
the
interstices
of
the
laurel
bush
behind
which
they
were
concealed
no
less
a
personage
that
sir
francis
varney
himself
it
is
varney
said
henry
yes
yes
whispered
the
doctor
let
him
be
do
not
move
for
any
consideration
for
the
first
time
let
him
do
just
what
he
likes
d--n
the
fellow
said
the
admiral
there
are
some
points
about
him
that
like
after
all
and
he's
quite
an
angel
compared
to
that
rascal
marchdale
he
is--he
saved
charles
he
did
and
not
if
i
know
it
shall
any
harm
come
to
him
unless
he
were
terribly
to
provoke
it
by
becoming
himself
the
assailant
how
sad
he
looks
hush
he
comes
nearer
it
is
not
safe
to
talk
look
at
him
varney
in
the
garden--the
communication
of
dr
chillingworth
to
the
admiral
and
henry
illustration
kind
reader
it
was
indeed
varney
who
had
clambered
over
the
garden
wall
and
thus
made
his
way
into
the
garden
of
bannerworth
hall
and
what
filled
those
who
looked
at
him
with
the
most
surprise
was
that
he
did
not
seem
in
any
particular
way
to
make
a
secret
of
his
presence
but
walked
on
with
an
air
of
boldness
which
either
arose
from
a
feeling
of
absolute
impunity
from
his
thinking
there
was
no
one
there
or
from
an
audacity
which
none
but
he
could
have
compassed
as
for
the
little
party
that
was
there
assembled
and
who
looked
upon
him
they
seemed
thunderstricken
by
his
presence
and
henry
probably
as
well
as
the
admiral
would
have
burst
out
into
some
sudden
exclamation
had
they
not
been
restrained
by
dr
chillingworth
who
suspecting
that
they
might
in
some
way
give
an
alarm
hastened
to
speak
first
saying
in
a
whisper--
for
heaven's
sake
be
still
fortune
you
see
favours
us
most
strangely
leave
varney
alone
you
have
no
other
mode
whatever
of
discovering
what
he
really
wants
at
bannerworth
hall
i
am
glad
you
have
spoken
said
henry
as
he
drew
a
long
breath
if
you
had
not
i
feel
convinced
that
in
another
moment
i
should
have
rushed
forward
and
confronted
this
man
who
has
been
the
very
bane
of
my
life
and
so
should
i
said
the
admiral
although
i
protest
against
any
harm
being
done
to
him
on
account
of
some
sort
of
good
feeling
that
he
has
displayed
after
all
in
releasing
charles
from
that
dungeon
in
which
marchdale
has
perished
at
the
moment
said
henry
i
had
forgotten
that
but
i
will
own
that
his
conduct
has
been
tinctured
by
a
strange
and
wild
kind
of
generosity
at
times
which
would
seem
to
bespeak
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
some
good
feelings
the
impulses
of
which
were
only
quenched
by
circumstances
that
is
my
firm
impression
of
him
i
can
assure
you
said
dr
chillingworth
they
watched
varney
now
from
the
leafy
covert
in
which
they
were
situated
and
indeed
had
they
been
less
effectually
concealed
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
the
much
dreaded
vampyre
would
have
perceived
them
for
not
only
did
he
make
no
effort
at
concealment
himself
but
he
took
no
pains
to
see
if
any
one
was
watching
him
in
his
progress
to
the
house
his
footsteps
were
more
rapid
than
they
usually
were
and
there
was
altogether
an
air
and
manner
about
him
as
if
he
were
moved
to
some
purpose
which
of
itself
was
sufficiently
important
to
submerge
in
its
consequences
all
ordinary
risks
and
all
ordinary
cautions
he
tried
several
windows
of
the
house
along
that
terrace
of
which
we
have
more
than
once
had
occasion
to
speak
before
he
found
one
that
opened
but
at
length
he
did
succeed
and
stepped
at
once
into
the
hall
leaving
those
who
now
for
some
moments
in
silence
had
regarded
his
movements
to
lose
themselves
in
a
fearful
sea
of
conjecture
as
to
what
could
possibly
be
his
object
at
all
events
said
the
admiral
i'm
glad
we
are
here
if
the
vampyre
should
have
a
fight
with
that
other
fellow
that
we
heard
doing
such
a
lot
of
carpentering
work
in
the
house
we
ought
i
think
to
see
fair
play
i
for
one
said
the
doctor
would
not
like
to
stand
by
and
see
the
vampyre
murdered
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
he
is
a
good
match
for
any
mortal
opponent
you
may
depend
he
is
said
henry
but
how
long
doctor
do
you
purpose
that
we
should
wait
here
in
such
a
state
of
suspense
as
to
what
is
going
on
within
the
house
i
hope
not
long
but
that
something
will
occur
to
make
us
have
food
for
action
hark
what
is
that
there
was
a
loud
crash
within
the
building
as
of
broken
glass
it
sounded
as
if
some
window
had
been
completely
dashed
in
but
although
they
looked
carefully
over
the
front
of
the
building
they
could
see
no
evidences
of
such
a
thing
having
happened
and
were
compelled
consequently
to
come
to
the
opinion
that
varney
and
the
other
man
must
have
met
in
one
of
the
back
rooms
and
that
the
crash
of
glass
had
arisen
from
some
personal
conflict
in
which
they
had
engaged
i
cannot
stand
this
said
henry
nay
nay
said
the
doctor
be
still
and
i
will
tell
you
something
than
which
there
can
be
no
more
fitting
time
than
this
to
reveal
it
refers
it
to
the
vampyre
it
does--it
does
be
brief
then
i
am
in
an
agony
of
impatience
it
is
a
circumstance
concerning
which
i
can
be
brief
for
horrible
as
it
is
i
have
no
wish
to
dress
it
in
any
adventitious
colours
sir
francis
varney
although
under
another
name
is
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
acquaintance
said
henry
why
you
don't
mean
to
say
you
are
a
vampyre
said
the
admiral
or
that
he
has
ever
visited
you
no
but
i
knew
him
from
the
first
moment
that
i
looked
upon
him
in
this
neighbourhood
i
thought
i
knew
him
but
the
circumstance
which
induced
me
to
think
so
was
of
so
terrific
a
character
that
i
made
some
efforts
to
chase
it
from
my
mind
it
has
however
grown
upon
me
day
by
day
and
lately
i
have
had
proof
sufficient
to
convince
me
of
his
identity
with
one
whom
i
first
saw
under
most
singular
circumstances
of
romance
say
on--you
are
agitated
i
am
indeed
this
revelation
has
several
times
within
the
last
few
days
trembled
on
my
lips
but
now
you
shall
have
it
because
you
ought
to
know
all
that
it
is
possible
for
me
to
tell
you
of
him
who
has
caused
you
so
serious
an
amount
of
disturbance
you
awaken
doctor
said
henry
all
my
interest
and
mine
too
remarked
the
admiral
what
can
it
be
all
about
and
where
doctor
did
you
first
see
this
varney
the
vampyre
in
his
coffin
both
the
admiral
and
henry
gave
starts
of
surprise
as
with
one
accord
they
exclaimed--
did
you
say
coffin
yes
i
tell
you
on
my
word
of
honour
that
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
saw
ever
sir
francis
varney
was
in
his
coffin
then
he
is
a
vampyre
and
there
can
be
no
mistake
said
the
admiral
go
on
i
pray
you
doctor
go
on
said
henry
anxiously
i
will
the
reason
why
he
became
the
inhabitant
of
a
coffin
was
simply
this--he
had
been
hanged--executed
at
the
old
bailey
in
london
before
ever
i
set
eyes
upon
that
strange
countenance
of
his
you
know
that
i
was
practising
surgery
at
the
london
schools
some
years
ago
and
that
consequently
as
i
commenced
the
profession
rather
late
in
life
i
was
extremely
anxious
to
do
the
most
i
could
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
yes--yes
arrived
then
with
plenty
of
resources
which
i
did
not
as
the
young
men
who
affected
to
be
studying
in
the
same
classes
as
myself
spend
in
the
pursuit
of
what
they
considered
life
in
london
i
was
indefatigable
in
my
professional
labours
and
there
was
nothing
connected
with
them
which
i
did
not
try
to
accomplish
at
that
period
the
difficulty
of
getting
a
subject
for
anatomization
was
very
great
and
all
sorts
of
schemes
had
to
be
put
into
requisition
to
accomplish
so
desirable
and
indeed
absolutely
necessary
a
purpose
i
became
acquainted
with
the
man
who
i
have
told
you
is
in
the
hall
at
present
and
who
then
filled
the
unenviable
post
of
public
executioner
it
so
happened
too
that
i
had
read
a
learned
treatise
by
a
frenchman
who
had
made
a
vast
number
of
experiments
with
galvanic
and
other
apparatus
upon
persons
who
had
come
to
death
in
different
ways
and
in
one
case
he
asserted
that
he
had
actually
recovered
a
man
who
had
been
hanged
and
he
had
lived
five
weeks
afterwards
young
as
i
then
was
in
comparison
to
what
i
am
now
in
my
profession
this
inflamed
my
imagination
and
nothing
seemed
to
me
so
desirable
as
getting
hold
of
some
one
who
had
only
recently
been
put
to
death
for
the
purpose
of
trying
what
i
could
do
in
the
way
of
attempting
a
resuscitation
of
the
subject
it
was
precisely
for
this
reason
that
i
sought
out
the
public
executioner
and
made
his
acquaintance
whom
every
one
else
shunned
because
i
thought
he
might
assist
me
by
handing
over
to
me
the
body
of
some
condemned
and
executed
man
upon
whom
i
could
try
my
skill
i
broached
the
subject
to
him
and
found
him
not
averse
he
said
that
if
i
would
come
forward
and
claim
as
next
of
kin
and
allow
the
body
to
be
removed
to
his
house
the
body
of
the
criminal
who
was
to
be
executed
the
first
time
from
that
period
that
he
could
give
me
a
hint
that
i
should
have
no
real
next
of
kin
opponents
he
would
throw
every
facility
in
my
way
this
was
just
what
i
wanted
and
i
believe
i
waited
with
impatience
for
some
poor
wretch
to
be
hurried
to
his
last
account
by
the
hands
of
my
friend
the
public
executioner
at
length
a
circumstance
occurred
which
favoured
my
designs
most
effectually--a
man
was
apprehended
for
a
highway
robbery
of
a
most
aggravated
character
he
was
tried
and
the
evidence
against
him
was
so
conclusive
that
the
defence
which
was
attempted
by
his
counsel
became
a
mere
matter
of
form
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
the
judge
told
him
not
to
flatter
himself
with
the
least
notion
that
mercy
would
be
extended
to
him
the
crime
of
which
he
had
been
found
guilty
was
on
the
increase
it
was
highly
necessary
to
make
some
great
public
example
to
show
evil
doers
that
they
could
not
with
impunity
thus
trample
upon
the
liberty
of
the
subject
and
had
suddenly
just
as
it
were
in
the
very
nick
of
time
committed
the
very
crime
attended
with
all
the
aggravated
circumstances
which
made
it
easy
and
desirable
to
hang
him
out
of
hand
he
heard
his
sentence
they
tell
me
unmoved
i
did
not
see
him
but
he
was
represented
to
me
as
a
man
of
a
strong
and
well-knit
frame
with
rather
a
strange
but
what
some
would
have
considered
a
handsome
expression
of
countenance
inasmuch
as
that
there
was
an
expression
of
much
haughty
resolution
depicted
on
it
i
flew
to
my
friend
the
executioner
'can
you'
i
said
'get
me
that
man's
body
who
is
to
be
hanged
for
the
highway
robbery
on
monday'
'yes'
he
said
'i
see
nothing
to
prevent
it
not
one
soul
has
offered
to
claim
even
common
companionship
with
him--far
less
kindred
i
think
if
you
put
in
your
claim
as
a
cousin
who
will
bear
the
expense
of
his
decent
burial
you
will
have
every
chance
of
getting
possession
of
the
body'
i
did
not
hesitate
but
on
the
morning
before
the
execution
i
called
upon
one
of
the
sheriffs
i
told
him
that
the
condemned
man
i
regretted
to
say
was
related
to
me
but
as
i
knew
nothing
could
be
done
to
save
him
on
the
trial
i
had
abstained
from
coming
forward
but
that
as
i
did
not
like
the
idea
of
his
being
rudely
interred
by
the
authorities
i
had
come
forward
to
ask
for
the
body
after
the
execution
should
have
taken
place
in
order
that
i
might
at
all
events
bestow
upon
it
in
some
sequestered
spot
a
decent
burial
with
all
the
rites
of
the
church
the
sheriff
was
a
man
not
overburthened
with
penetration
he
applauded
my
pious
feelings
and
actually
gave
me
without
any
inquiry
a
written
order
to
receive
the
body
from
the
hands
of
the
hangman
after
it
had
hung
the
hour
prescribed
by
the
law
i
did
not
as
you
may
well
suppose
wish
to
appear
more
in
the
business
than
was
absolutely
necessary
but
i
gave
the
executioner
the
sheriff's
order
for
the
body
and
he
promised
that
he
would
get
a
shell
ready
to
place
it
in
and
four
stout
men
to
carry
it
at
once
to
his
house
when
he
should
cut
it
down
'good'
i
said
'and
now
as
i
am
not
a
little
anxious
for
the
success
of
my
experiment
do
you
not
think
that
you
can
manage
so
that
the
fall
of
the
criminal
shall
not
be
so
sudden
as
to
break
his
neck'
'i
have
thought
of
that'
he
said
'and
i
believe
that
i
can
manage
to
let
him
down
gently
so
that
he
shall
die
of
suffocation
instead
of
having
his
neck
put
out
of
joint
i
will
do
my
best
'if
you
can
but
succeed
in
that'
said
i
for
i
was
quite
in
a
state
of
mania
upon
the
subject
'i
shall
be
much
indebted
to
you
and
will
double
the
amount
of
money
which
i
have
already
promised'
this
was
as
i
believed
it
would
be
a
powerful
stimulus
to
him
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
meet
my
wishes
and
he
took
no
doubt
active
measures
to
accomplish
all
that
i
desired
you
can
imagine
with
what
intense
impatience
i
waited
the
result
he
resided
in
an
old
ruinous
looking
house
a
short
distance
on
the
surrey
side
of
the
river
and
there
i
had
arranged
all
my
apparatus
for
making
experiments
upon
the
dead
man
in
an
apartment
the
windows
of
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
entrance
illustration
i
was
completely
ready
by
half-past
eight
although
a
moment's
consideration
of
course
told
me
that
at
least
another
hour
must
elapse
before
there
could
be
the
least
chance
of
my
seeing
him
arrive
for
whom
i
so
anxiously
longed
i
can
safely
say
so
infatuated
was
i
upon
the
subject
that
no
fond
lover
ever
looked
with
more
nervous
anxiety
for
the
arrival
of
the
chosen
object
of
his
heart
than
i
did
for
that
dead
body
upon
which
i
proposed
to
exert
all
the
influences
of
professional
skill
to
recall
back
the
soul
to
its
earthly
dwelling-place
at
length
i
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
i
found
that
my
friend
the
hangman
had
procured
a
cart
in
which
he
brought
the
coffin
that
being
a
much
quicker
mode
of
conveyance
than
by
bearers
so
that
about
a
quarter
past
nine
o'clock
the
vehicle
with
its
ghastly
content
stopped
at
the
door
of
his
house
in
my
impatience
i
ran
down
stairs
to
meet
that
which
ninety-nine
men
out
of
a
hundred
would
have
gone
some
distance
to
avoid
the
sight
of
namely
a
corpse
livid
and
fresh
from
the
gallows
i
however
heralded
it
as
a
great
gift
and
already
in
imagination
i
saw
myself
imitating
the
learned
frenchman
who
had
published
such
an
elaborate
treatise
on
the
mode
of
restoring
life
under
all
sorts
of
circumstances
to
those
who
were
already
pronounced
by
unscientific
persons
to
be
dead
to
be
sure
a
sort
of
feeling
had
come
over
me
at
times
knowing
as
i
did
that
the
french
are
a
nation
that
do
not
scruple
at
all
to
sacrifice
truth
on
the
altar
of
vanity
that
it
might
be
after
all
a
mere
rhodomontade
but
however
i
could
only
ascertain
so
much
by
actually
trying
so
the
suspicion
that
such
might
by
a
possibility
be
the
end
of
the
adventure
did
not
deter
me
i
officiously
assisted
in
having
the
coffin
brought
into
the
room
where
i
had
prepared
everything
that
was
necessary
in
the
conduction
of
my
grand
experiment
and
then
when
no
one
was
there
with
me
but
my
friend
the
executioner
i
with
his
help
the
one
of
us
taking
the
head
and
the
other
the
feet
took
the
body
from
the
coffin
and
laid
it
upon
a
table
hastily
i
placed
my
hand
upon
the
region
of
the
heart
and
to
my
great
delight
i
found
it
still
warm
i
drew
off
the
cap
that
covered
the
face
and
then
for
the
first
time
my
eyes
rested
upon
the
countenance
of
him
who
now
calls
himself--heaven
only
knows
why--sir
francis
varney
good
god
said
henry
are
you
certain
quite
it
may
have
been
some
other
rascal
like
him
said
the
admiral
no
i
am
quite
sure
now
i
have
as
i
have
before
mentioned
to
you
tried
to
get
out
of
my
own
conviction
upon
the
subject
but
i
have
been
actually
assured
that
he
is
the
man
by
the
very
hangman
himself
go
on
go
on
your
tale
certainly
is
a
strange
one
and
i
do
not
say
it
either
to
compliment
you
or
to
cast
a
doubt
upon
you
but
except
from
the
lips
of
an
old
and
valued
friend
such
as
you
yourself
are
i
should
not
believe
it'
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that
replied
the
doctor
nor
should
i
be
offended
even
now
if
you
were
to
entertain
a
belief
that
i
might
after
all
be
mistaken
no
no
you
would
not
be
so
positive
upon
the
subject
i
well
know
if
there
was
the
slightest
possibility
of
an
error
indeed
i
should
not
let
us
have
the
sequel
then
it
is
this
i
was
most
anxious
to
effect
an
immediate
resuscitation
if
it
were
possible
of
the
hanged
man
a
little
manipulation
soon
convinced
me
that
the
neck
was
not
broken
which
left
me
at
once
every
thing
to
hope
for
the
hangman
was
more
prudent
than
i
was
and
before
i
commenced
my
experiments
he
said--
'doctor
have
you
duly
considered
what
you
mean
to
do
with
this
fellow
in
case
you
should
be
successful
in
restoring
him
to
life'
'not
i'
said
i
'well'
he
said
'you
can
do
as
you
like
but
i
consider
that
it
is
really
worth
thinking
of'
i
was
headstrong
on
the
matter
and
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
success
or
the
non-success
in
a
physiological
point
of
view
of
my
plan
for
restoring
the
dead
to
life
so
i
set
about
my
experiments
without
any
delay
and
with
a
completeness
and
a
vigour
that
promised
the
most
completely
successful
results
if
success
could
at
all
be
an
ingredient
in
what
sober
judgment
would
doubtless
have
denominated
a
mad-headed
and
wild
scheme
for
more
than
half
an
hour
i
tried
in
vain
by
the
assistance
of
the
hangman
who
acted
under
my
directions
not
the
least
symptom
of
vitality
presented
itself
and
he
had
a
smile
upon
his
countenance
as
he
said
in
a
bantering
tone--
'i
am
afraid
sir
it
is
much
easier
to
kill
than
to
restore
their
patients
with
doctors'
before
i
could
make
him
any
reply
for
i
felt
that
his
observation
had
a
good
amount
of
truth
in
it
joined
to
its
sarcasm
the
hanged
man
uttered
a
loud
scream
and
opened
his
eyes
i
must
own
i
was
myself
rather
startled
but
i
for
some
moments
longer
continued
the
same
means
which
had
produced
such
an
effect
when
suddenly
he
sprang
up
and
laid
hold
of
me
at
the
same
time
exclaiming--
'death
death
where
is
the
treasure'
i
had
fully
succeeded--too
fully
and
while
the
executioner
looked
on
with
horror
depicted
in
his
countenance
i
fled
from
the
room
and
the
house
taking
my
way
home
as
fast
as
i
possibly
could
a
dread
came
over
me
that
the
restored
man
would
follow
me
if
he
should
find
out
to
whom
it
was
he
was
indebted
for
the
rather
questionable
boon
of
a
new
life
i
packed
up
what
articles
i
set
the
greatest
store
by
bade
adieu
to
london
and
never
have
i
since
set
foot
within
that
city
and
you
never
met
the
man
you
had
so
resuscitated
not
till
i
saw
varney
the
vampyre
and
as
i
tell
you
i
am
now
certain
that
he
is
the
man
that
is
the
strangest
yarn
that
ever
i
heard
said
the
admiral
a
most
singular
circumstance
said
henry
you
may
have
noticed
about
his
countenance
said
dr
chillingworth
a
strange
distorted
look
yes
yes
well
that
has
arisen
from
a
spasmodic
contraction
of
the
muscles
in
consequence
of
his
having
been
hanged
he
will
never
lose
it
and
it
has
not
a
little
contributed
to
give
him
the
horrible
look
he
has
and
to
invest
him
with
some
of
the
seeming
outward
attributes
of
the
vampyre
and
that
man
who
is
now
in
the
hall
with
him
doctor
said
henry
is
the
very
hangman
who
executed
him
the
same
he
tells
me
that
after
i
left
he
paid
attention
to
the
restored
man
and
completed
what
i
had
nearly
done
he
kept
him
in
his
house
for
a
time
and
then
made
a
bargain
with
him
for
a
large
sum
of
money
per
annum
all
of
which
he
has
regularly
been
paid
although
he
tells
me
he
has
no
more
idea
where
varney
gets
it
than
the
man
in
the
moon
it
is
very
strange
but
hark
do
you
not
hear
the
sound
of
voices
in
angry
altercation
yes
yes
they
have
met
let
us
approach
the
windows
now
we
may
chance
to
hear
something
of
what
they
say
to
each
other
the
altercation
between
varney
and
the
executioner
in
the
hall--the
mutual
agreement
illustration
there
was
certainly
a
loud
wrangling
in
the
hall
just
as
the
doctor
finished
his
most
remarkable
revelation
concerning
sir
francis
varney
a
revelation
which
by
no
means
attacked
the
fact
of
his
being
a
vampyre
or
not
but
rather
on
the
contrary
had
a
tendency
to
confirm
any
opinion
that
might
arise
from
the
circumstance
of
his
being
restored
to
life
after
his
execution
favourable
to
that
belief
they
all
three
now
carefully
approached
the
windows
of
the
hall
to
listen
to
what
was
going
on
and
after
a
few
moments
they
distinctly
heard
the
voice
of
the
hangman
saying
in
loud
and
rather
angry
accents--
i
do
not
deny
but
that
you
have
kept
your
word
with
me--our
bargain
has
been
as
you
say
a
profitable
one
but
still
i
cannot
see
why
that
circumstance
should
give
you
any
sort
of
control
over
my
actions
but
what
do
you
here
said
varney
impatiently
what
do
you
cried
the
other
nay
to
ask
another
question
is
not
to
answer
mine
i
tell
you
that
i
have
special
and
most
important
business
in
this
house
you
can
have
no
motive
but
curiosity
can
i
not
indeed
what
too
if
i
have
serious
and
important
business
here
impossible
well
i
may
as
easily
use
such
a
term
as
regards
what
you
call
important
business
but
here
i
shall
remain
here
you
shall
not
remain
and
will
you
make
the
somewhat
hazardous
attempt
to
force
me
to
leave
yes
much
as
i
dislike
lifting
my
hand
against
you
i
must
do
so
i
tell
you
that
i
must
be
alone
in
this
house
i
have
most
special
reasons--reasons
which
concern
my
continued
existence
your
continued
existence
you
talk
of--tell
me
now
how
is
it
that
you
have
acquired
so
frightful
a
reputation
in
this
neighbourhood
go
where
i
will
the
theme
of
conversation
is
varney
the
vampyre
and
it
is
implicitly
believed
that
you
are
one
of
those
dreadful
characters
that
feed
upon
the
life-blood
of
others
only
now
and
then
revisiting
the
tomb
to
which
you
ought
long
since
to
have
gone
in
peace
indeed
yes
what
in
the
name
of
all
that's
inexplicable
has
induced
you
to
enact
such
a
character
enact
it
you
say
can
you
then
from
all
you
have
heard
of
me
and
from
all
you
know
of
me
not
conceive
it
possible
that
i
am
not
enacting
any
such
character
why
may
it
not
be
real
look
at
me
do
i
look
like
one
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
in
sooth
you
do
not
and
yet
i
am
as
you
see
upon
it
do
not
with
an
affected
philosophy
doubt
all
that
may
happen
to
be
in
any
degree
repugnant
to
your
usual
experiences
i
am
not
one
disposed
to
do
so
nor
am
i
prepared
to
deny
that
such
dreadful
beings
may
exist
as
vampyres
however
whether
or
not
you
belong
to
so
frightful
a
class
of
creatures
i
do
not
intend
to
leave
here
but
i
will
make
an
agreement
with
you
varney
was
silent
and
after
a
few
moments'
pause
the
other
exclaimed--
there
are
people
even
now
watching
the
place
and
no
doubt
you
have
been
seen
coming
into
it
no
no
i
was
satisfied
no
one
was
here
but
you
then
you
are
wrong
a
doctor
chillingworth
of
whom
you
know
something
is
here
and
him
you
have
said
you
would
do
no
harm
to
even
to
save
your
life
i
do
know
him
you
told
me
that
it
was
to
him
that
i
was
mainly
indebted
for
my
mere
existence
and
although
i
do
not
consider
human
life
to
be
a
great
boon
i
cannot
bring
myself
to
raise
my
hand
against
the
man
who
whatever
might
have
been
the
motives
for
the
deed
at
all
events
did
snatch
me
from
the
grave
upon
my
word
whispered
the
admiral
there
is
something
about
that
fellow
that
i
like
after
all
hush
said
henry
listen
to
them
this
would
all
have
been
unintelligible
to
us
if
you
had
not
related
to
us
what
you
have
i
have
just
told
you
in
time
said
chillingworth
it
seems
will
you
then
said
the
hangman
listen
to
proposals
yes
said
varney
come
along
then
and
i
will
show
you
what
i
have
been
about
and
i
rather
think
you
have
already
a
shrewd
guess
as
to
my
motive
this
way--this
way
they
moved
off
to
some
other
part
of
the
mansion
and
the
sound
of
their
voices
gradually
died
away
so
that
after
all
the
friends
had
not
got
the
least
idea
of
what
that
motive
was
which
still
induced
the
vampyre
and
the
hangman
rather
than
leave
the
other
on
the
premises
to
make
an
agreement
to
stay
with
each
other
what's
to
be
done
now
said
henry
wait
said
dr
chillingworth
wait
and
watch
still
i
see
nothing
else
that
can
be
done
with
any
degree
of
safety
but
what
are
we
to
wait
for
said
the
admiral
by
waiting
we
shall
perhaps
find
out
was
the
doctor's
reply
but
you
may
depend
that
we
never
shall
by
interfering
well
well
be
it
so
it
seems
that
we
have
no
other
resource
and
when
either
or
both
of
those
fellows
make
their
appearance
and
seem
about
to
leave
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
they
must
be
seized
then
and
in
order
that
that
may
be
done
without
any
bloodshed
we
ought
to
have
plenty
of
force
here
henry
could
you
get
your
brother
and
charles
if
he
be
sufficiently
recovered
to
come
certainly
and
jack
pringle
no
said
the
admiral
no
jack
pringle
for
me
i
have
done
with
him
completely
and
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
strike
him
off
the
ship's
books
and
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
well
well
added
the
doctor
we
will
not
have
him
then
and
it
is
just
as
well
for
in
all
likelihood
he
would
come
drunk
and
we
shall
be--let
me
see--five
strong
without
him
which
ought
to
be
enough
to
take
prisoners
two
men
yes
said
henry
although
one
of
them
may
be
a
vampyre
that
makes
no
difference
said
the
admiral
i'd
as
soon
take
a
ship
manned
with
vampyres
as
with
frenchmen
henry
started
off
upon
his
errand
certainly
leaving
the
admiral
and
the
doctor
in
rather
a
critical
situation
while
he
was
gone
for
had
varney
the
vampyre
and
the
hangman
chosen
they
could
certainly
easily
have
overcome
so
inefficient
a
force
the
admiral
would
of
course
have
fought
and
so
might
the
doctor
as
far
as
his
hands
would
permit
him
but
if
the
others
had
really
been
intent
upon
mischief
they
could
from
their
downright
superior
physical
power
have
taken
the
lives
of
the
two
that
were
opposed
to
them
but
somehow
the
doctor
appeared
to
have
a
great
confidence
in
the
affair
whether
that
confidence
arose
from
what
the
vampyre
had
said
with
regard
to
him
or
from
any
hidden
conviction
of
his
own
that
they
would
not
yet
emerge
from
the
hall
we
cannot
say
but
certain
it
is
he
waited
the
course
of
events
with
great
coolness
no
noise
for
some
time
came
from
the
house
but
then
the
sounds
as
if
workmen
were
busy
within
it
were
suddenly
resumed
and
with
more
vigour
than
before
it
was
nearly
two
hours
before
henry
made
the
private
signal
which
had
been
agreed
upon
as
that
which
should
proclaim
his
return
and
then
he
and
his
brother
with
charles
who
when
he
heard
of
the
matter
would
notwithstanding
the
persuasions
of
flora
to
the
contrary
come
got
quietly
over
the
fence
at
a
part
of
the
garden
which
was
quite
hidden
from
the
house
by
abundant
vegetation
and
the
whole
three
of
them
took
up
a
position
that
tolerably
well
commanded
a
view
of
the
house
while
they
were
themselves
extremely
well
hidden
behind
a
dense
mass
of
evergreens
did
you
see
that
rascal
jack
pringle
said
the
admiral
yes
said
henry
he
is
drunk
ah
to
be
sure
and
we
had
no
little
difficulty
in
shaking
him
off
he
suspected
where
we
were
going
but
i
think
by
being
peremptory
we
got
fairly
rid
of
him
the
vagabond
if
he
comes
here
i'll
brain
him
i
will
the
swab
why
lately
he's
done
nothing
but
drink
that's
the
way
with
him
he'll
go
on
sometimes
for
a
year
and
more
and
not
take
more
than
enough
to
do
him
good
and
then
all
at
once
for
about
six
or
eight
weeks
he
does
nothing
but
drink
well
well
we
can
do
without
him
said
henry
without
him
i
should
think
so
do
you
hear
those
fellows
in
the
hall
at
work
d--n
me
if
i
haven't
all
of
a
sudden
thought
what
the
reason
of
it
all
is
what--what
said
the
doctor
anxiously
why
that
rascal
varney
you
know
had
his
house
burnt
down
yes
well
yes
well
i
dare
say
he
didn't
think
it
well
but
however
he
no
doubt
wants
another
so
you
see
my
idea
is
that
he's
stealing
the
material
from
bannerworth
hall
oh
is
that
your
notion
yes
and
a
very
natural
one
i
think
too
master
doctor
whatever
you
may
think
of
it
come
now
have
you
a
better
oh
dear
no
certainly
not
but
i
have
a
notion
that
something
to
eat
would
comfort
the
inward
man
much
and
so
would
something
to
drink
blow
me
if
it
wouldn't
said
jack
pringle
suddenly
making
his
appearance
the
admiral
made
a
rush
upon
him
but
he
was
restrained
by
the
others
and
jack
with
a
look
of
triumph
said--
why
what's
amiss
with
you
now
i
ain't
drunk
now
come
come
you
have
something
dangerous
in
the
wind
i
know
so
i've
made
up
my
mind
to
be
in
it
so
don't
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
if
you
think
i
don't
know
all
about
it
you
are
mistaken
for
i
do
the
vampyre
is
in
the
house
yonder
and
i'm
the
fellow
to
tackle
him
i
believe
you
my
boys
good
god
said
the
doctor
what
shall
we
do
nothing
said
jack
as
he
took
a
bottle
from
his
pocket
and
applied
the
neck
of
it
to
his
lips--nothing--nothing
at
all
there's
something
to
begin
with
said
the
admiral
as
with
his
stick
he
gave
the
bottle
a
sudden
blow
that
broke
it
and
spilt
all
its
contents
leaving
jack
petrified
with
the
bit
of
the
neck
of
it
still
in
his
mouth
my
eye
admiral
he
said
was
that
done
like
a
british
seaman
my
eye--was
that
the
trick
of
a
lubber
or
of
a
thorough-going
first-rater
first-rater
my
eye--
hold
your
noise
will
you
you
are
not
drunk
yet
and
i
was
determined
that
you
should
not
get
so
which
you
soon
would
with
that
rum-bottle
if
i
had
not
come
with
a
broadside
across
it
now
you
may
stay
but
mark
me
you
are
on
active
service
now
and
must
do
nothing
without
orders
ay
ay
your
honour
said
jack
as
he
dropped
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
looked
ruefully
upon
the
ground
from
whence
arose
the
aroma
of
rum--ay
ay
but
it's
a
hard
case
take
it
how
you
will
to
have
your
grog
stopped
but
d--n
it
i
never
had
it
stopped
yet
when
it
was
in
my
mouth
henry
and
charles
could
not
forbear
a
smile
at
jack's
discomfiture
which
however
they
were
very
glad
of
for
they
knew
full
well
his
failing
and
that
in
the
course
of
another
half
hour
he
would
have
been
drunk
and
incapable
of
being
controlled
except
as
on
some
former
occasions
by
the
exercise
of
brute
force
but
jack
was
evidently
displeased
and
considered
himself
to
be
grievously
insulted
which
after
all
was
the
better
inasmuch
as
while
he
was
brooding
over
his
wrongs
he
was
quiet
when
otherwise
it
might
have
been
a
very
difficult
matter
to
make
him
so
they
partook
of
some
refreshments
and
as
the
day
advanced
the
brothers
bannerworth
as
well
as
charles
holland
began
to
get
very
anxious
upon
the
subject
of
the
proceedings
of
sir
francis
varney
in
the
hall
they
conversed
in
low
tones
exhausting
every
as
they
considered
possible
conjecture
to
endeavour
to
account
for
his
mysterious
predilection
for
that
abode
but
nothing
occurred
to
them
of
a
sufficiently
probable
motive
to
induce
them
to
adopt
it
as
a
conclusion
they
more
than
suspected
dr
chillingworth
because
he
was
so
silent
and
hazarded
no
conjecture
at
all
of
knowing
something
or
of
having
formed
to
himself
some
highly
probable
hypothesis
upon
the
subject
but
they
could
not
get
him
to
agree
that
such
was
the
case
when
they
challenged
him
upon
the
subject
all
he
would
say
was--
my
good
friends
you
perceive
that
there
is
a
great
mystery
somewhere
and
i
do
hope
that
to-night
it
will
be
cleared
up
satisfactorily
with
this
they
were
compelled
to
be
satisfied
and
now
the
soft
and
sombre
shades
of
evening
began
to
creep
over
the
scene
enveloping
all
objects
in
the
dimness
and
repose
of
early
night
the
noise
from
the
house
had
ceased
and
all
was
profoundly
still
but
more
than
once
henry
fancied
he
heard
footsteps
outside
the
garden
he
mentioned
his
suspicions
to
charles
holland
who
immediately
said--
the
same
thing
has
come
to
my
ears
indeed
then
it
must
be
so
we
cannot
both
of
us
have
merely
imagined
such
a
thing
you
may
depend
that
this
place
is
beleaguered
in
some
way
and
that
to-night
will
be
productive
of
events
which
will
throw
a
great
light
upon
the
affairs
connected
with
this
vampyre
that
have
hitherto
baffled
conjecture
hush
said
charles
there
again
i
am
quite
confident
i
heard
a
sound
as
of
a
broken
twig
outside
the
garden-wall
the
doctor
and
the
admiral
are
in
deep
discussion
about
something--shall
we
tell
them
no
let
us
listen
as
yet
they
bent
all
their
attention
to
listening
inclining
their
ears
towards
the
ground
and
after
a
few
moments
they
felt
confident
that
more
than
one
footstep
was
creeping
along
as
cautiously
as
possible
under
the
garden
wall
after
a
few
moments'
consultation
henry
made
up
his
mind--he
being
the
best
acquainted
with
the
localities
of
the
place--to
go
and
reconnoitre
so
he
without
saying
anything
to
the
doctor
or
the
admiral
glided
from
where
he
was
in
the
direction
of
a
part
of
the
fence
which
he
knew
he
could
easily
scale
the
vampyre's
danger--the
last
refuge--the
ruse
of
henry
bannerworth
illustration
yet
knowing
to
what
deeds
of
violence
the
passions
of
a
lawless
mob
will
sometimes
lead
them
and
having
the
experience
of
what
had
been
attempted
by
the
alarmed
and
infuriated
populace
on
a
former
occasion
against
the
hall
henry
bannerworth
was
reasonably
enough
not
without
his
fears
that
something
might
occur
of
a
nature
yet
highly
dangerous
to
the
stability
of
his
ancient
house
he
did
not
actually
surmount
the
fence
but
he
crept
so
close
to
it
that
he
could
get
over
in
a
moment
if
he
wished
and
if
any
one
should
move
or
speak
on
the
other
side
he
should
be
quite
certain
to
hear
them
for
a
few
moments
all
was
still
and
then
suddenly
he
heard
some
one
say
in
a
low
voice
hist
hist
did
you
hear
nothing
i
thought
i
did
said
another
but
i
now
am
doubtful
listen
again
what
thought
henry
can
be
the
motives
of
these
men
lying
secreted
here
it
is
most
extraordinary
what
they
can
possibly
want
unless
they
are
brewing
danger
for
the
hall
most
cautiously
now
he
raised
himself
so
that
his
eyes
could
just
look
over
the
fence
and
then
indeed
he
was
astonished
he
had
expected
to
see
two
or
three
persons
at
the
utmost
what
was
his
surprise
to
find
a
compact
mass
of
men
crouching
down
under
the
garden
wall
as
far
as
his
eye
could
reach
for
a
few
moments
he
was
so
surprised
that
he
continued
to
gaze
on
heedless
of
the
danger
there
might
be
from
a
discovery
that
he
was
playing
the
part
of
a
spy
upon
them
when
however
his
first
sensations
of
surprise
were
over
he
cautiously
removed
to
his
former
position
and
just
as
he
did
so
he
heard
those
who
had
before
spoken
again
in
low
tones
breaking
the
stillness
of
the
night
i
am
resolved
upon
it
said
one
i
am
quite
determined
i
will
please
god
rid
the
country
of
that
dreadful
man
don't
call
him
a
man
said
the
oilier
well
well
it
is
a
wrong
name
to
apply
to
a
vampyre
it
is
varney
after
all
then
said
henry
bannerworth
to
himself--it
is
his
life
that
they
seek
what
can
be
done
to
save
him--for
saved
he
shall
be
if
i
can
compass
such
an
object
i
feel
that
there
is
yet
a
something
in
his
character
which
is
entitled
to
consideration
and
he
shall
not
be
savagely
murdered
while
i
have
an
arm
to
raise
in
his
defence
but
if
anything
is
now
to
be
done
it
must
be
done
by
stratagem
for
the
enemy
are
by
far
in
too
great
force
to
be
personally
combatted
with
henry
resolved
to
take
the
advice
of
his
friends
and
with
that
view
he
went
silently
and
quietly
back
to
where
they
were
and
communicated
to
them
the
news
that
he
had
so
unexpectedly
discovered
they
were
all
much
surprised
and
then
the
doctor
said
you
may
depend
that
since
the
disappointment
of
the
mob
in
the
destruction
of
this
place
they
have
had
their
eye
upon
varney
he
has
been
dogged
here
by
some
one
and
then
by
degrees
that
assemblage
has
sought
the
spot
he's
a
doomed
man
then
remarked
the
admiral
for
what
can
save
him
from
a
determined
number
of
persons
who
by
main
force
will
overcome
us
let
us
make
what
stand
we
may
in
his
defence
is
there
no
hiding-place
in
the
house
said
charles
where
you
might
after
warning
him
of
his
danger
conceal
him
there
are
plenty
but
of
what
avail
would
that
be
if
they
burn
down
the
hall
which
in
all
probability
they
will
none
certainly
there
is
but
one
chance
said
henry
and
that
is
to
throw
them
off
the
scent
and
induce
them
to
think
that
he
whom
they
seek
is
not
here
i
think
that
may
possibly
be
done
by
boldness
but
how
i
will
go
among
them
and
make
the
effort
he
at
once
left
the
friends
for
he
felt
that
there
might
be
no
time
to
lose
and
hastening
to
the
same
part
of
the
wall
over
which
he
had
looked
so
short
a
time
before
he
clambered
over
it
and
cried
in
a
loud
voice
stop
the
vampyre
stop
the
vampyre
where
where
shouted
a
number
of
persons
at
once
turning
their
eyes
eagerly
towards
the
spot
where
henry
stood
there
across
the
fields
cried
henry
i
have
lain
in
wait
for
him
long
but
he
has
eluded
me
and
is
making
his
way
again
towards
the
old
ruins
where
i
am
sure
he
has
some
hiding-place
that
he
thinks
will
elude
all
search
there
i
see
his
dusky
form
speeding
onwards
come
on
cried
several
to
the
ruins
to
the
ruins
we'll
smoke
him
out
if
he
will
not
come
by
fair
means
we
must
have
him
dead
or
alive
yes
to
the
ruins
shouted
the
throng
of
persons
who
up
to
this
time
had
preserved
so
cautious
a
silence
and
in
a
few
moments
more
henry
bannerworth
had
the
satisfaction
of
finding
that
his
ruse
had
been
perfectly
successful
for
bannerworth
hall
and
its
vicinity
were
completely
deserted
and
the
mob
in
a
straggling
mass
went
over
hedge
and
ditch
towards
those
ruins
in
which
there
was
nothing
to
reward
the
exertions
they
might
choose
to
make
in
the
way
of
an
exploration
of
them
but
the
dead
body
of
the
villain
marchdale
who
had
come
there
to
so
dreadful
but
so
deserved
a
death
the
discovery
of
the
body
of
marchdale
in
the
ruins
by
the
mob--the
burning
of
the
corpse--the
murder
of
the
hangman
illustration
the
mob
reached
the
ruins
of
bannerworth
hall
and
crowded
round
it
on
all
sides
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
if
a
human
creature
dead
or
alive
were
there
various
surmises
were
afloat
and
some
were
for
considering
that
everybody
but
themselves
or
their
friends
must
be
nothing
less
than
vampyres
indeed
a
strange
man
suddenly
appearing
among
them
would
have
caused
a
sensation
and
a
ring
would
no
doubt
have
been
formed
round
him
and
then
a
hasty
council
held
or
what
was
more
probable
some
shout
or
word
uttered
by
some
one
behind
who
could
not
understand
what
was
going
on
in
front
would
have
determined
them
to
commit
some
desperate
outrage
and
the
sacrifice
of
life
would
have
been
the
inevitable
result
of
such
an
unfortunate
concurrence
of
circumstances
there
was
a
pause
before
anyone
ventured
among
the
ruins
the
walls
were
carefully
looked
to
and
in
more
than
one
instance
but
they
were
found
dangerous
what
were
remaining
some
parts
had
been
so
completely
destroyed
that
there
were
nothing
but
heaps
of
rubbish
however
curiosity
was
exerted
to
such
an
extraordinary
pitch
that
it
overcame
the
fear
of
danger
in
search
of
the
horrible
for
they
believed
that
if
there
were
any
one
in
the
ruins
he
must
be
a
vampyre
of
course
and
they
were
somewhat
cautious
in
going
near
such
a
creature
lest
in
so
doing
they
should
meet
with
some
accident
and
become
vampyres
too
this
was
a
dreadful
reflection
and
one
that
every
now
and
then
impressed
itself
upon
the
individuals
composing
the
mob
but
at
the
same
time
any
new
impulse
or
a
shout
and
they
immediately
became
insensible
to
all
fear
the
mere
impulse
is
the
dominant
one
and
then
all
is
forgotten
the
scene
was
an
impressive
one
the
beautiful
house
and
grounds
looked
desolate
and
drear
many
of
the
trees
were
stripped
and
broken
down
and
many
scorched
and
burned
while
the
gardens
and
flower
beds
the
delight
of
the
bannerworth
family
were
rudely
trodden
under
foot
by
the
rabble
and
all
those
little
beauties
so
much
admired
and
tended
by
the
inhabitants
were
now
utterly
destroyed
and
in
such
a
state
that
their
site
could
not
even
be
detected
by
the
former
owners
it
was
a
sad
sight
to
see
such
a
sacrilege
committed--such
violence
done
to
private
feelings
as
to
have
all
these
places
thrown
open
to
the
scrutiny
of
the
brutal
and
vulgar
who
are
incapable
of
appreciating
or
understanding
the
pleasures
of
a
refined
taste
the
ruins
presented
a
remarkable
contrast
to
what
the
place
had
been
but
a
very
short
time
before
and
now
the
scene
of
desolation
was
complete
there
was
no
one
spot
in
which
the
most
wretched
could
find
shelter
to
be
sure
under
the
lee
of
some
broken
and
crumbling
wall
that
tottered
rather
than
stood
a
huddled
wretch
might
have
found
shelter
from
the
wind
but
it
would
have
been
at
the
risk
of
his
life
and
not
there
complete
the
mob
became
quiet
for
some
moments
but
was
not
so
long
indeed
a
mob
of
people--which
is
in
fact
always
composed
of
the
most
disorderly
characters
to
be
found
in
a
place
is
not
exactly
the
assembly
that
is
most
calculated
for
quietness
somebody
gave
a
shout
and
then
somebody
else
shouted
and
the
one
wide
throat
of
the
whole
concourse
was
opened
and
sent
forth
a
mighty
yell
after
this
exhibition
of
power
they
began
to
run
about
like
mad--traverse
the
grounds
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
then
the
ruins
were
in
progress
of
being
explored
this
was
a
tender
affair
and
had
to
be
done
with
some
care
and
caution
by
those
who
were
so
engaged
and
they
walked
over
crumbling
and
decayed
masses
in
one
or
two
places
they
saw
what
appeared
to
be
large
holes
into
which
the
building
materials
had
been
sunk
by
their
own
weight
through
the
flooring
that
seemed
as
roofs
to
some
cellars
or
dungeons
seeing
this
they
knew
not
how
soon
some
other
part
might
sink
in
and
carry
their
precious
bodies
down
with
the
mass
of
rubbish
this
gave
an
interest
to
the
scene--a
little
danger
is
a
sort
of
salt
to
an
adventure
and
enables
those
who
have
taken
part
in
it
to
talk
of
their
exploits
and
of
their
dangers
which
is
pleasant
to
do
and
to
hear
in
the
ale-house
and
by
the
inglenook
in
the
winter
however
when
a
few
had
gone
some
distance
others
followed
when
they
saw
them
enter
the
place
in
safety
and
at
length
the
whole
ruins
were
covered
with
living
men
and
not
a
few
women
who
seemed
necessary
to
make
up
the
elements
of
mischief
in
this
case
there
were
some
shouting
and
hallooing
from
one
to
the
other
as
they
hurried
about
the
ruins
at
length
they
had
explored
the
ruins
nearly
all
over
when
one
man
who
had
stood
a
few
minutes
upon
a
spot
gazing
intently
upon
something
suddenly
exclaimed--
hilloa
hurrah
here
we
are
altogether--come
on--i've
found
him--i've
found--recollect
it's
me
and
nobody
else
has
found--hurrah
then
with
a
wild
kind
of
frenzy
he
threw
his
hat
up
into
the
air
as
if
to
attract
attention
and
call
others
round
him
to
see
what
it
was
he
had
found
what's
the
matter
bill
exclaimed
one
who
came
up
to
him
and
who
had
been
close
at
hand
the
matter
why
i've
found
him
that's
the
matter
old
man
replied
the
first
what
a
whale
no
a
wampyre
the
blessed
wampyre
there
he
is--don't
you
see
him
under
them
ere
bricks
oh
that's
not
him
he
got
away
i
don't
care
replied
the
other
who
got
away
or
who
didn't
i
know
this
much
that
he's
a
wampyre--he
wouldn't
be
there
if
he
warn't
this
was
an
unanswerable
argument
and
nobody
could
deny
it
consequently
there
was
a
cessation
of
talk
and
the
people
then
came
up
as
the
two
first
were
looking
at
the
body
whose
is
it
inquired
a
dozen
voices
illustration
not
sir
francis
varney's
said
the
second
speaker
the
clothes
are
not
his--
no
no
not
sir
francis's
but
i
tell
you
what
mates
said
the
first
speaker
that
if
it
isn't
sir
francis
varney's
it
is
somebody
else's
as
bad
i
dare
say
now
he's
a
wictim
a
what
a
wictim
to
the
wampyre
and
if
he
sees
the
blessed
moonlight
he
will
be
a
wampyre
hisself
and
so
shall
we
be
too
if
he
puts
his
teeth
into
us
so
we
shall--so
we
shall
said
the
mob
and
their
flesh
begin
to
run
cold
and
there
was
a
feeling
of
horror
creeping
over
the
whole
body
of
persons
within
hearing
i
tell
you
what
it
is
our
only
plan
will
be
to
get
him
out
of
the
ruins
then
remarked
another
what
said
one
who's
going
to
handle
such
cattle
if
you've
a
sore
about
you
and
his
blood
touches
you
who's
to
say
you
won't
be
a
vampyre
too
no
no
you
won't
said
an
old
woman
i
won't
try
was
the
happy
rejoinder
i
ain't
a-going
to
carry
a
wampyre
on
my
two
legs
home
to
my
wife
and
small
family
of
seven
children
and
another
a-coming
there
was
a
pause
for
a
few
moments
and
then
one
man
more
adventurous
than
the
rest
exclaimed--
well
vampyre
or
no
vampyre
his
dead
body
can
harm
no
one
so
here
goes
to
get
it
out
help
me
who
will
once
have
it
out
and
then
we
can
prevent
any
evil
by
burning
it
and
thus
destroying
the
whole
body
hurrah
shouted
three
or
four
more
as
they
jumped
down
into
the
hole
formed
by
the
falling
in
of
the
materials
which
had
crushed
marchdale
to
death
for
it
was
his
body
they
had
discovered
they
immediately
set
to
work
to
displace
such
of
the
materials
as
lay
on
the
body
and
then
having
cleared
it
of
all
superincumbent
rubbish
they
proceeded
to
lift
it
up
but
found
that
it
had
got
entangled
as
they
called
it
with
some
chains
with
some
trouble
they
got
them
off
and
the
body
was
lifted
out
to
a
higher
spot
now
what's
to
be
done
inquired
one
burn
it
said
another
hurrah
shouted
a
female
voice
we've
got
the
wampyre
run
a
stake
through
his
body
and
then
place
him
upon
some
dry
wood--there's
plenty
to
be
had
about
here
i
am
sure--and
then
burn
him
to
a
cinder
that's
right
old
woman--that's
right
said
a
man
nothing
better
the
devil
must
be
in
him
if
he
come
to
life
after
that
i
should
say
there
might
be
something
in
that
and
the
mob
shouted
its
approbation
as
it
was
sure
to
do
as
anything
stupid
or
senseless
and
the
proposal
might
be
said
to
have
been
carried
by
acclamation
and
it
required
only
the
execution
this
was
soon
done
there
were
plenty
of
laths
and
rafters
and
the
adjoining
wood
furnished
an
abundant
supply
of
dry
sticks
so
there
was
no
want
of
fuel
there
was
a
loud
shout
as
each
accession
of
sticks
took
place
and
as
each
individual
threw
his
bundle
into
the
heap
each
man
felt
all
the
self-devotion
to
the
task
as
the
scottish
chieftain
who
sacrificed
himself
and
seven
sons
in
the
battle
for
his
superior
and
when
one
son
was
cut
down
the
man
filled
up
his
place
with
the
exclamation--another
for
hector
until
he
himself
fell
as
the
last
of
his
race
soon
now
the
heap
became
prodigious
and
it
required
an
effort
to
get
the
mangled
corpse
upon
this
funeral
bier
but
it
was
then
a
shout
from
the
mob
that
rent
the
air
announced
both
the
fact
and
their
satisfaction
the
next
thing
to
be
done
was
to
light
the
pile--this
was
no
easy
task
but
like
all
others
it
was
accomplished
and
the
dead
body
of
the
vampyre's
victim
was
thrown
on
to
prevent
that
becoming
a
vampyre
too
in
its
turn
there
boys
said
one
he'll
not
see
the
moonlight
that's
certain
and
the
sooner
we
put
a
light
to
this
the
better
for
it
may
be
the
soldiers
will
be
down
upon
us
before
we
know
anything
of
it
so
now
who's
got
a
light
this
was
a
question
that
required
a
deal
of
searching
but
at
length
one
was
found
by
one
of
the
mob
coming
forward
and
after
drawing
his
pipe
vigorously
for
some
moments
he
collected
some
scraps
of
paper
upon
which
he
emptied
the
contents
of
the
pipe
with
the
hope
they
would
take
fire
in
this
however
he
was
doomed
to
disappointment
for
it
produced
nothing
but
a
deal
of
smoke
and
the
paper
burned
without
producing
any
flame
this
act
of
disinterestedness
however
was
not
without
its
due
consequences
for
there
were
several
who
had
pipes
and
fired
with
the
hope
of
emulating
the
first
projector
of
the
scheme
for
raising
the
flame
they
joined
together
and
potting
the
contents
of
their
pipes
together
on
some
paper
straw
and
chips
they
produced
after
some
little
trouble
a
flame
then
there
was
a
shout
and
the
burning
mass
was
then
placed
in
a
favourable
position
nearer
the
pile
of
materials
collected
for
burning
and
then
in
a
few
moments
it
began
to
take
light
one
piece
communicated
the
fire
to
another
until
the
whole
was
in
a
blaze
when
the
first
flame
fairly
reached
the
top
a
loud
and
tremendous
shout
arose
from
the
mob
and
the
very
welkin
re-echoed
with
its
fulness
then
the
forked
flames
rushed
through
the
wood
and
hissed
and
crackled
as
they
flew
throwing
up
huge
masses
of
black
smoke
and
casting
a
peculiar
reflection
around
not
a
sound
was
heard
save
the
hissing
and
roaring
of
the
flames
which
seemed
like
the
approaching
of
a
furious
whirlwind
at
length
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
blackened
mass
it
was
enveloped
in
one
huge
flame
that
threw
out
a
great
heat
so
much
so
that
those
nearest
to
it
felt
induced
to
retire
from
before
it
i
reckon
said
one
that
he's
pretty
well
done
by
this
time--he's
had
a
warm
berth
of
it
up
there
yes
said
another
farmer
walkings's
sheep
he
roasted
whole
at
last
harvest-home
hadn't
such
a
fire
as
this
i'll
warrant
there's
no
such
fire
in
the
county--why
it
would
prevent
a
frost
i
do
believe
it
would
so
it
would
neighbour
answered
another
yes
replied
a
third
but
you'd
want
such
a
one
corner
of
each
field
though





there
was
much
talk
and
joking
going
on
among
the
men
who
stood
around
in
the
midst
of
which
however
they
were
disturbed
by
a
loud
shout
and
upon
looking
in
the
quarter
whence
it
came
they
saw
stealing
from
among
the
ruins
the
form
of
a
man
he
was
a
strange
odd
looking
man
and
at
the
time
it
was
very
doubtful
among
the
mob
as
to
whom
it
was--nobody
could
tell
and
more
than
one
looked
at
the
burning
pile
and
then
at
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
so
mysteriously
present
as
if
they
almost
imagined
that
the
body
had
got
away
who
is
it
exclaimed
one
danged
if
i
knows
said
another
looking
very
hard
and
very
white
at
the
same
time--i
hope
it
ain't
the
chap
what
we've
burned
here
jist
now
no
said
the
female
that
you
may
be
sure
of
for
he's
had
a
stake
through
his
body
and
as
you
said
he
can
never
get
over
that
for
as
the
stake
is
consumed
so
are
his
vitals
and
that's
a
sure
sign
he's
done
for
yes
yes
she's
right--a
vampyre
may
live
upon
blood
but
cannot
do
without
his
inside
this
was
so
obvious
to
them
all
that
it
was
at
once
conceded
and
a
general
impression
pervaded
the
mob
that
it
might
be
sir
francis
varney
a
shout
ensued
hurrah--after
him--there's
a
vampyre--there
he
goes--after
him--catch
him--burn
him
and
a
variety
of
other
exclamations
were
uttered
at
the
same
time
the
victim
of
popular
wrath
seemed
to
be
aware
that
he
was
now
discovered
and
made
off
with
all
possible
expedition
towards
some
wood
away
went
the
mob
in
pursuit
hooting
and
hallooing
like
demons
and
denouncing
the
unfortunate
being
with
all
the
terrors
that
could
be
imagined
and
which
naturally
added
greater
speed
to
the
unfortunate
man
however
some
among
the
mob
seeing
that
there
was
every
probability
of
the
stranger's
escaping
at
a
mere
match
of
speed
brought
a
little
cunning
to
bear
upon
matter
and
took
a
circuit
round
and
thus
intercepted
him
this
was
not
accomplished
without
a
desperate
effort
and
by
the
best
runners
who
thus
reached
the
spot
he
made
for
before
he
could
get
there
when
the
stranger
saw
himself
thus
intercepted
he
endeavoured
to
fly
in
a
different
direction
but
was
soon
secured
by
the
mob
who
made
somewhat
free
with
his
person
and
commenced
knocking
him
about
have
mercy
on
me
said
the
stranger
what
do
you
want
i
am
not
rich
but
take
all
i
have
what
do
you
do
here
inquired
twenty
voices
come
tell
us
that--what
do
you
do
here
and
who
are
you
a
stranger
quite
a
stranger
to
these
parts
oh
yes
he's
a
stranger
but
that's
all
the
worse
for
him--he's
a
vampyre--there's
no
doubt
about
that
good
god
said
the
man
i
am
a
living
and
breathing
man
like
yourselves
i
have
done
no
wrong
and
injured
no
man--be
merciful
unto
me
i
intend
no
harm
of
course
not
send
him
to
the
fire--take
him
back
to
the
ruins--to
the
fire
ay
and
run
a
stake
through
his
body
and
then
he's
safe
for
life
i
am
sure
he
has
something
to
do
with
the
vampyre
and
who
knows
if
he
ain't
a
vampyre
how
soon
he
may
become
one
ah
that's
very
true
bring
him
back
to
the
fire
and
we'll
try
the
effects
of
the
fire
upon
his
constitution
i
tell
you
what
neighbour
it's
my
opinion
that
as
one
fool
makes
many
so
one
vampyre
makes
many
so
it
does
so
it
does
there's
much
truth
and
reason
in
that
neighbour
i
am
decidedly
of
that
opinion
too
come
along
then
cried
the
mob
cuffing
and
pulling
the
unfortunate
stranger
with
them
mercy
mercy
but
it
was
useless
to
call
for
mercy
to
men
whose
superstitious
feelings
urged
them
on
for
when
the
demon
of
superstition
is
active
no
matter
what
form
it
may
take
it
always
results
in
cruelty
and
wickedness
to
all
various
were
the
shouts
and
menaces
of
the
mob
and
the
stranger
saw
no
hope
of
life
unless
he
could
escape
from
the
hands
of
the
people
who
surrounded
him
they
had
now
nearly
reached
the
ruins
and
the
stranger
who
was
certainly
a
somewhat
odd
and
remarkable
looking
man
and
who
appeared
in
their
eyes
the
very
impersonation
of
their
notions
of
a
vampyre
was
thrust
from
one
to
the
other
kicked
by
one
and
then
cuffed
by
the
other
as
if
he
was
doomed
to
run
the
gauntlet
down
with
the
vampyre
said
the
mob
i
am
no
vampyre
said
the
stranger
i
am
new
to
these
parts
and
i
pray
you
have
mercy
upon
me
i
have
done
you
no
wrong
hear
me--i
know
nothing
of
these
people
of
whom
you
speak
that
won't
do
you've
come
here
to
see
what
you
can
do
i
dare
say
and
though
you
may
have
been
hurt
by
the
vampyre
and
may
be
only
your
misfortune
and
not
your
fault
yet
the
mischief
is
as
great
as
ever
it
was
or
can
be
you
become
in
spite
of
yourself
a
vampyre
and
do
the
same
injury
to
others
that
has
been
done
to
you--there's
no
help
for
you
no
help--we
can't
help
it
shouted
the
mob
he
must
die--throw
him
on
the
pile
put
a
stake
through
him
first
though
exclaimed
the
humane
female
put
a
stake
through
him
and
then
he's
safe
this
horrible
advice
had
an
electric
effect
on
the
stranger
who
jumped
up
and
eluded
the
grasp
of
several
hands
that
were
stretched
forth
to
seize
him
throw
him
upon
the
burning
wood
shouted
one
and
a
stake
through
his
body
suggested
the
humane
female
again
who
seemed
to
have
this
one
idea
in
her
heart
and
no
other
and
upon
every
available
opportunity
she
seemed
to
be
anxious
to
give
utterance
to
the
comfortable
notion
seize
him
exclaimed
one
never
let
him
go
said
another
we've
gone
too
far
to
hang
back
now
and
if
he
escape
he
will
visit
us
in
our
sleep
were
it
only
out
of
spite
the
stranger
made
a
dash
among
the
ruins
and
for
a
moment
out-stripped
his
pursuers
but
a
few
more
adventurous
than
the
rest
succeeded
in
driving
him
into
an
angle
formed
by
two
walls
and
the
consequence
was
he
was
compelled
to
come
to
a
stand
seize
him--seize
him
exclaimed
all
those
at
a
distance
the
stranger
seeing
he
was
now
nearly
surrounded
and
had
no
chance
of
escape
save
by
some
great
effort
seized
a
long
piece
of
wood
and
struck
two
of
his
assailants
down
at
once
and
then
dashed
through
the
opening
he
immediately
made
for
another
part
of
the
ruins
and
succeeded
in
making
his
escape
for
some
short
distance
but
was
unable
to
keep
up
the
speed
that
was
required
for
his
great
exertion
before
had
nearly
exhausted
him
and
the
fear
of
a
cruel
death
before
his
eyes
was
not
enough
to
give
him
strength
or
lend
speed
to
his
flight
he
had
suffered
too
much
from
violence
and
though
he
ran
with
great
speed
yet
those
who
followed
were
uninjured
and
fresher--he
had
no
chance
they
came
very
close
upon
him
at
the
corner
of
a
field
which
he
endeavoured
to
cross
and
had
succeeded
in
doing
and
he
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
scramble
up
the
bank
that
divided
the
field
from
the
next
but
he
slipped
back
almost
exhausted
into
the
ditch
and
the
whole
mob
came
up
however
he
got
on
the
bank
and
leaped
into
the
next
field
and
then
he
was
immediately
surrounded
by
those
who
pursued
him
and
he
was
struck
down
down
with
the
vampyre--kill
him--he's
one
of
'em--run
a
stake
through
him
were
a
few
of
the
cries
of
the
infuriated
mob
of
people
who
were
only
infuriated
because
he
attempted
to
escape
their
murderous
intentions
it
was
strange
to
see
how
they
collected
in
a
ring
as
the
unfortunate
man
lay
on
the
ground
panting
for
breath
and
hardly
able
to
speak--their
infuriated
countenances
plainly
showing
the
mischief
they
were
intent
upon
have
mercy
upon
me
he
exclaimed
as
he
lay
on
the
earth
i
have
no
power
to
help
myself
the
mob
returned
no
answer
but
stood
collecting
their
numbers
as
they
came
up
have
mercy
on
me
it
cannot
be
any
pleasure
to
you
to
spill
my
blood
i
am
unable
to
resist--i
am
one
man
among
many--you
surely
cannot
wish
to
beat
me
to
death
we
want
to
hurt
no
one
except
in
our
own
defence
and
we
won't
be
made
vampyres
of
because
you
don't
like
to
die
no
no
we
won't
be
vampyres
exclaimed
the
mob
and
there
arose
a
great
shout
from
the
mob
are
you
men--fathers--have
you
families
if
so
i
have
the
same
ties
as
you
have
spare
me
for
their
sakes--do
not
murder
me--you
will
leave
one
an
orphan
if
you
do
besides
what
have
i
done
i
have
injured
no
one
i
tell
you
what
friends
if
we
listen
to
him
we
shall
all
be
vampyres
and
all
our
children
will
all
be
vampyres
and
orphans
so
we
shall
so
we
shall
down
with
him
the
man
attempted
to
get
up
but
in
doing
so
he
received
a
heavy
blow
from
a
hedge-stake
wielded
by
the
herculean
arm
of
a
peasant
the
sound
of
the
blow
was
heard
by
those
immediately
around
and
the
man
fell
dead
there
was
a
pause
and
those
nearest
apparently
fearful
of
the
consequences
and
hardly
expecting
the
catastrophe
began
to
disperse
and
the
remainder
did
so
very
soon
afterwards
the
vampyre's
flight--his
danger
and
the
last
place
of
refuge
illustration
leaving
the
disorderly
and
vicious
mob
who
were
thus
sacrificing
human
life
to
their
excited
passions
we
return
to
the
brothers
bannerworth
and
the
doctor
who
together
with
admiral
bell
still
held
watch
over
the
hall
no
indication
of
the
coming
forth
of
varney
presented
itself
for
some
time
longer
and
then
at
least
they
thought
they
heard
a
window
open
and
turning
their
eyes
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
proceeded
they
could
see
the
form
of
a
man
slowly
and
cautiously
emerging
from
it
as
far
as
they
could
judge
from
the
distance
at
which
they
were
that
form
partook
much
of
the
appearance
and
the
general
aspect
of
sir
francis
varney
and
the
more
they
looked
and
noticed
its
movements
the
more
they
felt
convinced
that
such
was
the
fact
there
comes
your
patient
doctor
said
the
admiral
don't
call
him
my
patient
said
the
doctor
if
you
please
why
you
know
he
is
and
you
are
in
a
manner
of
speaking
bound
to
look
after
him
well
what
is
to
be
done
he
must
not
on
any
account
said
dr
chillingworth
be
allowed
to
leave
the
place
believe
me
i
have
the
very
strongest
reasons
for
saying
so
he
shall
not
leave
it
then
said
henry
even
as
he
spoke
henry
bannerworth
darted
forward
and
sir
francis
varney
dropped
from
the
window
out
of
which
he
had
clambered
close
to
his
feet
hold
cried
henry
you
are
my
prisoner
with
the
most
imperturbable
coolness
in
the
world
sir
francis
varney
turned
upon
him
and
replied--
and
pray
henry
bannerworth
what
have
i
done
to
provoke
your
wrath
what
have
you
done--have
you
not
like
a
thief
broken
into
my
house
can
you
ask
what
you
have
done
ay
said
the
vampyre
like
a
thief
perchance
and
yet
no
thief
may
i
ask
you
what
there
is
to
steal
in
the
house
by
the
time
this
short
dialogue
had
been
uttered
the
rest
of
the
party
had
come
up
and
varney
was
so
far
as
regarded
numbers
a
prisoner
well
gentlemen
he
said
with
that
strange
contortion
of
countenance
which
now
they
all
understood
arose
from
the
fact
of
his
having
been
hanged
and
restored
to
life
again
well
gentlemen
now
that
you
have
beleaguered
me
in
such
a
way
may
i
ask
you
what
it
is
about
if
you
will
step
aside
with
me
sir
francis
varney
for
a
moment
said
dr
chillingworth
i
will
make
to
you
a
communication
which
will
enable
you
to
know
what
it
is
all
about
oh
with
pleasure
said
the
vampyre
i
am
not
ill
at
present
but
still
sir
i
have
no
objection
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
he
stepped
a
few
paces
on
one
side
with
the
doctor
while
the
others
waited
not
without
some
amount
of
impatience
for
the
result
of
the
communication
all
that
they
could
hear
was
that
varney
said
suddenly--
you
are
quite
mistaken
and
then
the
doctor
appeared
to
be
insisting
upon
something
which
the
vampyre
listened
to
patiently
and
at
the
end
burst
out
with--
why
doctor
you
must
be
dreaming
at
this
dr
chillingworth
at
once
left
him
and
advancing
to
his
friends
he
said--
sir
francis
varney
denies
in
toto
all
that
i
have
related
to
you
concerning
him
therefore
i
can
say
no
more
than
that
i
earnestly
recommend
you
before
you
let
him
go
to
see
that
he
takes
nothing
of
value
with
him
why
what
can
you
mean
said
varney
search
him
said
the
doctor
i
will
tell
you
why
very
shortly
indeed--indeed
said
sir
francis
varney
now
gentlemen
i
will
give
you
a
chance
of
behaving
justly
and
quietly
so
saving
yourself
the
danger
of
acting
otherwise
i
have
made
repeated
offers
to
take
this
house
either
as
a
tenant
or
as
a
purchaser
all
of
which
offers
have
been
declined
upon
i
dare
say
a
common
enough
principle
namely
one
which
induces
people
to
enhance
the
value
of
anything
they
have
for
disposal
if
it
be
unique
by
making
it
difficult
to
come
at
seeing
that
you
had
deserted
the
place
i
could
make
no
doubt
but
that
it
was
to
be
had
so
i
came
here
to
make
a
thorough
examination
of
its
interior
to
see
if
it
would
suit
me
i
find
that
it
will
not
therefore
i
have
only
to
apologise
for
the
intrusion
and
to
wish
you
a
remarkably
good
evening
that
won't
do
said
the
doctor
what
won't
do
sir
this
excuse
will
not
do
sir
francis
varney
you
are
although
you
deny
it
the
man
who
was
hanged
in
london
some
years
ago
for
a
highway
robbery
varney
laughed
and
held
up
his
hands
exclaiming--
alas
alas
our
good
friend
the
doctor
has
studied
too
hard
his
wits
probably
at
the
best
of
times
none
of
the
clearest
have
become
hopelessly
entangled
do
you
deny
said
henry
then
that
you
are
that
man
most
unequivocally
i
assert
it
said
the
doctor
and
now
i
will
tell
you
all
for
i
perceive
you
hesitate
about
searching
sir
francis
varney
i
tell
you
all
why
it
is
that
he
has
such
an
affection
for
bannerworth
hall
before
you
do
said
varney
there
is
a
pill
for
you
which
you
may
find
more
nauseous
and
harder
of
digestion
than
any
your
shop
can
furnish
as
varney
uttered
these
words
he
suddenly
drew
from
his
pocket
a
pistol
and
levelling
it
at
the
unfortunate
doctor
he
fired
it
full
at
him
the
act
was
so
sudden
so
utterly
unexpected
and
so
stunning
that
it
was
done
before
any
one
could
move
hand
or
foot
to
prevent
it
henry
bannerworth
and
his
brother
were
the
furthest
off
from
the
vampyre
and
unhappily
in
the
rush
which
they
as
soon
us
possible
made
towards
him
they
knocked
down
the
admiral
who
impeded
them
much
and
before
they
could
spring
over
or
past
him
sir
francis
varney
was
gone
so
sudden
too
had
been
his
departure
that
they
had
not
the
least
idea
in
which
direction
he
had
gone
so
that
to
follow
him
would
have
been
a
work
of
the
greatest
possible
difficulty
notwithstanding
however
both
the
difficulty
and
the
danger
for
no
doubt
the
vampyre
was
well
enough
armed
henry
and
his
brother
both
rushed
after
the
murderer
as
they
now
believed
him
to
be
in
the
route
which
they
thought
it
was
most
probable
he
would
take
namely
that
which
led
towards
the
garden
gate
they
reached
that
spot
in
a
few
moments
but
all
was
profoundly
still
not
the
least
trace
of
any
one
could
be
seen
high
or
low
and
they
were
compelled
after
a
cursory
examination
to
admit
that
sir
francis
varney
had
again
made
his
escape
despite
the
great
odds
that
were
against
him
in
point
of
numbers
he
has
gone
said
henry
let
us
go
back
and
see
into
the
state
of
poor
dr
chillingworth
who
i
fear
is
a
dead
man
they
hurried
back
to
the
spot
and
there
they
found
the
admiral
looking
as
composed
as
possible
and
solacing
himself
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
as
he
gazed
upon
the
apparently
lifeless
form
at
his
feet
is
he
dead
said
henry
i
should
say
he
was
replied
the
admiral
such
a
shot
as
that
was
don't
want
to
be
repeated
well
i
liked
the
doctor
with
all
his
faults
he
only
had
one
foolish
way
with
him
and
that
was
that
he
shirked
his
grog
this
is
an
awful
catastrophe
said
henry
as
he
knelt
down
by
the
side
of
the
body
assist
me
some
of
you
where
is
charles
i'll
be
hanged
said
the
admiral
if
i
know
he
disappeared
somewhere
this
is
a
night
of
mystery
as
well
as
terror
alas
poor
dr
chillingworth
i
little
thought
that
you
would
have
fallen
a
victim
to
the
man
whom
you
preserved
from
death
how
strange
it
is
that
you
should
have
snatched
from
the
tomb
the
very
individual
who
was
eventually
to
take
your
own
life
the
brothers
gently
raised
the
body
of
the
doctor
and
carried
it
on
to
the
glass
plot
which
was
close
at
hand
farewell
kind
and
honest-hearted
chillingworth
said
henry
i
shall
many
and
many
a
time
feel
your
loss
and
now
i
will
rest
not
until
i
have
delivered
up
to
justice
your
murderer
all
consideration
or
feeling
for
what
seemed
to
be
latent
virtues
in
that
strange
and
inexplicable
man
varney
shall
vanish
and
he
shall
reap
the
consequences
of
the
crime
he
has
now
committed
it
was
a
cold
blooded
cowardly
murder
said
his
brother
it
was
but
you
may
depend
the
doctor
was
about
to
reveal
something
to
us
which
varney
so
much
dreaded
that
he
took
his
life
as
the
only
effectual
way
at
the
moment
of
stopping
him
it
must
be
so
said
henry
and
now
said
the
admiral
it's
too
late
and
we
shall
not
know
it
at
all
that's
the
way
a
fellow
saves
up
what
he
has
got
to
tell
till
it
is
too
late
to
tell
it
and
down
he
goes
to
davy
jones's
locker
with
all
his
secrets
aboard
not
always
said
dr
chillingworth
suddenly
sitting
bolt
upright--not
always
henry
and
his
brother
started
back
in
amazement
and
the
admiral
was
so
taken
by
surprise
that
had
not
the
resuscitated
doctor
suddenly
stretched
out
his
hand
and
laid
hold
of
him
by
the
ankle
he
would
have
made
a
precipitate
retreat
hilloa
murder
he
cried
let
me
go
how
do
i
know
but
you
may
be
a
vampyre
by
now
as
you
were
shot
by
one
henry
soonest
recovered
from
the
surprise
of
the
moment
and
with
the
most
unfeigned
satisfaction
he
cried--
thank
god
you
are
unhurt
dr
chillingworth
why
he
must
have
missed
you
by
a
miracle
not
at
all
said
the
doctor
help
me
up--thank
you--all
right
i'm
only
a
little
singed
about
the
whiskers
he
hit
me
safe
enough
then
how
have
you
escaped
why
from
the
want
of
a
bullet
in
the
pistol
to
be
sure
i
can
understand
it
all
well
enough
he
wanted
to
create
sufficient
confusion
to
cover
a
desperate
attempt
to
escape
and
he
thought
that
would
be
best
done
by
seeming
so
shoot
me
the
suddenness
of
the
shock
and
the
full
belief
at
the
moment
that
he
had
sent
a
bullet
into
my
brains
made
me
fall
and
produced
a
temporary
confusion
of
ideas
amounting
to
insensibility
from
which
you
are
happily
recovered
thank
heaven
that
after
all
he
is
not
such
a
villain
as
this
act
would
have
made
him
ah
said
the
admiral
it
takes
people
who
have
lived
a
little
in
these
affairs
to
know
the
difference
in
sound
between
a
firearm
with
a
bullet
in
it
and
one
without
i
knew
it
was
all
right
then
why
did
you
not
say
so
admiral
what
was
the
use
i
thought
the
doctor
might
be
amused
to
know
what
you
should
say
of
him
so
you
see
i
didn't
interfere
and
as
i
am
not
a
good
hand
at
galloping
after
anybody
i
didn't
try
that
part
of
the
business
but
just
remained
where
i
was
alas
alas
cried
the
doctor
i
much
fear
that
by
his
going
i
have
lost
all
that
i
expected
to
be
able
to
do
for
you
henry
it's
of
not
the
least
use
now
telling
you
or
troubling
you
about
it
you
may
now
sell
or
let
bannerworth
hall
to
whomever
you
please
for
i
am
afraid
it
is
really
worthless
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
said
henry
why
doctor
will
you
keep
up
this
mystery
among
us
if
you
have
anything
to
say
why
not
say
it
at
once
because
i
tell
you
it's
of
no
use
now
the
game
is
up
sir
francis
varney
has
escaped
but
still
i
don't
know
that
i
need
exactly
hesitate
there
can
be
no
reason
for
your
hesitating
about
making
a
communication
to
us
said
henry
it
is
unfriendly
not
to
do
so
my
dear
boy
you
will
excuse
me
for
saying
that
you
don't
know
what
you
are
talking
about
can
you
give
any
reason
yes
respect
for
the
living
i
should
have
to
relate
something
of
the
dead
which
would
be
hurtful
to
their
feelings
henry
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
he
said--
what
dead
and
who
are
the
living
another
time
whispered
the
doctor
to
him
another
time
henry
do
not
press
me
now
but
you
shall
know
all
another
time
i
must
be
content
but
now
let
us
remember
that
another
man
yet
lingers
in
bannerworth
hall
i
will
endure
suspense
on
his
account
no
longer
he
is
an
intruder
there
so
i
go
at
once
to
dislodge
him
no
one
made
any
opposition
to
this
move
not
even
the
doctor
so
henry
preceded
them
all
to
the
house
they
passed
through
the
open
window
into
the
long
hall
and
from
thence
into
every
apartment
of
the
mansion
without
finding
the
object
of
their
search
but
from
one
of
the
windows
up
to
which
there
grew
great
masses
of
ivy
there
hung
a
rope
by
which
any
one
might
easily
have
let
himself
down
and
no
doubt
therefore
existed
in
all
their
minds
that
the
hangman
had
sufficiently
profited
by
the
confusion
incidental
to
the
supposed
shooting
of
the
doctor
to
make
good
his
escape
from
the
place
and
so
after
all
said
henry
we
are
completely
foiled
we
may
be
said
dr
chillingworth
but
it
is
perhaps
going
too
far
to
say
that
we
actually
are
one
thing
however
is
quite
clear
and
that
is
no
good
can
be
done
here
then
let
us
go
home
said
the
admiral
i
did
not
think
from
the
first
that
any
good
would
be
done
here
they
all
left
the
garden
together
now
so
that
almost
for
the
first
time
bannerworth
hall
was
left
to
itself
unguarded
and
unwatched
by
any
one
whatever
it
was
with
an
evident
and
a
marked
melancholy
that
the
doctor
proceeded
with
the
party
to
the
cottage-house
of
the
bannerworths
but
as
after
what
he
had
said
henry
forbore
to
question
him
further
upon
those
subjects
which
he
admitted
he
was
keeping
secret
and
as
none
of
the
party
were
much
in
a
cue
for
general
conversation
the
whole
of
them
walked
on
with
more
silence
than
usually
characterised
them
charles
holland's
pursuit
of
the
vampyre--the
dangerous
interview
illustration
it
will
be
recollected
that
the
admiral
had
made
a
remark
about
charles
holland
having
suddenly
disappeared
and
it
is
for
us
now
to
account
for
that
disappearance
and
to
follow
him
to
the
pathway
he
had
chosen
the
fact
was
that
he
when
varney
fired
the
shot
at
the
doctor
or
what
was
the
supposed
shot
was
the
farthest
from
the
vampyre
and
he
on
that
very
account
had
the
clearest
and
best
opportunity
of
marking
which
route
he
took
when
he
had
discharged
the
pistol
he
was
not
confused
by
the
smoke
as
the
others
were
nor
was
he
stunned
by
the
noise
of
the
discharge
but
he
distinctly
saw
varney
dart
across
one
of
the
garden
beds
and
make
for
the
summer-house
instead
of
for
the
garden
gate
as
henry
had
supposed
was
the
most
probable
path
he
had
chosen
now
charles
holland
either
had
an
inclination
for
some
reasons
of
his
own
to
follow
the
vampyre
alone
or
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
had
not
time
to
give
an
alarm
to
the
others
but
certain
it
is
that
he
did
unaided
rush
after
him
he
saw
him
enter
the
summer-house
and
pass
out
of
it
again
at
the
back
portion
of
it
as
he
had
once
before
done
when
surprised
in
his
interview
with
flora
but
the
vampyre
did
not
now
as
he
had
done
on
the
former
occasion
hide
immediately
behind
the
summer-house
he
seemed
to
be
well
aware
that
that
expedient
would
not
answer
twice
so
he
at
once
sped
onwards
clearing
the
garden
fence
and
taking
to
the
meadows
it
formed
evidently
no
part
of
the
intentions
of
charles
holland
to
come
up
with
him
he
was
resolved
upon
dogging
his
footsteps
to
know
where
he
should
go
so
that
he
might
have
a
knowledge
of
his
hiding-place
if
he
had
one
i
must
and
will
said
charles
to
himself
penetrate
the
mystery
that
hangs
about
this
most
strange
and
inexplicable
being
i
will
have
an
interview
with
him
not
in
hostility
for
i
forgive
him
the
evil
he
has
done
me
but
with
a
kindly
spirit
and
i
will
ask
him
to
confide
in
me
charles
therefore
did
not
keep
so
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
vampyre
as
to
excite
any
suspicions
of
his
intention
to
follow
him
but
he
waited
by
the
garden
paling
long
enough
not
only
for
varney
to
get
some
distance
off
but
long
enough
likewise
to
know
that
the
pistol
which
had
been
fired
at
the
doctor
had
produced
no
real
bad
effects
except
singing
some
curious
tufts
of
hair
upon
the
sides
of
his
face
which
the
doctor
was
pleased
to
call
whiskers
i
thought
as
much
was
charles's
exclamation
when
he
heard
the
doctor's
voice
it
would
have
been
strikingly
at
variance
with
all
varney's
other
conduct
if
he
had
committed
such
a
deliberate
and
heartless
murder
then
as
the
form
of
the
vampyre
could
be
but
dimly
seen
charles
ran
on
for
some
distance
in
the
direction
he
had
taken
and
then
paused
again
so
that
if
varney
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
paused
to
listen
they
had
ceased
again
probably
and
nothing
was
discernible
in
this
manner
he
followed
the
mysterious
individual
if
we
may
really
call
him
such
for
above
a
mile
and
then
varney
made
a
rapid
detour
and
took
his
way
towards
the
town
he
went
onwards
with
wonderful
precision
now
in
a
right
line
not
stopping
at
any
obstruction
in
the
way
of
fences
hedges
or
ditches
so
that
it
took
charles
some
exertion
to
which
just
then
he
was
scarcely
equal
to
keep
up
with
him
at
length
the
outskirts
of
the
town
were
gained
and
then
varney
paused
and
looked
around
him
scarcely
allowing
charles
who
was
now
closer
to
him
than
he
had
been
time
to
hide
himself
from
observation
which
however
he
did
accomplish
by
casting
himself
suddenly
upon
the
ground
so
that
he
could
not
be
detected
against
the
sky
which
then
formed
a
back
ground
to
the
spot
where
he
was
apparently
satisfied
that
he
had
completely
now
eluded
the
pursuit
if
any
had
been
attempted
of
those
whom
he
had
led
in
such
a
state
of
confusion
the
vampyre
walked
hastily
towards
a
house
that
was
to
let
and
which
was
only
to
be
reached
by
going
up
an
avenue
of
trees
and
then
unlocking
a
gate
in
a
wall
which
bounded
the
premises
next
to
the
avenue
but
the
vampyre
appeared
to
be
possessed
of
every
facility
for
effecting
an
entrance
to
the
place
and
producing
from
his
pocket
a
key
he
at
once
opened
the
gate
and
disappeared
within
the
precincts
of
those
premises
he
no
doubt
felt
that
he
was
hunted
by
the
mob
of
the
town
and
hence
his
frequent
change
of
residence
since
his
own
had
been
burnt
down
and
indeed
situated
as
he
was
there
can
be
no
manner
of
doubt
that
he
would
have
been
sacrificed
to
the
superstitious
fury
of
the
populace
if
they
could
but
have
got
hold
of
him
he
had
from
his
knowledge
which
was
no
doubt
accurate
and
complete
of
what
had
been
done
a
good
idea
of
what
his
own
fate
would
be
were
he
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
that
ferocious
multitude
each
individual
composing
which
felt
a
conviction
that
there
would
be
no
peace
nor
hope
of
prosperity
or
happiness
on
the
place
until
he
the
arch
vampyre
of
all
the
supposed
vampyres
was
destroyed
illustration
charles
did
pause
for
a
few
moments
after
having
thus
become
roused
to
consider
whether
he
should
then
attempt
to
have
the
interview
he
had
resolved
upon
having
by
some
means
or
another
or
defer
it
now
that
he
knew
where
varney
was
to
be
found
until
another
time
but
when
he
came
to
consider
how
extremely
likely
it
was
that
even
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
varney
might
shift
his
abode
for
some
good
and
substantial
reasons
he
at
once
determined
upon
attempting
to
see
him
but
how
to
accomplish
such
a
purpose
was
not
the
easiest
question
in
the
world
to
answer
if
he
rung
the
bell
that
presented
itself
above
the
garden
gate
was
it
at
all
likely
that
varney
who
had
come
there
for
concealment
would
pay
any
attention
to
the
summons
after
some
consideration
he
did
however
think
of
a
plan
by
which
at
all
events
he
could
ensure
effecting
an
entrance
into
the
premises
and
then
he
would
take
his
chance
of
finding
the
mysterious
being
whom
he
sought
and
who
probably
might
have
no
particular
objection
to
meeting
with
him
charles
holland
because
their
last
interview
in
the
ruins
could
not
be
said
to
be
otherwise
than
of
a
peaceable
and
calm
enough
character
he
saw
by
the
board
which
was
nailed
in
the
front
of
the
house
that
all
applications
to
see
it
were
to
be
made
to
a
mr
nash
residing
close
at
hand
and
as
charles
had
the
appearance
of
a
respectable
person
he
thought
he
might
possibly
have
the
key
entrusted
to
him
ostensibly
to
look
at
the
house
preparatory
possibly
to
taking
it
and
so
he
should
at
all
events
obtain
admission
he
accordingly
went
at
once
to
this
mr
nash
and
asked
about
the
house
of
course
he
had
to
affect
an
interest
in
its
rental
and
accommodations
which
he
did
not
feel
in
order
to
lull
any
suspicion
and
finally
he
said--
i
should
like
to
look
over
it
if
you
will
lend
me
the
key
which
i
will
shortly
bring
back
to
you
there
was
an
evident
hesitation
about
the
agent
when
this
proposal
was
communicated
by
charles
holland
and
he
said--
i
dare
say
sir
you
wonder
that
i
don't
say
yes
at
once
but
the
fact
is
there
came
a
gentleman
here
one
day
when
i
was
out
and
got
a
key
for
we
have
two
to
open
the
house
from
my
wife
and
he
never
came
back
again
that
this
was
the
means
by
which
varney
the
vampyre
had
obtained
the
key
by
the
aid
of
which
charles
had
seen
him
effect
so
immediate
an
entrance
to
the
house
there
could
be
no
doubt
how
long
ago
were
you
served
that
trick
he
said
about
two
days
ago
sir
well
it
only
shows
how
when
one
person
acts
wrongly
another
is
at
once
suspected
of
a
capability
to
do
so
likewise
there
is
my
name
and
my
address
i
should
like
rather
to
go
alone
to
see
the
house
because
i
always
fancy
i
can
judge
better
by
myself
of
the
accommodation
and
i
can
stay
as
long
as
i
like
and
ascertain
the
sizes
of
all
the
rooms
without
the
disagreeable
feeling
upon
my
mind
which
no
amount
of
complaisance
on
your
part
could
ever
get
me
over
that
i
was
most
unaccountably
detaining
somebody
from
more
important
business
of
their
own
oh
i
assure
you
sir
said
mr
nash
that
i
should
not
be
at
all
impatient
but
if
you
would
rather
go
alone--
indeed
i
would
oh
then
sir
there
is
the
key
a
gentleman
who
leaves
his
name
and
address
of
course
we
can
have
no
objection
to
i
only
told
you
of
what
happened
sir
in
the
mere
way
of
conversation
and
i
hope
you
won't
imagine
for
a
moment
that
i
meant
to
insinuate
that
you
were
going
to
keep
the
key
oh
certainly
not--certainly
not
said
charles
who
was
only
too
glad
to
get
the
key
upon
any
terms
you
are
quite
right
and
i
beg
you
will
say
no
more
about
it
i
quite
understand
he
then
walked
off
to
the
empty
house
again
and
proceeding
to
the
avenue
he
fitted
the
key
to
the
lock
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
finding
the
gate
instantly
yield
to
him
when
he
passed
through
it
and
closed
the
door
after
him
which
he
did
carefully
he
found
himself
in
a
handsomely
laid-out
garden
and
saw
the
house
a
short
distance
in
front
of
him
standing
upon
a
well
got-up
lawn
he
cared
not
if
varney
should
see
him
before
he
reached
the
house
because
the
fact
was
sufficiently
evident
to
himself
that
after
all
he
could
not
actually
enforce
an
interview
with
the
vampyre
he
only
hoped
that
as
he
had
found
him
out
it
would
be
conceded
to
him
he
therefore
walked
up
the
lawn
without
making
the
least
attempt
at
concealment
and
when
he
reached
the
house
he
allowed
his
footsteps
to
make
what
noise
they
would
upon
the
stone
steps
which
led
up
to
it
but
no
one
appeared
nor
was
there
either
by
sight
or
by
sound
any
indication
of
the
presence
of
any
living
being
in
the
place
besides
himself
insensibly
as
he
contemplated
the
deserted
place
around
him
the
solemn
sort
of
stillness
began
to
have
its
effect
upon
his
imagination
and
without
being
aware
that
he
did
so
he
had
with
softness
and
caution
glided
onwards
as
if
he
were
bent
on
some
errand
requiring
the
utmost
amount
of
caution
and
discrimination
in
the
conduction
of
it
and
so
he
entered
the
hall
of
the
house
where
he
stood
some
time
and
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
without
however
being
able
to
hear
the
least
sound
throughout
the
whole
of
the
house
and
yet
he
must
be
here
thought
charles
to
himself
i
was
not
gone
many
minutes
and
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
he
has
left
after
taking
so
much
trouble
by
making
such
a
detour
around
the
meadows
to
get
here
without
being
observed
i
will
examine
every
room
in
the
place
but
i
will
find
him
charles
immediately
commenced
going
from
room
to
room
of
that
house
in
his
search
for
the
vampyre
there
were
but
four
apartments
upon
the
ground
floor
and
these
of
course
he
quickly
ran
through
nothing
whatever
at
all
indicative
of
any
one
having
been
there
met
his
gaze
and
with
a
feeling
of
disappointment
creeping
over
him
he
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
staircase
the
day
had
now
fairly
commenced
so
that
there
was
abundance
of
light
although
even
for
the
country
it
was
an
early
hour
and
probably
mr
nash
had
been
not
a
little
surprised
to
have
a
call
from
one
whose
appearance
bespoke
no
necessity
for
rising
with
the
lark
at
such
an
hour
all
these
considerations
however
sank
into
insignificance
in
charles's
mind
compared
with
the
object
he
had
in
view
namely
the
unravelling
the
many
mysteries
that
hung
around
that
man
he
ascended
to
the
landing
of
the
first
story
and
then
as
he
could
have
no
choice
he
opened
the
first
door
that
his
eyes
fell
upon
and
entered
a
tolerably
large
apartment
it
was
quite
destitute
of
furniture
and
at
the
moment
charles
was
about
to
pronounce
it
empty
but
then
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
large
black-looking
bundle
of
something
that
seemed
to
be
lying
jammed
up
under
the
window
on
the
floor--that
being
the
place
of
all
others
in
the
room
which
was
enveloped
in
the
most
shadow
he
started
back
involuntarily
at
the
moment
for
the
appearance
was
one
so
shapeless
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
defining
from
even
that
distance
what
it
really
was
then
he
slowly
and
cautiously
approached
it
as
we
always
approach
that
of
the
character
of
which
we
are
ignorant
and
concerning
the
powers
of
which
to
do
injury
we
can
consequently
have
no
defined
idea
that
it
was
a
human
form
there
was
the
first
tangible
opinion
he
had
about
it
and
from
its
profound
stillness
and
the
manner
in
which
it
seemed
to
be
laid
close
under
the
window
he
thought
that
he
was
surely
upon
the
point
of
finding
out
that
some
deed
of
blood
had
been
committed
the
unfortunate
victim
of
which
was
now
lying
before
him
upon
a
nearer
examination
he
found
that
the
whole
body
including
the
greater
part
of
the
head
and
face
was
wrapped
in
a
large
cloak
and
there
as
he
gazed
he
soon
found
cause
to
correct
his
first
opinion
at
to
the
form
belonging
to
the
dead
for
he
could
distinctly
hear
the
regular
breathing
as
of
some
one
in
a
sound
and
dreamless
sleep
closer
he
went
and
closer
still
then
as
he
clasped
his
hands
he
said
in
a
voice
scarcely
above
a
whisper--
it
is--it
is
the
vampyre
yes
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
fact
it
was
sir
francis
varney
who
lay
there
enveloped
in
the
huge
horseman's
cloak
in
which
on
two
or
three
occasions
during
the
progress
of
this
narrative
he
had
figured
there
he
lay
at
the
mercy
completely
of
any
arm
that
might
be
raised
against
him
apparently
so
overcome
by
fatigue
that
no
ordinary
noise
would
have
awakened
him
well
might
charles
holland
gaze
at
him
with
mingled
feelings
there
lay
the
being
who
had
done
almost
enough
to
drive
the
beautiful
flora
bannerworth
distracted--the
being
who
had
compelled
the
bannerworth
family
to
leave
their
ancient
house
to
which
they
had
been
bound
by
every
description
of
association
the
same
mysterious
existence
too
who
the
better
to
carry
on
his
plots
and
plans
had
by
dint
of
violence
immured
him
charles
in
a
dungeon
and
loaded
him
with
chains
there
he
lay
sleeping
and
at
his
mercy
shall
i
awaken
him
said
charles
or
let
him
sleep
off
the
fatigue
which
no
doubt
is
weighing
down
his
limbs
and
setting
heavily
on
his
eyelids
no
my
business
with
him
is
too
urgent
he
then
raised
his
voice
and
cried--
varney
varney
awake
the
sound
disturbed
without
altogether
breaking
up
the
deep
slumber
of
the
vampyre
and
he
uttered
a
low
moan
and
moved
one
hand
restlessly
then
as
if
that
disturbance
of
the
calm
and
deep
repose
which
had
sat
upon
him
had
given
at
once
the
reins
to
fancy
he
begin
to
mutter
strange
words
in
his
sleep
some
of
which
could
be
heard
by
charles
distinctly
while
others
were
too
incoherently
uttered
to
be
clearly
understood
where
is
it
he
said
where--where
hidden--pull
the
house
down--murder
no
no
no
no
murder--i
will
not
i
dare
not
blood
enough
is
upon
my
hands--the
money--the
money
down
villains
down
down
down
what
these
incoherent
words
alluded
to
specifically
charles
of
course
could
not
have
the
least
idea
but
he
listened
attentively
with
a
hope
that
something
might
fall
from
his
lips
that
would
afford
a
key
to
some
of
the
mysterious
circumstances
with
which
he
was
so
intimately
connected
now
however
there
was
a
longer
silence
than
before
only
broken
occasionally
by
low
moans
but
suddenly
as
charles
was
thinking
of
again
speaking
he
uttered
some
more
disjointed
sentences
no
harm
he
said
no
harm--marchdale
is
a
villain--not
a
hair
of
his
head
injured--no
no
set
him
free--yes
i
will
set
him
free
beware
beware
marchdale
and
you
mortimer
the
scaffold
ay
the
scaffold
but
where
is
the
bright
gold
the
memory
of
the
deed
of
blood
will
not
cling
to
it
where
is
it
hidden
the
gold
the
gold
the
gold
it
is
not
in
the
grave--it
cannot
be
there--no
no
no--not
there
not
there
load
the
pistols
there
there
down
villain
down--down
down
despairing
now
of
obtaining
anything
like
tangible
information
from
these
ravings
which
even
if
they
did
by
accident
so
connect
themselves
together
as
to
seem
to
mean
something
charles
again
cried
aloud--
varney
awake
awake
but
as
before
the
sleeping
man
was
sufficiently
deaf
to
the
cry
to
remain
with
his
eyes
closed
still
in
a
disturbed
slumber
but
yet
a
slumber
which
might
last
for
a
considerable
time
i
have
heard
said
charles
that
there
are
many
persons
whom
no
noise
will
awaken
while
the
slightest
touch
rouses
them
in
an
instant
i
will
try
that
upon
this
slumbering
being
as
he
spoke
he
advanced
close
to
sir
francis
varney
and
touched
him
slightly
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
the
effect
was
as
startling
as
it
was
instantaneous
the
vampyre
sprang
to
his
feet
as
he
had
been
suddenly
impelled
up
by
some
powerful
machinery
and
casting
his
cloak
away
from
his
arms
so
as
to
have
them
at
liberty
he
sprang
upon
charles
holland
and
hurled
him
to
the
ground
where
he
held
him
with
a
giant's
gripe
as
he
cried--
rash
fool
be
you
whom
you
may
why
have
you
troubled
me
to
rid
the
world
of
your
intrusive
existence
the
attack
was
so
sudden
and
so
terrific
that
resistance
to
it
even
if
charles
had
had
the
power
was
out
of
the
question
all
he
could
say
was--
varney
varney
do
you
not
know
me
i
am
charles
holland
will
you
now
in
your
mad
rage
take
the
life
you
might
more
easily
have
taken
when
i
lay
in
the
dungeon
from
which
you
released
me
the
sound
of
his
voice
at
once
convinced
sir
francis
varney
of
his
identity
and
it
was
with
a
voice
that
had
some
tones
of
regret
in
it
that
he
replied--
and
wherefore
have
you
thought
proper
when
you
were
once
free
and
unscathed
to
cast
yourself
into
such
a
position
of
danger
as
to
follow
me
to
my
haunt
i
contemplated
no
danger
said
charles
because
i
contemplated
no
evil
i
do
not
know
why
you
should
kill
me
you
came
here
and
yet
you
say
you
do
not
know
why
i
should
kill
you
young
man
have
you
a
dozen
lives
that
you
can
afford
to
tamper
with
them
thus
i
have
at
much
chance
of
imminence
to
myself
already
once
saved
you
when
another
with
a
sterner
feeling
would
have
gladly
taken
your
life
but
now
as
if
you
were
determined
to
goad
me
to
an
act
which
i
have
shunned
committing
you
will
not
let
me
close
my
eyes
in
peace
take
your
hand
from
off
my
throat
varney
and
i
will
then
tell
you
what
brought
me
here
sir
francis
varney
did
so
rise
he
said--rise
i
have
seen
blood
enough
to
be
sickened
at
the
prospect
of
more
but
you
should
not
have
come
here
and
tempted
me
nay
believe
me
i
came
here
for
good
and
not
for
evil
sir
francis
varney
hear
me
out
and
then
judge
for
yourself
whether
you
can
blame
the
perseverance
which
enabled
me
to
find
out
this
secret
place
of
refuge
but
let
me
first
say
that
now
it
is
as
good
a
place
of
concealment
to
you
as
before
it
was
for
i
shall
not
betray
you
go
on
go
on
what
is
it
you
desire
during
the
long
and
weary
hours
of
my
captivity
i
thought
deeply
and
painfully
too
as
may
be
well
imagined
of
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
your
appearance
at
bannerworth
hall
and
your
subsequent
conduct
then
i
felt
convinced
that
there
was
something
far
more
than
met
the
eye
in
the
whole
affair
and
from
what
i
have
been
informed
of
since
i
am
the
more
convinced
that
some
secret
some
mystery
which
it
is
in
your
power
only
perhaps
to
explain
lurks
at
the
bottom
of
all
your
conduct
well
proceed
said
varney
have
i
not
said
enough
now
to
enable
you
to
divine
the
object
of
my
visit
it
is
that
you
should
shake
off
the
trammels
of
mystery
in
which
you
have
shrouded
yourself
and
declare
what
it
is
you
want
what
it
is
you
desire
that
has
induced
you
to
set
yourself
up
as
such
a
determined
foe
of
the
bannerworth
family
and
that
you
say
is
the
modest
request
that
brings
you
here
you
speak
as
if
you
thought
it
was
idle
curiosity
that
prompts
me
but
you
know
it
is
not
your
language
and
manner
are
those
of
a
man
of
too
much
sagacity
not
to
see
that
i
have
higher
notions
name
them
you
have
yourself
in
more
than
one
instance
behaved
with
a
strange
sort
of
romantic
generosity
as
if
but
for
some
great
object
which
you
felt
impelled
to
seek
by
any
means
and
at
any
sacrifice
you
would
be
a
something
in
character
and
conduct
very
different
from
what
you
are
one
of
my
objects
then
is
to
awaken
that
better
nature
which
is
slumbering
within
you
only
now
and
then
rousing
itself
to
do
some
deed
which
should
be
the
character
of
all
your
actions--for
your
own
sake
i
have
come
but
not
wholly
not
wholly
as
you
say
there
is
another
than
whom
the
whole
world
is
not
so
dear
to
me
that
other
one
was
serene
as
she
was
beautiful
happiness
danced
in
her
eyes
and
she
ought--for
not
more
lovely
is
the
mind
that
she
possesses
than
the
glorious
form
that
enshrines
it--to
be
happy
her
life
should
have
passed
like
one
long
summer's
day
of
beauty
sunshine
and
pure
heavenly
enjoyment
you
have
poisoned
the
cup
of
joy
that
the
great
god
of
nature
had
permitted
her
to
place
to
her
lips
and
taste
of
mistrustingly
why
have
you
done
this
i
ask
you--why
have
you
done
this
have
you
said
all
that
you
came
to
say
i
have
spoken
the
substance
of
my
message
much
could
i
elaborate
upon
such
a
theme
but
it
is
not
one
varney
which
is
congenial
to
my
heart
for
your
sake
however
and
for
the
sakes
of
those
whom
i
hold
most
dear
let
me
implore
you
to
act
in
this
matter
with
a
kindly
consideration
proclaim
your
motives
you
cannot
say
that
they
are
not
such
as
we
may
aid
you
in
varney
was
silent
for
several
moments
he
seemed
perceptibly
moved
by
the
manner
of
the
young
man
as
well
as
by
the
matter
of
his
discourse
in
fact
one
would
suppose
that
charles
holland
had
succeeded
in
investing
what
he
said
with
some
sort
of
charm
that
won
much
upon
the
fancy
of
sir
francis
varney
for
when
he
ceased
to
speak
the
latter
said
in
a
low
voice--
go
on
go
on
you
have
surely
much
more
to
say
no
varney
i
have
said
enough
and
not
thus
much
would
i
have
said
had
i
not
been
aware
most
certainly
and
truly
aware
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
by
your
manner
that
you
were
most
accessible
to
human
feeling
i
accessible
to
human
feeling
know
you
to
whom
you
speak
am
i
not
he
before
whom
all
men
shudder
whose
name
has
been
a
terror
and
a
desolation
and
yet
you
can
talk
of
my
human
feelings
nay
if
i
had
had
any
be
sure
they
would
have
been
extinguished
by
the
persecutions
i
have
endured
from
those
who
you
know
with
savage
ferocity
have
sought
my
life
no
varney
i
give
you
credit
for
being
a
subtler
reasoner
than
thus
to
argue
you
know
well
that
you
were
the
aggressor
to
those
parties
who
sought
your
life
you
know
well
that
with
the
greatest
imaginable
pains
you
held
yourself
up
to
them
as
a
thing
of
great
terror
i
did--i
did
you
cannot
then
turn
round
upon
ignorant
persons
and
blame
them
because
your
exertions
to
make
yourself
seem
what
you
wish
were
but
too
successful
you
use
the
word
seem
said
varney
with
a
bitterness
of
aspect
as
if
you
would
imply
a
doubt
that
i
am
that
which
thousands
by
their
fears
would
testify
me
to
be
thousands
might
said
charles
holland
but
not
among
them
am
i
varney
i
will
not
be
made
the
victim
of
superstition
were
you
to
enact
before
my
very
eyes
some
of
those
feats
which
to
the
senses
of
others
would
stamp
you
as
the
preternatural
being
you
assume
to
be
i
would
doubt
the
evidence
of
my
own
senses
ere
i
permitted
such
a
bugbear
to
oppress
my
brain
go
said
sir
francis
varney
go
i
have
no
more
words
for
you
i
have
nothing
to
relate
to
you
nay
you
have
already
listened
sufficiently
to
me
to
give
me
a
hope
that
i
had
awakened
some
of
the
humanity
that
was
in
your
nature
do
not
sir
francis
varney
crush
that
hope
even
as
it
was
budding
forth
not
for
my
own
sake
do
i
ask
you
for
revelations
that
may
perhaps--must
be
painful
for
you
but
for
the
sake
of
flora
bannerworth
to
whom
you
owe
abundance
of
reparation
no
no
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
great
and
good
and
just
i
call
upon
you
for
justice
what
have
i
to
do
with
such
an
invocation
utter
such
a
sentiment
to
men
who
like
yourself
are
invested
with
the
reality
as
well
as
the
outward
show
of
human
nature
nay
sir
francis
varney
now
you
belie
yourself
you
have
passed
through
a
long
and
perchance
a
stormy
life
can
you
look
back
upon
your
career
and
find
no
reminiscences
of
the
past
that
shall
convince
you
that
you
are
of
the
great
family
of
man
and
have
had
abundance
of
human
feelings
and
of
human
affections
peace
peace
nay
sir
francis
varney
i
will
take
your
word
and
if
you
will
lay
your
hand
upon
your
heart
and
tell
me
truly
that
you
never
felt
what
it
was
to
love--to
have
all
feeling
all
taste
and
all
hope
of
future
joy
concentrated
in
one
individual
i
will
despair
and
leave
you
if
you
will
tell
me
that
never
in
your
whole
life
you
have
felt
for
any
fair
and
glorious
creature
as
i
now
feel
for
flora
bannerworth
a
being
for
whom
you
could
have
sacrificed
not
only
existence
but
all
the
hopes
of
a
glorious
future
that
bloom
around
it--if
you
will
tell
me
with
the
calm
dispassionate
aspect
of
truth
that
you
have
held
yourself
aloof
from
such
human
feelings
i
will
no
longer
press
you
to
a
disclosure
which
i
shall
bring
no
argument
to
urge
the
agitation
of
sir
francis
varney's
countenance
was
perceptible
and
charles
holland
was
about
to
speak
again
when
striking
him
upon
the
breast
with
his
clinched
hand
the
vampyre
checked
him
saying--
do
you
wish
to
drive
me
mad
that
you
thus
from
memory's
hidden
cells
conjure
up
images
of
the
past
then
there
are
such
images
to
conjure
up--there
are
such
shadows
only
sleeping
but
which
require
only
as
you
did
even
now
but
a
touch
to
awaken
them
to
life
and
energy
oh
sir
francis
varney
do
not
tell
me
that
you
are
not
human
the
vampyre
made
a
furious
gesture
as
if
he
would
have
attacked
charles
holland
but
then
he
sank
nearly
to
the
floor
as
if
soul-stricken
by
some
recollection
that
unnerved
his
arm
he
shook
with
unwonted
emotion
and
from
the
frightful
livid
aspect
of
his
countenance
charles
dreaded
some
serious
accession
of
indisposition
which
might
if
nothing
else
did
prevent
him
from
making
the
revelation
he
so
much
sought
to
hear
from
his
lips
varney
he
cried
varney
be
calm
you
will
be
listened
to
by
one
who
will
draw
no
harsh--no
hasty
conclusions
by
one
who
with
that
charity
i
grieve
to
say
is
rare
will
place
upon
the
words
you
utter
the
most
favourable
construction
tell
me
all
i
pray
you
tell
me
all
this
is
strange
said
the
vampyre
i
never
thought
that
aught
human
could
thus
have
moved
me
young
man
you
have
touched
the
chords
of
memory
they
vibrate
throughout
my
heart
producing
cadences
and
sounds
of
years
long
past
bear
with
me
awhile
and
you
will
speak
to
me
i
will
having
your
promise
then
i
am
content
varney
but
you
must
be
secret
not
even
in
the
wildest
waste
of
nature
where
you
can
well
presume
that
naught
but
heaven
can
listen
to
your
whisperings
must
you
utter
one
word
of
that
which
i
shall
tell
to
you
alas
said
charles
i
dare
not
take
such
a
confidence
i
have
said
that
it
is
not
for
myself
i
seek
such
knowledge
of
what
you
are
and
what
you
have
been
but
it
is
for
another
so
dear
to
me
that
all
the
charms
of
life
that
make
up
other
men's
delights
equal
not
the
witchery
of
one
glance
from
her
speaking
as
it
does
of
the
glorious
light
from
that
heaven
which
is
eternal
from
whence
she
sprung
and
you
reject
my
communication
said
varney
because
i
will
not
give
you
leave
to
expose
it
to
flora
bannerworth
it
must
be
so
and
you
are
most
anxious
to
hear
that
which
i
have
to
relate
most
anxious
indeed--indeed
most
anxious
then
have
i
found
in
that
scruple
which
besets
your
mind
a
better
argument
for
trusting
you
than
had
ye
been
loud
in
protestation
had
your
promises
of
secrecy
been
but
those
which
come
from
the
lip
and
not
from
the
heart
my
confidence
would
not
have
been
rejected
on
such
grounds
i
think
that
i
dare
trust
you
with
leave
to
tell
to
flora
that
which
you
shall
communicate
you
may
whisper
it
to
her
but
to
no
one
else
without
my
special
leave
and
licence
i
agree
to
those
terms
and
will
religiously
preserve
them
i
do
not
doubt
you
for
one
moment
and
now
i
will
tell
to
you
what
never
yet
has
passed
my
lips
to
mortal
man
now
will
i
connect
together
some
matters
which
you
may
have
heard
piecemeal
from
others
what
others
are
they
dr
chillingworth
and
he
who
once
officiated
as
a
london
hangman
i
have
heard
something
from
those
quarters
listen
then
to
me
and
you
shall
better
understand
that
which
you
have
heard
some
years
ago
it
matters
not
the
number
on
a
stormy
night
towards
the
autumn
of
the
year
two
men
sat
alone
in
poverty
and
that
species
of
distress
which
beset
the
haughty
profligate
daring
man
who
has
been
accustomed
all
his
life
to
its
most
enticing
enjoyments
but
never
to
that
industry
which
alone
ought
to
produce
them
and
render
them
great
and
magnificent
two
men
and
who
were
they
i
was
one
look
upon
me
i
was
of
those
men
and
strong
and
evil
passions
were
battling
in
my
heart
and
the
other
was
marmaduke
bannerworth
gracious
heaven
the
father
of
her
whom
i
adore
the
suicide
yes
the
same
that
man
stained
with
a
thousand
vices--blasted
by
a
thousand
crimes--the
father
of
her
who
partakes
nothing
of
his
nature
who
borrows
nothing
from
his
memory
but
his
name--was
the
man
who
there
sat
with
me
plotting
and
contriving
how
by
fraud
or
violence
we
were
to
lead
our
usual
life
of
revelry
and
wild
audacious
debauch
go
on
go
on
believe
me
i
am
deeply
interested
i
can
see
as
much
we
were
not
nice
in
the
various
schemes
which
our
prolific
fancies
engendered
if
trickery
and
the
false
dice
at
the
gaming-table
sufficed
not
to
fill
our
purses
we
were
bold
enough
for
violence
if
simple
robbery
would
not
succeed
we
could
take
a
life
murder
ay
call
it
by
its
proper
name
a
murder
we
sat
till
the
midnight
hour
had
passed
without
arriving
at
a
definite
conclusion
we
saw
no
plan
of
practicable
operation
and
so
we
wandered
onwards
to
one
of
those
deep
dens
of
iniquity
a
gaming-house
wherein
we
had
won
and
lost
thousands
we
had
no
money
but
we
staked
largely
in
the
shape
of
a
wager
upon
the
success
of
one
of
the
players
we
knew
not
or
cared
not
for
the
consequence
if
we
had
lost
but
as
it
happened
we
were
largely
successful
and
beggars
as
we
had
walked
into
that
place
we
might
have
left
it
independent
men
but
when
does
the
gambler
know
when
to
pause
in
his
career
if
defeat
awakens
all
the
raging
passions
of
humanity
within
his
bosom
success
but
feeds
the
great
vice
that
has
been
there
engendered
to
the
dawn
of
morn
we
played
the
bright
sun
shone
in
and
yet
we
played--the
midday
came
and
went--the
stimulant
of
wine
supported
us
and
still
we
played
then
came
the
shadows
of
evening
stealing
on
in
all
their
beauty
but
what
were
they
to
us
amid
those
mutations
of
fortune
which
at
one
moment
made
us
princes
and
placed
palaces
at
our
control
and
at
another
debased
us
below
the
veriest
beggar
that
craves
the
stinted
alms
of
charity
from
door
to
door
and
there
was
one
man
who
from
the
first
to
the
last
stayed
by
us
like
a
very
fiend
more
than
man
i
thought
he
was
not
human
we
won
of
all
but
of
him
people
came
and
brought
their
bright
red
gold
and
laid
it
down
before
us
but
for
us
to
take
it
up
and
then
by
a
cruel
stroke
of
fortune
he
took
it
from
us
the
night
came
on
we
won
and
he
won
of
us
the
clock
struck
twelve--we
were
beggars
god
knows
what
was
he
we
saw
him
place
his
winnings
about
his
person--we
saw
the
smile
that
curved
the
corners
of
his
lips
he
was
calm
and
we
were
maddened
the
blood
flowed
temperately
through
his
veins
but
in
ours
it
was
burning
lava
scorching
as
it
went
through
every
petty
artery
and
drying
up
all
human
thought--all
human
feeling
the
winner
left
and
we
tracked
his
footsteps
when
he
reached
the
open
air
although
he
had
taken
much
less
than
we
of
the
intoxicating
beverages
that
are
supplied
gratis
to
those
who
frequent
those
haunts
of
infamy
it
was
evident
that
some
sort
of
inebriation
attacked
him
his
steps
were
disordered
and
unsteady
and
as
we
followed
him
we
could
perceive
by
the
devious
track
that
he
took
that
he
was
somewhat
uncertain
of
his
route
we
had
no
fixed
motive
in
so
pursuing
this
man
it
was
but
an
impulsive
proceeding
at
the
best
but
as
he
still
went
on
and
cleared
the
streets
getting
into
the
wild
and
open
country
and
among
the
hedge-rows
we
began
to
whisper
together
and
to
think
that
what
we
did
not
owe
to
fortune
we
might
to
our
own
energy
and
courage
at
such
a
moment
i
need
not
hesitate
to
say
so
since
to
hide
the
most
important
feature
of
my
revelation
from
you
would
be
but
to
mock
you
we
resolved
upon
robbing
him
and
was
that
all
it
was
all
that
our
resolution
went
to
we
were
not
anxious
to
spill
blood
but
still
we
were
resolved
that
we
would
accomplish
our
purpose
even
if
it
required
murder
for
its
consummation
have
you
heard
enough
i
have
not
heard
enough
although
i
guess
the
rest
you
may
well
guess
it
from
its
preface
he
turned
down
a
lonely
pathway
which
had
we
chosen
it
ourselves
could
not
have
been
more
suitable
for
the
attack
we
meditated
there
were
tall
trees
on
either
side
and
a
hedge-row
stretching
high
up
between
them
we
knew
that
that
lane
led
to
a
suburban
village
which
without
a
doubt
was
the
object
of
his
destination
then
marmaduke
bannerworth
spoke
saying--
'what
we
have
to
do
must
be
done
now
or
never
there
needs
not
two
in
this
adventure
shall
you
or
i
require
him
to
refund
what
he
has
won
from
us'
'i
care
not'
i
said
'but
if
we
are
to
accomplish
our
purpose
without
arousing
even
a
shadow
of
resistance
it
is
better
to
show
him
its
futility
by
both
appearing
and
take
a
share
in
the
adventure'
this
was
agreed
upon
and
we
hastened
forward
he
heard
footsteps
pursuing
him
and
quickened
his
pace
i
was
the
fleetest
runner
and
overtook
him
i
passed
him
a
pace
or
two
and
then
turning
i
faced
him
and
impeded
his
progress
the
lane
was
narrow
and
a
glance
behind
him
showed
him
marmaduke
bannerworth
so
that
he
was
hemmed
in
between
two
enemies
and
could
move
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
on
account
of
the
thick
brushwood
that
intervened
between
the
trees
then
with
an
assumed
courage
that
sat
but
ill
upon
him
he
demanded
of
us
what
we
wanted
and
proclaimed
his
right
to
pass
despite
the
obstruction
we
placed
in
his
way
the
dialogue
was
brief
i
being
foremost
spoke
to
him
'your
money'
i
said
'your
winnings
at
the
gaming-table
we
cannot
and
we
will
not
lose
it'
so
suddenly
that
he
had
nearly
taken
my
life
he
drew
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
and
levelling
it
at
my
head
he
fired
upon
me
perhaps
had
i
moved
it
might
have
been
my
death
but
as
it
was
the
bullet
furrowed
my
cheek
leaving
a
scar
the
path
of
which
is
yet
visible
in
a
white
cicatrix
i
felt
a
stunning
sensation
and
thought
myself
a
dead
man
i
cried
aloud
to
marmaduke
bannerworth
and
he
rushed
forward
i
knew
not
that
he
was
armed
and
that
he
had
the
power
about
him
to
do
the
deed
which
he
then
accomplished
but
there
was
a
groan
a
slight
struggle
and
the
successful
gamester
fell
upon
the
green
sward
bathed
in
his
blood
and
this
is
the
father
of
her
whom
i
adore
it
is
are
you
shocked
to
think
of
such
a
neat
relationship
between
so
much
beauty
and
intelligence
and
a
midnight
murderer
is
your
philosophy
so
poor
that
the
daughter's
beauty
suffers
from
the
commission
of
a
father's
crime
no
no
it
is
not
so
do
not
fancy
that
for
one
moment
i
can
entertain
such
unworthy
opinions
the
thought
that
crossed
me
was
that
i
should
have
to
tell
one
of
such
a
gentle
nature
that
her
father
had
done
such
a
deed
on
that
head
you
can
use
your
own
discretion
the
deed
was
done
there
was
sufficient
light
for
us
to
look
upon
the
features
of
the
dying
man
ghastly
and
terrific
they
glared
upon
us
while
the
glazed
eyes
as
they
were
upturned
to
the
bright
sky
seemed
appealing
to
heaven
for
vengeance
against
us
for
having
done
the
deed
many
a
day
and
many
an
hour
since
at
all
times
and
all
seasons
i
have
seen
those
eyes
with
the
glaze
of
death
upon
them
following
me
and
gloating
over
the
misery
they
had
the
power
to
make
i
think
i
see
them
now
indeed
yes
look--look--see
how
they
glare
upon
me--with
what
a
fixed
and
frightful
stare
the
bloodshot
pupils
keep
their
place--there
there
oh
save
me
from
such
a
visitation
again
it
is
too
horrible
i
dare
not--i
cannot
endure
it
and
yet
why
do
you
gaze
at
me
with
such
an
aspect
dread
visitant
you
know
that
it
was
not
my
hand
that
did
the
deed--who
laid
you
low
you
know
that
not
to
me
are
you
able
to
lay
the
heavy
charge
of
your
death
varney
you
look
upon
vacancy
said
charles
holland
no
no
vacancy
it
may
be
to
you
but
to
me
'tis
full
of
horrible
shapes
compose
yourself
you
have
taken
me
far
into
your
confidence
already
i
pray
you
now
to
tell
me
all
i
have
in
my
brain
no
room
for
horrible
conjectures
such
as
those
which
might
else
torment
me
varney
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
he
wiped
from
his
brow
the
heavy
drops
of
perspiration
that
had
there
gathered
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
speak
to
me
added
charles
nothing
will
so
much
relieve
you
from
the
terrors
of
this
remembrance
as
making
a
confidence
which
reflection
will
approve
of
and
which
you
will
know
that
you
have
no
reason
to
repent
charles
holland
said
varney
i
have
already
gone
too
far
to
retract--much
too
far
i
know
and
can
well
understand
all
the
danger
of
half
confidence
you
already
know
so
much
that
it
is
fit
you
should
know
more
go
on
then
varney
i
will
listen
to
you
i
know
not
if
at
this
juncture
i
can
command
myself
to
say
more
i
feel
that
what
next
has
to
be
told
will
be
most
horrible
for
me
to
tell--most
sad
for
you
to
hear
told
i
can
well
believe
varney
from
your
manner
of
speech
and
from
the
words
you
use
that
you
have
some
secret
to
relate
beyond
this
simple
fact
of
the
murder
of
this
gamester
by
marmaduke
bannerworth
you
are
right--such
is
the
fact
the
death
of
that
man
could
not
have
moved
me
as
you
now
see
me
moved
there
is
a
secret
connected
with
his
fate
which
i
may
well
hesitate
to
utter--a
secret
even
to
whisper
to
the
winds
of
heaven--i--although
i
did
not
do
the
deed
no
no--i--i
did
not
strike
the
blow--not
i--not
i
illustration
varney
it
is
astonishing
to
me
the
pains
you
take
to
assure
yourself
of
your
innocence
of
this
deed
no
one
accuses
you
but
still
were
it
not
that
i
am
impressed
with
a
strong
conviction
that
you're
speaking
to
me
nothing
but
the
truth
the
very
fact
of
your
extreme
anxiety
to
acquit
yourself
would
engender
suspicion
i
can
understand
that
feeling
charles
holland
i
can
fully
understand
it
i
do
not
blame
you
for
it--it
is
a
most
natural
one
but
when
you
know
all
you
will
feel
with
me
how
necessary
it
must
have
been
to
my
peace
to
seize
upon
every
trivial
circumstance
that
can
help
me
to
a
belief
in
my
own
innocence
it
may
be
so
as
yet
you
well
know
i
speak
in
ignorance
but
what
could
there
have
been
in
the
character
of
that
gambler
that
has
made
you
so
sympathetic
concerning
his
decease
nothing--nothing
whatever
in
his
character
he
was
a
bad
man
not
one
of
those
free
open
spirits
which
are
seduced
into
crime
by
thoughtlessness--not
one
of
those
whom
we
pity
perchance
more
than
we
condemn
but
a
man
without
a
redeeming
trait
in
his
disposition--a
man
so
heaped
up
with
vices
and
iniquities
that
society
gained
much
by
his
decease
and
not
an
individual
could
say
that
he
had
lost
a
friend
and
yet
the
mere
thought
of
the
circumstances
connected
with
his
death
seems
almost
to
drive
you
to
the
verge
of
despair
you
are
right
the
mere
thought
has
that
effect
you
have
aroused
all
my
curiosity
to
know
the
causes
of
such
a
feeling
varney
paced
the
apartment
in
silence
for
many
minutes
he
seemed
to
be
enduring
a
great
mental
struggle
and
at
length
when
he
turned
to
charles
holland
and
spoke
there
were
upon
his
countenance
traces
of
deep
emotion
i
have
said
young
man
that
i
will
take
you
into
my
confidence
i
have
said
that
i
will
clear
up
many
seeming
mysteries
and
that
i
will
enable
you
to
understand
what
was
obscure
in
the
narrative
of
dr
chillingworth
and
of
that
man
who
filled
the
office
of
public
executioner
and
who
has
haunted
me
so
long
it
is
true
then
as
the
doctor
states
that
you
were
executed
in
london
i
was
and
resuscitated
by
the
galvanic
process
put
into
operation
by
dr
chillingworth
as
he
supposed
but
there
are
truths
connected
with
natural
philosophy
which
he
dreamed
not
of
i
bear
a
charmed
life
and
it
was
but
accident
which
produced
a
similar
effect
upon
the
latent
springs
of
my
existence
in
the
house
to
which
the
executioner
conducted
me
to
what
would
have
been
produced
had
i
been
sufficed
in
the
free
and
open
air
to
wait
until
the
cool
moonbeams
fell
upon
me
varney
varney
said
charles
holland
you
will
not
succeed
in
convincing
me
of
your
supernatural
powers
i
hold
such
feelings
and
sensations
at
arm's
length
i
will
not--i
cannot
assume
you
to
be
what
you
affect
i
ask
for
no
man's
belief
i
know
that
which
i
know
and
gathering
experience
from
the
coincidences
of
different
phenomena
i
am
compelled
to
arrive
at
certain
conclusions
believe
what
you
please
doubt
what
you
please
but
i
say
again
that
i
am
not
as
other
men
i
am
in
no
condition
to
depute
your
proposition
i
wish
not
to
dispute
it
but
you
are
wandering
varney
from
the
point
i
wait
anxiously
for
a
continuation
of
your
narrative
i
know
that
i
am
wandering
from
it--i
know
well
that
i
am
wandering
from
it
and
that
the
reason
i
do
so
is
that
i
dread
that
continuation
that
dread
will
nor
be
the
less
for
its
postponement
you
are
right
but
tell
me
charles
holland
although
you
are
young
you
have
been
about
in
the
great
world
sufficiently
to
form
correct
opinions
and
to
understand
that
which
is
related
to
you
drawing
proper
deductions
from
certain
facts
and
arriving
possibly
at
more
correct
conclusions
than
some
of
maturer
years
with
less
wisdom
i
will
freely
answer
varney
any
question
you
may
put
to
me
i
know
it
tell
me
then
what
measure
of
guilt
you
attach
to
me
in
the
transaction
i
have
noticed
to
you
it
seems
then
to
me
that
not
contemplating
the
man's
murder
you
cannot
be
accused
of
the
act
although
a
set
of
fortuitous
circumstances
made
you
appear
an
accomplice
to
its
commission
you
think
i
may
be
acquitted
you
can
acquit
yourself
knowing
that
you
did
not
contemplate
the
murder
i
did
not
contemplate
it
i
know
not
what
desperate
deed
i
should
have
stopped
short
at
then
in
the
height
of
my
distress
but
i
neither
contemplated
taking
that
man's
life
nor
did
i
strike
the
blow
which
sent
him
from
existence
there
is
even
some
excuse
as
regards
the
higher
crime
for
marmaduke
bannerworth
think
you
so
yes
he
thought
that
you
were
killed
and
impulsively
he
might
have
struck
the
blow
that
made
him
a
murderer
be
it
so
i
am
willing
extremely
willing
that
anything
should
occur
that
should
remove
the
odium
of
guilt
from
any
man
be
it
so
i
say
with
all
my
heart
but
now
charles
holland
i
feel
that
we
must
meet
again
ere
i
can
tell
you
all
but
in
the
meantime
let
flora
bannerworth
rest
in
peace--she
need
dread
nothing
from
me
avarice
and
revenge
the
two
passions
which
found
a
home
in
my
heart
are
now
stifled
for
ever
revenge
did
you
say
revenge
i
did
whence
the
marvel
am
i
not
sufficiently
human
for
that
but
you
coupled
it
with
the
name
of
flora
bannerworth
i
did
and
that
is
part
of
my
mystery
a
mystery
indeed
to
imagine
that
such
a
being
as
flora
could
awaken
any
such
feeling
in
your
heart--a
most
abundant
mystery
it
is
so
i
do
not
affect
to
deny
it
but
yet
it
is
true
although
so
greatly
mysterious
but
tell
her
that
although
at
one
time
i
looked
upon
her
as
one
whom
i
cared
not
if
i
injured
her
beauty
and
distress
changed
the
current
of
my
thoughts
and
won
upon
me
greatly
from
the
moment
i
found
i
had
the
power
to
become
the
bane
of
her
existence
i
ceased
to
wish
to
be
so
and
never
again
shall
she
experience
a
pang
of
alarm
from
varney
the
vampyre
your
message
shall
be
faithfully
delivered
and
doubt
not
that
it
will
be
received
with
grateful
feelings
nevertheless
i
should
have
much
wished
to
have
been
in
a
position
to
inform
her
of
more
particulars
come
to
me
here
at
midnight
to-morrow
and
you
shall
know
all
i
will
have
no
reservation
with
you
no
concealments
you
shall
know
whom
i
have
had
to
battle
against
and
how
it
is
that
a
world
of
evil
passions
took
possession
of
my
heart
and
made
me
what
i
am
are
you
firm
in
this
determination
varney--will
you
indeed
tell
me
no
more
to-night
no
more
i
have
said
it
leave
me
now
i
have
need
of
more
repose
for
of
late
sleep
has
seldom
closed
my
eyelids
charles
holland
was
convinced
from
the
positive
manner
in
which
he
spoke
that
nothing
more
in
the
shape
of
information
at
that
time
was
to
be
expected
from
varney
and
being
fearful
that
if
he
urged
this
strange
being
too
far
at
a
time
when
he
did
not
wish
it
he
might
refuse
all
further
communication
he
thought
it
prudent
to
leave
him
so
he
said
to
him--
be
assured
varney
i
shall
keep
the
appointment
you
have
made
with
an
expectation
when
we
do
meet
of
being
rewarded
by
a
recital
of
some
full
particulars
you
shall
not
be
disappointed
farewell
farewell
charles
holland
bade
him
adieu
and
left
the
place
although
he
had
now
acquired
all
the
information
he
hoped
to
take
away
with
him
when
varney
first
began
to
be
communicative
yet
when
he
came
to
consider
how
strange
and
unaccountable
a
being
he
had
been
in
communication
with
charles
could
not
but
congratulate
himself
that
he
had
heard
so
much
for
from
the
manner
of
varney
he
could
well
suppose
that
that
was
indeed
the
first
time
he
had
been
so
communicative
upon
subjects
which
evidently
held
so
conspicuous
a
place
in
his
heart
and
he
had
abundance
of
hope
likewise
from
what
had
been
said
by
varney
that
he
would
keep
his
word
and
communicate
to
him
fully
all
else
that
he
required
to
know
and
when
he
recollected
those
words
which
varney
had
used
signifying
that
he
knew
the
danger
of
half
confidences
that
hope
grew
into
a
certainty
and
charles
began
to
have
no
doubt
but
that
on
the
next
evening
all
that
was
mysterious
in
the
various
affairs
connected
with
the
vampyre
would
become
clear
and
open
to
the
light
of
day
he
strolled
down
the
lane
in
which
the
lone
house
was
situated
revolving
these
matters
in
his
mind
and
when
he
arrived
at
its
entrance
he
was
rather
surprised
to
see
a
throng
of
persons
hastily
moving
onward
with
come
appearance
of
dismay
about
them
and
anxiety
depicted
upon
their
countenances
he
stopped
a
lad
and
inquired
of
him
the
cause
of
the
seeming
tumult
why
sir
the
fact
is
said
the
boy
a
crowd
from
the
town's
been
burning
down
bannerworth
hall
and
they've
killed
a
man
bannerworth
hall
you
must
be
mistaken
well
sir
i
ought
not
to
call
it
bannerworth
hall
because
i
mean
the
old
ruins
in
the
neighbourhood
that
are
supposed
to
have
been
originally
bannerworth
hall
before
the
house
now
called
such
was
built
and
moreover
as
the
bannerworths
have
always
had
a
garden
there
and
two
or
three
old
sheds
the
people
in
the
town
called
it
bannerworth
hall
in
common
with
the
other
building
i
understand
and
do
you
say
that
all
have
been
destroyed
yes
sir
all
that
was
capable
of
being
burnt
has
been
burnt
and
what
is
more
a
man
has
been
killed
among
the
ruins
we
don't
know
who
he
is
but
the
folks
said
he
was
a
vampyre
and
they
left
him
for
dead
when
will
these
terrible
outrages
cease
oh
varney
varney
you
have
much
to
answer
for
even
if
in
your
conscience
you
succeed
in
acquitting
yourself
of
the
murder
some
of
the
particulars
concerning
which
you
have
informed
me
of
the
mysterious
arrival
at
the
inn--the
hungarian
nobleman--the
letter
to
varney
illustration
while
these
affairs
are
proceeding
and
when
there
seems
every
appearance
of
sir
francis
varney
himself
quickly
putting
an
end
to
some
of
the
vexatious
circumstances
connected
with
himself
and
the
bannerworth
family
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
notice
an
occurrence
which
took
place
at
the
same
inn
which
the
admiral
had
made
such
a
scene
of
confusion
upon
the
occasion
of
his
first
arrival
in
the
town
not
since
the
admiral
had
arrived
with
jack
pringle
and
so
disturbed
the
whole
economy
of
the
household
was
there
so
much
curiosity
excited
as
on
the
morning
following
the
interview
which
charles
holland
had
had
with
varney
the
vampyre
the
inn
was
scarcely
opened
when
a
stranger
arrived
mounted
on
a
coal-black
horse
and
alighting
he
surrendered
the
bridle
into
the
hands
of
a
boy
who
happened
to
be
at
the
inn-door
and
stalked
slowly
and
solemnly
into
the
building
he
was
tall
and
of
a
cadaverous
aspect
in
attire
he
was
plainly
apparelled
but
there
was
no
appearance
of
poverty
about
him
on
the
contrary
what
he
really
had
on
was
of
a
rich
and
costly
character
although
destitute
of
ornament
he
sat
down
in
the
first
room
that
presented
itself
and
awaited
the
appearance
of
the
landlord
who
upon
being
informed
that
a
guest
of
apparently
ample
means
and
of
some
consequence
had
entered
the
place
hastily
went
to
him
to
receive
his
commands
with
a
profusion
of
bows
our
old
friend
who
had
been
so
obsequious
to
admiral
bell
entered
the
room
and
begged
to
know
what
orders
the
gentleman
had
for
him
i
presume
said
the
stranger
in
a
deep
solemn
voice
i
presume
that
you
have
no
objection
for
a
few
days
that
i
shall
remain
in
this
town
to
board
and
lodge
me
for
a
certain
price
which
you
can
name
to
me
at
once
certainly
sir
said
the
landlord
any
way
you
please
without
wine
sir
i
presume
as
you
please
make
your
own
arrangements
well
sir
as
we
can't
tell
of
course
what
wine
a
gentleman
may
drink
but
when
we
come
to
consider
breakfast
dinner
tea
and
supper
and
a
bed
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
a
private
sitting-room
i
suppose
sir
certainly
you
would
not
then
think
sir
a
matter
of
four
guineas
a
week
will
be
too
much
perhaps
i
told
you
to
name
your
own
charge
let
it
be
four
guineas
if
you
had
said
eight
i
should
have
paid
it
good
god
said
the
publican
here's
a
damned
fool
that
i
am
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
didn't
mean
you
now
i
could
punch
my
own
head--will
you
have
breakfast
at
once
sir
and
then
we
shall
begin
regular
you
know
sir
have
what
breakfast
breakfast
you
know
sir
tea
coffee
cocoa
or
chocolate
ham
eggs
or
a
bit
of
grilled
fowl
cold
sirloin
of
roast
beef
or
a
red
herring--anything
you
like
sir
i
never
take
breakfast
so
you
may
spare
yourself
the
trouble
of
providing
anything
for
me
not
take
breakfast
sir
not
take
breakfast
would
you
like
to
take
anything
to
drink
then
sir
people
say
it's
an
odd
time
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
drink
but
for
my
part
i
always
have
thought
that
you
couldn't
begin
a
good
thing
too
soon
i
live
upon
drink
said
the
stranger
but
you
have
none
in
the
cellar
that
will
suit
me
indeed
sir
no
no
i
am
certain
why
we've
got
some
claret
now
sir
said
the
landlord
which
may
look
like
blood
and
yet
not
be
it
like
what
sir--damn
my
rags
begone
begone
the
stranger
uttered
these
words
so
peremptorily
that
the
landlord
hastily
left
the
room
and
going
into
his
own
bar
he
gave
himself
so
small
a
tap
on
the
side
of
the
head
that
it
would
not
have
hurt
a
fly
as
he
said--
i
could
punch
myself
into
bits
i
could
tear
my
hair
out
by
the
roots
and
then
he
pulled
a
little
bit
of
his
hair
so
gently
and
tenderly
that
it
showed
what
a
man
of
discretion
he
was
even
in
the
worst
of
all
his
agony
of
passion
the
idea
he
added
of
a
fellow
coming
here
paying
four
guineas
a
week
for
board
and
lodging
telling
me
he
would
not
have
minded
eight
and
then
not
wanting
any
breakfast
it's
enough
to
aggravate
half
a
dozen
saints
but
what
an
odd
fish
he
looks
at
this
moment
the
ostler
came
in
and
standing
at
the
bar
he
wiped
his
mouth
with
his
sleeve
as
he
said--
i
suppose
you'll
stand
a
quart
for
that
master
a
quart
for
what
you
vagabond
a
quart
because
i've
done
myself
up
in
heaps
a
quart
because
i'm
fit
to
pull
myself
into
fiddlestrings
no
said
the
ostler
because
i've
just
put
up
the
gentleman's
horse
what
gentleman's
horse
why
the
big-looking
fellow
with
the
white
face
now
in
the
parlour
what
did
he
come
on
a
horse
sam
what
sort
of
a
looking
creature
is
it
you
may
judge
of
a
man
from
the
sort
of
horse-company
he
keeps
well
then
sir
i
hardly
know
it's
coal
black
and
looks
as
knowing
as
possible
it's
tried
twice
to
get
a
kick
at
me
but
i
was
down
upon
him
and
put
the
bucket
in
his
way
howsomdever
i
don't
think
it's
a
bad
animal
as
a
animal
mind
you
sir
though
a
little
bit
wicious
or
so
well
said
the
publican
as
he
drew
the
ostler
half
a
pint
instead
of
a
quart
you're
always
drinking
take
that
blow
me
said
the
ostler
half
a
pint
master
plague
take
you
i
can't
stand
parleying
with
you
there's
the
parlour
bell
perhaps
after
all
he
will
have
some
breakfast
while
the
landlord
was
away
the
ostler
helped
himself
to
a
quart
of
the
strongest
ale
which
by
a
singular
faculty
that
he
had
acquired
he
poured
down
his
throat
without
any
effort
at
swallowing
holding
his
head
back
and
the
jug
at
a
little
distance
from
his
mouth
having
accomplished
this
feat
he
reversed
the
jug
giving
it
a
knowing
tap
with
his
knuckles
as
though
he
would
have
signified
to
all
the
world
that
it
was
empty
and
that
he
had
accomplished
what
he
desired
in
the
meantime
the
landlord
had
made
his
way
to
his
strange
guest
who
said
to
him
when
he
came
into
the
room
is
there
not
one
sir
francis
varney
residing
in
this
town
the
devil
thought
the
landlord
this
is
another
of
them
i'll
bet
a
guinea
sir
francis
varney
sir
did
you
say
why
sir
there
was
a
sir
francis
varney
but
folks
seem
to
think
as
how
he's
no
better
than
he
should
be--a
sort
of
vampyre
sir
if
you
know
what
that
is
i
have
certainly
heard
of
such
things
but
can
you
not
tell
me
varney's
address
i
wish
to
see
him
well
then
sir
i
cannot
tell
it
to
you
for
there's
really
been
such
a
commotion
and
such
a
riot
about
him
that
he's
taken
himself
off
i
think
altogether
and
we
can
hear
nothing
of
him
lord
bless
you
sir
they
burnt
down
his
house
and
hunted
him
about
so
that
i
don't
think
that
he'll
ever
show
his
face
here
again
and
cannot
you
tell
me
where
he
was
seen
last
that
i
cannot
sir
but
if
anybody
knows
anything
about
him
it's
mr
henry
bannerworth
or
perhaps
dr
chillingworth
for
they
have
had
more
to
do
with
him
than
anybody
else
indeed
and
can
you
tell
me
the
address
of
the
former
individual
that
i
can't
sir
for
the
bannerworths
have
left
the
hall
as
for
the
doctor
sir
you'll
see
his
house
in
the
high-street
with
a
large
brass
plate
on
the
door
so
that
you
cannot
mistake
it
it's
no
9
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
i
thank
you
for
so
much
information
said
the
stranger
and
rising
he
walked
to
the
door
before
however
he
left
he
turned
and
added--you
can
say
if
you
should
by
chance
meet
mr
bannerworth
that
a
hungarian
nobleman
wishes
to
speak
to
him
concerning
sir
francis
varney
the
vampyre
a
what
sir
a
nobleman
from
hungary
was
the
reply
the
deuce
said
the
landlord
as
he
looked
after
him
he
don't
seem
at
all
hungry
here
not
thirsty
neither
what
does
he
mean
by
a
nobleman
from
hungary
the
idea
of
a
man
talking
about
hungry
and
not
taking
any
breakfast
he's
queering
me
i'll
be
hanged
if
i'll
stand
it
here
i
clearly
lose
four
guineas
a
week
and
then
get
made
game
of
besides
a
nobleman
indeed
i
think
i
see
him
why
he
isn't
quite
so
big
as
old
slaney
the
butcher
it's
a
do
i'll
have
at
him
when
he
comes
back
meanwhile
the
unconscious
object
of
this
soliloquy
passed
down
the
high-street
until
he
came
to
dr
chillingworth's
at
whose
door
he
knocked
now
mrs
chillingworth
had
been
waiting
the
whole
night
for
the
return
of
the
doctor
who
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
and
consequently
that
lady's
temper
had
become
acidulated
to
an
uncommon
extent
and
when
she
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
something
possessed
her
that
it
could
be
no
other
than
her
spouse
and
she
prepared
to
give
him
that
warm
reception
which
she
considered
he
had
a
right
as
a
married
man
to
expect
after
such
conduct
she
hurriedly
filled
a
tolerably
sized
hand-basin
with
not
the
cleanest
water
in
the
world
and
then
opening
the
door
hurriedly
with
one
hand
she
slouced
the
contents
into
the
face
of
the
intruder
exclaiming--
now
you've
caught
it
d--n
said
the
hungarian
nobleman
and
then
mrs
chillingworth
uttered
a
scream
for
she
feared
she
had
made
a
mistake
oh
sir
i'm
very
sorry
but
i
thought
it
was
my
husband
but
if
you
did
said
the
stranger
there
was
no
occasion
to
drown
him
with
a
basin
of
soap-suds
it
is
your
husband
i
want
madam
if
he
be
dr
chillingworth
then
indeed
you
must
go
on
wanting
him
sir
for
he's
not
been
to
his
own
home
for
a
day
and
a
night
he
takes
up
all
his
time
in
hunting
after
that
beastly
vampyre
ah
sir
francis
varney
you
mean
i
do
and
i'd
varney
him
if
i
caught
hold
of
him
can
you
give
me
the
least
idea
of
where
he
can
be
found
of
course
i
can
indeed
where
said
the
stranger
eagerly
in
some
churchyard
to
be
sure
gobbling
up
the
dead
bodies
with
this
mrs
chillingworth
shut
the
door
with
a
bang
that
nearly
flattened
the
hungarian's
nose
with
his
face
and
he
was
fain
to
walk
away
quite
convinced
that
there
was
no
information
to
be
had
in
that
quarter
he
returned
to
the
inn
and
having
told
the
landlord
that
he
would
give
a
handsome
reward
to
any
one
who
would
discover
to
him
the
retreat
of
sir
francis
varney
he
shut
himself
up
in
an
apartment
alone
and
was
busy
for
a
time
in
writing
letters
although
the
sum
which
the
stranger
offered
was
an
indefinite
one
the
landlord
mentioned
the
matter
across
the
bar
to
several
persons
but
all
of
them
shook
their
heads
believing
it
to
be
a
very
perilous
adventure
indeed
to
have
anything
to
do
with
so
troublesome
a
subject
as
sir
francis
varney
as
the
day
advanced
however
a
young
lad
presented
himself
and
asked
to
see
the
gentleman
who
had
been
inquiring
for
varney
the
landlord
severely
questioned
and
cross-questioned
him
with
the
hope
of
discovering
if
he
had
any
information
but
the
boy
was
quite
obdurate
and
would
speak
to
no
one
but
the
person
who
had
offered
the
reward
so
that
mine
host
was
compelled
to
introduce
him
to
the
hungarian
nobleman
who
as
yet
had
neither
eaten
nor
drunk
in
the
house
the
boy
wore
upon
his
countenance
the
very
expression
of
juvenile
cunning
and
when
the
stranger
asked
him
if
he
really
was
in
possession
of
any
information
concerning
the
retreat
of
sir
francis
varney
he
said--
i
can
tell
you
where
he
is
but
what
are
you
going
to
give
what
sum
do
you
require
said
the
stranger
a
whole
half-crown
it
is
your's
and
if
your
information
prove
correct
come
to-morrow
and
i'll
add
another
to
it
always
provided
likewise
you
keep
the
secret
from
any
one
else
trust
me
for
that
said
the
boy
i
live
with
my
grandmother
she's
precious
old
and
has
got
a
cottage
we
sell
milk
and
cakes
sticky
stuff
and
pennywinkles
a
goodly
collection
go
on
well
sir
this
morning
there
comes
a
man
in
with
a
bottle
and
he
buys
a
bottle
full
of
milk
and
a
loaf
i
saw
him
and
i
knew
it
was
varney
the
vampyre
you
followed
him
of
course
i
did
sir
and
he's
staying
at
the
house
that's
to
let
down
the
lane
round
the
corner
by
mr
biggs's
and
past
lee's
garden
leaving
old
slaney's
stacks
on
your
right
hand
and
so
cutting
on
till
you
come
to
grants's
meadow
when
you'll
see
old
madhunter
a
brick-field
staring
of
you
in
the
face
and
arter
that--
peace--peace--you
shall
yourself
conduct
me
come
to
this
place
at
sunset
be
secret
and
probably
ten
times
the
reward
you
have
already
received
may
be
yours
said
the
stranger
what
ten
half-crowns
yes
i
will
keep
my
word
with
you
what
a
go
i
know
what
i'll
do
i'll
set
up
as
a
show
man
and
what
a
glorious
treat
it
will
be
to
peep
through
one
of
the
holes
all
day
myself
and
get
somebody
to
pull
the
strings
up
and
down
and
when
i'm
tired
of
that
i
can
blaze
away
upon
the
trumpet
like
one
o'clock
i
think
i
see
me
here
you
sees
the
duke
of
marlborough
a
whopping
of
everybody
and
here
you
see
the
frenchmen
flying
about
like
parched
peas
in
a
sifter
the
excited
populace--varney
hunted--the
place
of
refuge
illustration
there
seemed
now
a
complete
lull
in
the
proceedings
as
connected
with
varney
the
vampyre
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
executioner
who
had
been
as
solicitous
as
varney
to
obtain
undisputed
possession
of
bannerworth
hall
has
fallen
a
victim
to
the
indiscriminating
rage
of
the
mob
varney
himself
is
a
fugitive
and
bound
by
the
most
solemn
ties
to
charles
holland
not
only
to
communicate
to
him
such
particulars
of
the
past
as
will
bring
satisfaction
to
his
mind
but
to
abstain
from
any
act
which
for
the
future
shall
exercise
a
disastrous
influence
upon
the
happiness
of
flora
the
doctor
and
the
admiral
with
henry
had
betaken
themselves
from
the
hall
as
we
had
recorded
and
in
due
time
reached
the
cottage
where
flora
and
her
mother
had
found
a
temporary
refuge
mrs
bannerworth
was
up
but
flora
was
sleeping
and
although
the
tidings
they
had
to
tell
were
of
a
curious
and
mixed
nature
they
would
not
have
her
disturbed
to
listen
to
them
and
likewise
they
were
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
since
they
knew
not
exactly
what
had
become
of
charles
holland
to
think
that
they
would
probably
be
spared
the
necessity
of
saying
they
could
not
account
for
his
absence
that
he
had
gone
upon
some
expedition
probably
dangerous
and
so
one
which
he
did
not
wish
to
communicate
the
particulars
of
to
his
friends
lest
they
should
make
a
strong
attempt
to
dissuade
him
from
it
they
were
induced
to
believe
but
yet
they
had
that
confidence
in
his
courage
and
active
intellectual
resources
to
believe
that
he
would
come
through
it
unscathed
and
probably
shortly
show
himself
at
the
cottage
in
this
hope
they
were
not
disappointed
for
in
about
two
hours
charles
made
his
appearance
but
until
he
began
to
be
questioned
concerning
his
absence
by
the
admiral
he
scarcely
considered
the
kind
of
dilemma
he
had
put
himself
into
by
the
promise
of
secrecy
he
had
given
to
varney
and
was
a
little
puzzled
to
think
how
much
he
might
tell
and
how
much
he
was
bound
in
honour
to
conceal
avast
there
cried
the
admiral
what's
become
of
your
tongue
charles
you've
been
on
some
cruize
i'll
be
bound
haul
over
the
ship's
books
and
tell
us
what's
happened
i
have
been
upon
an
adventure
said
charles
which
i
hope
will
be
productive
of
beneficial
results
to
us
all
but
the
fact
is
i
have
made
a
promise
perhaps
incautiously
that
i
will
not
communicate
what
i
know
whew
said
the
admiral
that's
awkward
but
however
if
a
man
said
under
sealed
instructions
there's
an
end
of
it
i
remember
when
i
was
off
candia
once---
ha
interposed
jack
that
was
the
time
you
tumbled
over
the
blessed
binnacle
all
in
consequence
of
taking
too
much
madeira
i
remember
it
too--it's
an
out
and
out
good
story
that
'ere
you
took
a
rope's
end
you
know
and
laid
into
the
bowsprit
and
says
you
'get
up
you
lubber'
says
you
all
the
while
a
thinking
i
supposes
as
it
was
long
jack
ingram
the
carpenter's
mate
laying
asleep
what
a
lark
this
scoundrel
will
be
the
death
of
me
said
the
admiral
there
isn't
one
word
of
truth
in
what
he
says
i
never
got
drunk
in
all
my
life
as
everybody
knows
jack
affairs
are
getting
serious
between
you
and
i--we
must
part
and
for
good
it's
a
good
many
times
that
i've
told
you
you've
forgot
the
difference
between
the
quarter-deck
and
the
caboose
now
i'm
serious--you're
off
the
ship's
books
and
there's
an
end
of
you
very
good
said
jack
i'm
willing
i'll
leave
you
do
you
think
i
want
to
keep
you
any
longer
good
bye
old
bloak--i'll
leave
you
to
repent
and
when
old
grim
death
comes
yard-arm
and
yard-arm
with
you
and
you
can't
shake
off
his
boarding-tackle
you'll
say
'where's
jack
pringle'
says
you
and
then
what's
his
mane--oh
ah
echo
you
call
it--echo'll
say
it's
d----d
if
it
knows
jack
turned
upon
his
heel
and
before
the
admiral
could
make
any
reply
he
left
the
place
what's
the
rascal
up
to
now
said
the
admiral
i
really
didn't
think
he'd
have
taken
me
at
my
word
oh
then
after
all
you
didn't
mean
it
uncle
said
charles
what's
that
to
you
you
lubber
whether
i
mean
it
or
not
you
shore-going
squab
of
course
i
expect
everybody
to
desert
an
old
hulk
rats
and
all--and
now
jack
pringle's
gone
the
vagabond
couldn't
he
stay
and
get
drunk
as
long
as
he
liked
didn't
he
say
what
he
pleased
and
do
what
he
pleased
the
mutinous
thief
didn't
he
say
i
run
away
from
a
frenchman
off
cape
ushant
and
didn't
i
put
up
with
that
but
my
dear
uncle
you
sent
him
away
yourself
i
didn't
and
you
know
i
didn't
but
i
see
how
it
is
you've
disgusted
jack
among
you
a
better
seaman
never
trod
the
deck
of
a
man-of-war
but
his
drunkenness
uncle
it's
a
lie
i
don't
believe
he
ever
got
drunk
i
believe
you
all
invented
it
and
jack's
so
good-natured
he
tumbled
about
just
to
keep
you
in
countenance
but
his
insolence
uncle
his
gross
insolence
towards
you--his
inventions
his
exaggerations
of
the
truth
avast
there--avast
there--none
of
that
master
charlie
jack
couldn't
do
anything
of
the
sort
and
i
means
to
say
this
that
if
jack
was
here
now
i'd
stick
up
for
him
and
say
he
was
a
good
seaman
tip
us
your
fin
then
said
jack
darting
into
the
room
do
you
think
i'd
leave
you
you
d----d
old
fool
what
would
become
of
you
i
wonder
if
i
wasn't
to
take
you
in
to
dry
nurse
why
you
blessed
old
babby
what
do
you
mean
by
it
jack
you
villain
ah
go
on
and
call
me
a
villain
as
much
as
you
like
don't
you
remember
when
the
bullets
were
scuttling
our
nobs
i
do
i
do
jack
tip
us
your
fin
old
fellow
you've
saved
my
life
more
than
once
it's
a
lie
it
ain't
you
did
i
say
you
bed----d
and
thus
was
the
most
serious
misunderstanding
that
these
two
worthies
ever
had
together
made
up
the
real
fact
is
that
the
admiral
could
as
little
do
without
jack
as
he
could
have
done
without
food
and
as
for
pringle
he
no
more
thought
of
leaving
the
old
commodore
than
of--what
shall
we
say
forswearing
him
jack
himself
could
not
have
taken
a
stronger
oath
but
the
old
admiral
had
suffered
so
much
from
the
idea
that
jack
had
actually
left
him
that
although
he
abused
him
as
usual
often
enough
he
never
again
talked
of
taking
him
off
the
ship's
books
and
to
the
credit
of
jack
be
it
spoken
he
took
no
advantage
of
the
circumstance
and
only
got
drunk
just
as
usual
and
called
his
master
an
old
fool
whenever
it
suited
him
the
hungarian
nobleman
gets
into
danger--he
is
fired
at
and
shows
some
of
his
quality
illustration
considerably
delighted
was
the
hungarian
not
only
at
the
news
he
had
received
from
the
boy
but
as
well
for
the
cheapness
of
it
probably
he
did
not
conceive
it
possible
that
the
secret
of
the
retreat
of
such
a
man
as
varney
could
have
been
attained
so
easily
he
waited
with
great
impatience
for
the
evening
and
stirred
not
from
the
inn
for
several
hours
neither
did
he
take
any
refreshment
notwithstanding
he
had
made
so
liberal
an
arrangement
with
the
landlord
to
be
supplied
all
this
was
a
matter
of
great
excitement
and
speculation
in
the
inn
so
much
so
indeed
that
the
landlord
sent
for
some
of
the
oldest
customers
of
his
house
regular
topers
who
sat
there
every
evening
indulging
in
strong
drinks
and
pipes
and
tobacco
to
ask
their
serious
advice
as
to
what
he
should
do
as
if
it
were
necessary
he
should
do
anything
at
all
but
somehow
or
another
these
wiseacres
who
assembled
at
the
landlord's
bidding
and
sat
down
with
something
strong
before
them
in
the
bar
parlour
never
once
seemed
to
think
that
a
man
might
if
he
choosed
come
to
an
inn
and
agree
to
pay
four
guineas
a
week
for
board
and
lodging
and
yet
take
nothing
at
all
no
they
could
not
understand
it
and
therefore
they
would
not
have
it
it
was
quite
monstrous
that
anybody
should
attempt
to
do
anything
so
completely
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
proceeding
it
was
not
to
be
borne
and
as
in
this
country
it
happens
free
and
enlightened
as
we
are
that
no
man
can
commit
a
greater
social
offence
than
doing
something
that
his
neighbours
never
thought
of
doing
themselves
the
hungarian
nobleman
was
voted
a
most
dangerous
character
and
in
fact
not
to
be
put
up
with
i
shouldn't
have
thought
so
much
of
it
said
the
landlord
but
only
look
at
the
aggravation
of
the
thing
after
i
have
asked
him
four
guineas
a
week
and
expected
to
be
beaten
down
to
two
to
be
then
told
that
he
would
not
have
cared
if
it
had
been
eight
it
is
enough
to
aggravate
a
saint
well
i
agree
with
you
there
said
another
that's
just
what
it
is
and
i
only
wonder
that
a
man
of
your
sagacity
has
not
quite
understood
it
before
understood
what
why
that
he
is
a
vampyre
he
has
heard
of
sir
francis
varney
that's
the
fact
and
he's
come
to
see
him
birds
of
a
feather
you
know
flock
together
and
now
we
shall
have
two
vampyres
in
the
town
instead
of
one
illustration
the
party
looked
rather
blank
at
this
suggestion
which
indeed
seemed
rather
uncomfortable
probably
the
landlord
had
just
opened
his
mouth
to
make
some
remark
when
he
was
stopped
by
the
violent
ringing
of
what
he
now
called
the
vampyre's
bell
since
it
proceeded
from
the
room
where
the
hungarian
nobleman
was
have
you
an
almanack
in
the
house
was
the
question
of
the
mysterious
guest
an
almanack
sir
well
i
really
don't
know
let
me
see
an
almanack
but
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
i
was
to
know
the
moon's
age
the
devil
thought
the
landlord
he's
a
vampyre
and
no
mistake
why
sir
as
to
the
moon's
age
it
was
a
full
moon
last
night
very
bright
and
beautiful
only
you
could
not
see
it
for
the
clouds
a
full
moon
last
night
said
the
mysterious
guest
thoughtfully
it
may
shine
then
brightly
to-night
and
if
so
all
will
be
well
i
thank
you--leave
the
room
do
you
mean
to
say
sir
you
don't
want
anything
to
eat
now
what
i
want
i'll
order
but
you
have
ordered
nothing
then
presume
that
i
want
nothing
the
discomfited
landlord
was
obliged
to
leave
the
room
for
there
was
no
such
a
thing
as
making
any
answer
to
this
and
so
still
further
confirmed
in
his
opinion
that
the
stranger
was
a
vampyre
that
came
to
see
sir
francis
varney
from
a
sympathetic
feeling
towards
him
he
again
reached
the
bar-parlour
you
may
depend
he
said
as
sure
as
eggs
is
eggs
that
he
is
a
vampyre
hilloa
he's
going
off--after
him--after
him
he
thinks
we
suspect
him
there
he
goes--down
the
high-street
the
landlord
ran
out
and
so
did
those
who
were
with
him
one
of
whom
carried
his
brandy
and
water
in
his
hand
which
being
too
hot
for
him
to
swallow
all
at
once
he
still
could
not
think
of
leaving
behind
it
was
now
gelling
rapidly
dark
and
the
mysterious
stranger
was
actually
proceeding
towards
the
lane
to
keep
his
appointment
with
the
boy
who
had
promised
to
conduct
him
to
the
hiding-place
of
sir
francis
varney
he
had
not
proceeded
far
however
before
he
began
to
suspect
that
he
was
followed
as
it
was
evident
on
the
instant
that
he
altered
his
course
for
instead
of
walking
down
the
lane
where
the
boy
was
waiting
for
him
he
went
right
on
and
seemed
desirous
of
making
his
way
into
the
open
country
between
the
town
and
bannerworth
hall
his
pursuers--for
they
assumed
that
character--when
they
saw
this
became
anxious
to
intercept
him
and
thinking
that
the
greater
force
they
had
the
better
they
called
out
aloud
as
they
passed
a
smithy
where
a
man
was
shoeing
a
horse--
jack
burdon
here
is
another
vampyre
the
deuce
there
is
said
the
person
who
was
addressed
i'll
soon
settle
him
here's
my
wife
gets
no
sleep
of
a
night
as
it
is
all
owing
to
that
varney
who
has
been
plaguing
us
so
long
i
won't
put
up
with
another
so
saying
he
snatched
from
a
hook
on
which
it
hung
an
old
fowling-piece
and
joined
the
pursuit
which
now
required
to
be
conducted
with
some
celerity
for
the
stranger
had
struck
into
the
open
country
and
was
getting
on
at
good
speed
the
last
remnants
of
the
twilight
were
fading
away
and
although
the
moon
had
actually
risen
its
rays
were
obscured
by
a
number
of
light
fleecy
clouds
which
although
they
did
not
promise
to
be
of
long
continuance
as
yet
certainly
impeded
the
light
where
is
he
going
said
the
blacksmith
he
seems
to
be
making
his
way
towards
the
mill-stream
no
said
another
don't
you
see
he
is
striking
higher
up
towards
the
old
ford
where
the
stepping-stones
are
he
is--he
is
cried
the
blacksmith
run
on--run
on
don't
you
see
he
is
crossing
it
now
tell
me
all
of
you
are
you
quite
sure
he
is
a
vampyre
and
no
mistake
he
ain't
the
exciseman
landlord
now
is
he
the
exciseman
the
devil
do
you
think
i
want
to
shoot
the
exciseman
very
good--then
here
goes
exclaimed
the
smith
he
stooped
and
just
as
the
brisk
night
air
blew
aside
the
clouds
from
before
the
face
of
the
moon
and
as
the
stranger
was
crossing
the
slippery
stones
he
fired
at
him





how
silently
and
sweetly
the
moon's
rays
fall
upon
the
water
upon
the
meadows
and
upon
the
woods
the
scenery
appeared
the
work
of
enchantment
some
fairy
land
waiting
the
appearance
of
its
inhabitants
no
sound
met
the
ear
the
very
wind
was
hushed
nothing
was
there
to
distract
the
sense
of
sight
save
the
power
of
reflection
this
indeed
would
aid
the
effect
of
such
a
scene
a
cloudless
sky
the
stars
all
radiant
with
beauty
while
the
moon
rising
higher
and
higher
in
the
heavens
increasing
in
the
strength
and
refulgence
of
her
light
and
dimming
the
very
stars
which
seemed
to
grow
gradually
invisible
as
the
majesty
of
the
queen
of
night
became
more
and
more
manifest
the
dark
woods
and
the
open
meadows
contrasted
more
and
more
strongly
like
light
and
shade
the
earth
and
sky
were
not
more
distinct
and
apart
and
the
ripling
stream
that
rushed
along
with
all
the
impetuosity
of
uneven
ground
the
banks
are
clothed
with
verdure
the
tall
sedges
here
and
there
lined
the
sides
beds
of
bulrushes
raised
their
heads
high
above
all
else
and
threw
out
their
round
clumps
of
blossoms
like
tufts
and
looked
strange
in
the
light
of
the
moon
here
and
there
too
the
willows
bent
gracefully
over
the
stream
and
their
long
leaves
were
wafted
and
borne
up
and
down
by
the
gentler
force
of
the
stream
below
the
stream
widened
and
ran
foaming
over
a
hard
stony
bottom
and
near
the
middle
is
a
heap
of
stones--of
large
stones
that
form
the
bed
of
the
river
from
which
the
water
has
washed
away
all
earthy
particles
and
left
them
by
themselves
these
stones
in
winter
could
not
be
seen
they
were
all
under
water
and
the
stream
washed
over
in
a
turbulent
and
tumultuous
manner
but
now
when
the
water
was
clear
and
low
they
are
many
of
them
positively
out
of
the
water
the
stream
running
around
and
through
their
interstices
the
water-weeds
here
and
there
lying
at
the
top
of
the
stream
and
blossoming
beautifully
the
daisy-like
blossoms
danced
and
waved
gently
on
the
moving
flood
at
the
same
time
they
shone
in
the
moonlight
like
fairy
faces
rising
from
the
depths
of
the
river
to
receive
the
principle
of
life
from
the
moon's
rays
'tis
sweet
to
wander
in
the
moonlight
at
such
an
hour
and
it
is
sweet
to
look
upon
such
a
scene
with
an
unruffled
mind
and
to
give
way
to
the
feelings
that
are
engendered
by
a
walk
by
the
river
side
see
the
moon
is
rising
higher
and
higher
the
shadows
grow
shorter
and
shorter
the
river
which
in
places
was
altogether
hidden
by
the
tall
willow
trees
now
gradually
becomes
less
and
less
hidden
and
the
water
becomes
more
and
more
lit
up
the
moonbeams
play
gracefully
on
the
rippling
surface
here
and
there
appearing
like
liquid
silver
that
each
instant
changed
its
position
and
surface
exposed
to
the
light
such
a
moment--such
a
scene
were
by
far
too
well
calculated
to
cause
the
most
solemn
and
serious
emotions
of
the
mind
and
he
must
have
been
but
at
best
insensible
who
could
wander
over
meadow
and
through
grove
and
yet
remain
untouched
by
the
scene
of
poetry
and
romance
in
which
he
breathed
and
moved
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
place
the
world
is
alive
with
all
the
finer
essences
of
mysterious
life
'tis
at
such
an
hour
that
the
spirits
quit
their
secret
abodes
and
visit
the
earth
and
whirl
round
the
enchanted
trees
'tis
now
the
spirits
of
earth
and
air
dance
their
giddy
flight
from
flower
to
flower
'tis
now
they
collect
and
exchange
their
greetings
the
wood
is
filled
with
them
the
meadows
teem
with
them
the
hedges
at
the
river
side
have
them
hidden
among
the
deep
green
leaves
and
blades
but
what
is
that
yonder
on
the
stones
partially
out
of
the
water--what
can
it
be
the
more
it
is
looked
at
the
more
it
resembles
the
human
form--and
yet
it
is
still
and
motionless
on
the
hard
stones--and
yet
it
is
a
human
form
the
legs
are
lying
in
the
water
the
arms
appear
to
be
partially
in
and
partially
out
they
seem
moved
by
the
stream
now
and
then
but
very
gently--so
slightly
indeed
that
it
might
well
be
questioned
if
it
moved
at
all
the
moon's
rays
had
not
yet
reached
it
the
bank
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
was
high
and
some
tall
trees
rose
up
and
obscured
the
moon
but
she
was
rising
higher
and
higher
each
moment
and
finally
when
it
has
reached
the
tops
of
those
trees
then
the
rays
will
reach
the
middle
of
the
river
and
then
by
degrees
it
will
reach
the
stones
in
the
river
and
finally
the
body
that
lies
there
so
still
and
so
mysteriously
how
it
came
there
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
it
appeared
as
though
when
the
waters
were
high
the
body
had
floated
down
and
at
the
subsidence
of
the
waters
it
had
been
left
upon
the
stones
and
now
it
was
exposed
to
view
it
was
strange
and
mysterious
and
those
who
might
look
upon
such
a
sight
would
feel
their
blood
chill
and
their
body
creep
to
contemplate
the
remains
of
humanity
in
such
a
place
and
in
such
a
condition
as
that
must
be
in
a
human
life
had
been
taken
how
who
could
tell
perhaps
accident
alone
was
the
cause
of
it
perhaps
some
one
had
taken
a
life
by
violent
means
and
thrown
the
body
in
the
waters
to
conceal
the
fact
and
the
crime
the
waters
had
brought
it
down
and
deposited
it
there
in
the
middle
of
the
river
without
any
human
creature
being
acquainted
with
the
fact
but
the
moon
rises--the
beams
come
trembling
through
the
tree
tops
and
straggling
branches
and
fall
upon
the
opposite
bank
and
there
lies
the
body
mid
stream
and
in
comparative
darkness
by
the
time
the
river
is
lit
up
by
the
moon's
rays
then
the
object
on
the
stones
will
be
visible
then
it
can
be
ascertained
what
appears
now
only
probable
namely
is
the
dark
object
a
human
form
or
not
in
the
absence
of
light
it
appears
to
be
so
but
when
the
flood
of
silver
light
falls
upon
it
it
would
be
placed
then
beyond
a
doubt
the
time
is
approaching--the
moon
each
moment
approaches
her
meridian
and
each
moment
do
the
rays
increase
in
number
and
in
strength
while
the
shadows
shorten
the
opposite
bank
each
moment
becomes
more
and
more
distinct
and
the
side
of
the
stream
the
green
rushes
and
sedges
all
by
degrees
come
full
into
view
now
and
then
a
fish
leaps
out
of
the
stream
and
just
exhibits
itself
as
much
as
to
say
there
are
things
living
in
the
stream
and
i
am
one
of
them
the
moment
is
one
of
awe--the
presence
of
that
mysterious
and
dreadful-looking
object
even
while
its
identity
remains
doubt
chills
the
heart--it
contracts
the
expanding
thoughts
to
that
one
object--all
interest
in
the
scene
lies
centered
in
that
one
point
what
could
it
be
what
else
but
a
human
body
what
else
could
assume
such
a
form
but
see
nearly
half
the
stream
is
lit
by
the
moonbeams
struggling
through
the
tree
tops
and
now
rising
above
them
the
light
increases
and
the
shadows
shorten
the
edge
of
the
bed
of
stones
now
becomes
lit
up
by
the
moonlight
the
rippling
stream
the
bubbles
and
the
tiny
spray
that
was
caused
by
the
rush
of
water
against
the
stones
seemed
like
sparkling
flashes
of
silver
fire
then
came
the
moonbeams
upon
the
body
for
it
was
raised
above
the
level
of
the
water
and
shewed
conspicuously
for
the
moonbeams
reached
the
body
before
they
fell
on
the
surrounding
water
for
that
reason
then
it
was
the
body
presented
a
strange
and
ghastly
object
against
a
deep
dark
background
by
which
it
was
surrounded
but
this
did
not
last
long--the
water
in
another
minute
was
lit
up
by
the
moon's
pale
beams
and
then
indeed
could
be
plainly
enough
seen
the
body
of
a
man
lying
on
the
heap
of
stones
motionless
and
ghastly
the
colourless
hue
of
the
moonlight
gave
the
object
a
most
horrific
and
terrible
appearance
the
face
of
the
dead
man
was
turned
towards
the
moon's
rays
and
the
body
seemed
to
receive
all
the
light
that
could
fall
upon
it
it
was
a
terrible
object
to
look
upon
and
one
that
added
a
new
and
singular
interest
to
the
scene
the
world
seemed
then
to
be
composed
almost
exclusively
of
still
life
and
the
body
was
no
impediment
to
the
stillness
of
the
scene
it
was
all
else
considered
a
calm
beautiful
scene
lovely
the
night
gorgeous
the
silvery
rays
that
lit
up
the
face
of
nature
the
hill
and
dale
meadow
and
wood
and
river
all
afforded
contrasts
strong
striking
and
strange
but
strange
and
more
strange
than
any
contrast
in
nature
was
that
afforded
to
the
calm
beauty
of
the
night
and
place
by
the
deep
stillness
and
quietude
imposed
upon
the
mind
by
that
motionless
human
body
the
moon's
rays
now
fell
upon
its
full
length
the
feet
were
lying
in
the
water
the
head
lay
back
with
its
features
turned
towards
the
quarter
of
the
heavens
where
the
moon
shone
from
the
hair
floated
on
the
shallow
water
while
the
face
and
body
were
exposed
to
all
influences
from
its
raised
and
prominent
position
the
moonbeams
had
scarcely
settled
upon
it--scarce
a
few
minutes--when
the
body
moved
was
it
the
water
that
moved
it
it
could
not
be
surely
that
the
moonbeams
had
the
power
of
recalling
life
into
that
inanimate
mass
that
lay
there
for
some
time
still
and
motionless
as
the
very
stones
on
which
it
lay
it
was
endued
with
life
the
dead
man
gradually
rose
up
and
leaned
himself
upon
his
elbow
he
paused
a
moment
like
one
newly
recalled
to
life
he
seemed
to
become
assured
he
did
live
he
passed
one
hand
through
his
hair
which
was
wet
and
then
rose
higher
into
a
sitting
posture
and
then
he
leaned
on
one
hand
inclining
himself
towards
the
moon
his
breast
heaved
with
life
and
a
kind
of
deep
inspiration
or
groan
came
from
him
as
he
first
awoke
to
life
and
then
he
seemed
to
pause
for
a
few
moments
he
turned
gradually
over
till
his
head
inclined
down
the
stream
just
below
the
water
deepened
and
ran
swiftly
and
silently
on
amid
meads
and
groves
of
trees
the
vampyre
was
revived
he
awoke
again
to
a
ghastly
life
he
turned
from
the
heap
of
stones
he
gradually
allowed
himself
to
sink
into
deep
water
and
then
with
a
loud
plunge
he
swam
to
the
centre
of
the
river
slowly
and
surely
did
he
swim
into
the
centre
of
the
river
and
down
the
stream
he
went
he
took
long
but
easy
strokes
for
he
was
going
down
the
stream
and
that
aided
him
for
some
distance
might
he
be
heard
and
seen
through
the
openings
in
the
trees
but
he
became
gradually
more
and
more
indistinct
till
sound
and
sight
both
ceased
and
the
vampyre
had
disappeared
during
the
continuance
of
this
singular
scene
not
one
word
had
passed
between
the
landlord
and
his
companions
when
the
blacksmith
fired
the
fowling-piece
and
saw
the
stranger
fall
apparently
lifeless
upon
the
stepping-stones
that
crossed
the
river
he
became
terrified
at
what
he
had
done
and
gazed
upon
the
seeming
lifeless
form
with
a
face
on
which
the
utmost
horror
was
depicted
they
all
seemed
transfixed
to
the
spot
and
although
each
would
have
given
worlds
to
move
away
a
kind
of
nightmare
seemed
to
possess
them
which
stunned
all
their
faculties
and
brought
over
them
a
torpidity
from
which
they
found
it
impossible
to
arouse
themselves
but
when
the
apparently
dead
man
moved
again
and
when
finally
the
body
which
appeared
so
destitute
of
life
rolled
into
the
stream
and
floated
away
with
the
tide
their
fright
might
be
considered
to
have
reached
its
climax
the
absence
of
the
body
however
had
seemingly
at
all
events
the
effect
of
releasing
them
from
the
mental
and
physical
thraldom
in
which
they
were
and
they
were
enabled
to
move
from
the
spot
which
they
did
immediately
making
their
way
towards
the
town
with
great
speed
as
they
got
near
they
held
a
sort
of
council
of
war
as
to
what
they
should
do
under
the
circumstances
the
result
of
which
was
that
they
came
to
a
conclusion
to
keep
all
that
they
had
done
and
seen
to
themselves
for
if
they
did
not
they
might
be
called
upon
for
some
very
troublesome
explanations
concerning
the
fate
of
the
supposed
hungarian
nobleman
whom
they
had
taken
upon
themselves
to
believe
was
a
vampyre
and
to
shoot
accordingly
without
taking
the
trouble
to
inquire
into
the
legality
of
such
an
act
how
such
a
secret
was
likely
to
be
kept
when
it
was
shared
amongst
seven
people
it
is
hard
to
say
but
if
it
were
so
kept
it
could
only
be
under
the
pressure
of
a
strong
feeling
of
self-preservation
they
were
forced
individually
of
course
to
account
for
their
absence
during
the
night
at
their
respective
homes
and
how
they
managed
to
do
that
is
best
known
to
themselves
as
to
the
landlord
he
felt
compelled
to
state
that
having
his
suspicions
of
his
guest
aroused
he
followed
him
on
a
walk
that
he
pretended
to
take
and
he
had
gone
so
far
that
at
length
he
had
given
up
the
chase
and
lost
his
own
way
in
returning
thus
was
it
then
that
this
affair
still
preserved
all
its
mystery
with
a
large
superadded
amount
of
fear
attendant
upon
it
for
if
the
mysterious
guest
were
really
anything
supernatural
might
he
not
come
again
in
a
much
more
fearful
shape
and
avenge
the
treatment
he
had
received
the
only
person
who
fell
any
disappointment
in
the
affair
or
whose
expectations
were
not
realised
was
the
boy
who
had
made
the
appointment
with
the
supposed
vampyre
at
the
end
of
the
lane
and
who
was
to
have
received
what
he
considered
so
large
a
reward
for
pointing
out
the
retreat
of
sir
francis
varney
he
waited
in
vain
for
the
arrival
of
the
hungarian
nobleman
and
at
last
indignation
got
the
better
of
him
and
he
walked
away
feeling
that
he
had
been
jilted
he
resolved
to
proceed
to
the
public-house
and
demand
the
half-crowns
which
had
been
so
liberally
promised
him
but
when
he
reached
there
he
found
that
the
party
whom
he
sought
was
not
within
nor
the
landlord
either
for
that
was
the
precise
time
when
that
worthy
individual
was
pursuing
his
guest
over
meadow
and
bill
through
brake
and
through
briar
towards
the
stepping
stones
on
the
river
what
the
boy
further
did
on
the
following
day
when
he
found
that
he
was
to
reap
no
more
benefit
for
the
adventure
we
shall
soon
perceive
as
for
the
landlord
he
did
endeavour
to
catch
a
few
hours'
brief
repose
but
as
he
dreamed
that
the
hungarian
nobleman
came
in
the
likeness
of
a
great
toad
and
sat
upon
his
chest
feeling
like
the
weight
of
a
mountain
while
he
the
landlord
tried
to
scream
and
cry
for
help
but
found
that
he
could
neither
do
one
thing
nor
the
other
we
may
guess
that
his
repose
did
not
at
all
invigorate
him
as
he
himself
expressed
it
he
got
up
all
of
a
shake
with
a
strong
impression
that
he
was
a
very
ill-used
individual
indeed
to
have
had
the
nightmare
in
the
day
time
and
now
we
will
return
to
the
cottage
where
the
bannerworth
family
were
at
all
events
making
themselves
quite
as
happy
as
they
did
at
their
ancient
mansion
in
order
to
see
what
is
there
passing
and
how
dr
chillingworth
made
an
effort
to
get
up
some
evidence
of
something
that
the
bannerworth
family
knew
nothing
of
therefore
could
not
very
well
be
expected
to
render
him
much
assistance
that
he
did
however
make
what
he
considered
an
important
discovery
we
shall
perceive
in
the
course
of
the
ensuing
chapter
in
which
it
will
be
seen
that
the
best
hidden
things
will
by
the
merest
accident
sometimes
come
to
light
and
that
too
when
least
expected
by
any
one
at
all
connected
with
the
result
the
discovery
of
the
pocket
book
of
marmaduke
bannerworth--its
mysterious
contents
illustration
the
little
episode
had
just
taken
place
which
we
have
recorded
between
the
old
admiral
and
jack
pringle
when
henry
bannerworth
and
charles
holland
stepped
aside
to
converse
charles
said
henry
it
has
become
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
put
an
end
to
this
state
of
dependence
in
which
we
all
live
upon
your
uncle
it
is
too
bad
to
think
that
because
through
fighting
the
battles
of
his
country
he
has
amassed
some
money
we
are
to
eat
it
up
my
dear
friend
said
charles
does
it
not
strike
you
that
it
would
be
a
great
deal
worse
than
too
bad
if
my
uncle
could
not
do
what
he
liked
with
his
own
yes
but
charles
that
is
not
the
question
i
think
it
is
though
i
know
not
what
other
question
you
can
make
of
it
we
have
all
talked
it
over
my
mother
my
brother
and
flora
and
my
brother
and
i
have
determined
if
this
state
of
things
should
last
much
longer
to
find
out
some
means
of
honourable
exertion
by
which
we
may
at
all
events
maintain
ourselves
without
being
burdensome
to
any
well
well
we
will
talk
of
that
another
time
nay
but
hear
me
we
were
thinking
that
if
we
went
into
some
branch
of
the
public
service
your
uncle
would
have
the
pleasure
such
we
are
quite
sure
it
would
be
to
him
of
assisting
us
greatly
by
his
name
and
influence
well
well
henry
that's
all
very
well
but
for
a
little
time
do
not
throw
up
the
old
man
and
make
him
unhappy
i
believe
i
am
his
only
relative
in
the
world
and
as
he
has
often
said
he
intended
leaving
me
heir
to
all
he
possesses
you
see
there
is
no
harm
done
by
you
receiving
a
small
portion
of
it
beforehand
and
said
henry
by
that
line
of
argument
we
are
to
find
an
excuse
for
robbing
your
uncle
in
the
fact
that
we
are
robbing
you
likewise
no
no
indeed
you
do
not
view
the
matter
rightly
well
all
i
can
say
is
charles
that
while
i
feel
and
while
we
all
feel
the
deepest
debt
of
gratitude
towards
your
uncle
it
is
our
duty
to
do
something
in
a
box
which
we
have
brought
with
us
from
the
hall
and
which
has
not
been
opened
since
our
father's
death
i
have
stumbled
over
some
articles
of
ancient
jewellery
and
plate
which
at
all
events
will
produce
something
but
which
you
must
not
part
with
nay
but
charles
these
are
things
i
knew
not
we
possessed
and
most
ill-suited
do
they
happen
to
be
to
our
fallen
fortunes
it
is
money
we
want
not
the
gewgaws
of
a
former
state
to
which
we
can
have
now
no
sort
of
pretension
nay
i
know
you
have
all
the
argument
but
still
is
there
something
sad
and
uncomfortable
to
one's
feelings
in
parting
with
such
things
as
those
which
have
been
in
families
for
many
years
but
we
knew
not
that
we
had
them
remember
that
charles
come
and
look
at
them
those
relics
of
a
bygone
age
may
amuse
you
and
as
regards
myself
there
are
no
circumstances
whatever
associated
with
them
that
give
them
any
extrinsic
value
so
laugh
at
them
or
admire
them
as
you
please
i
shall
most
likely
be
able
to
join
with
you
in
either
feeling
well
be
it
so--i
will
come
and
look
at
them
but
you
must
think
better
of
what
you
say
concerning
my
uncle
for
i
happen
to
know--which
you
ought
likewise
by
this
time--how
seriously
the
old
man
would
feel
any
rejection
on
your
part
of
the
good
he
fancies
he
is
doing
you
i
tell
you
henry
it
is
completely
his
hobby
and
let
him
have
earned
his
money
with
ten
times
the
danger
he
has
he
could
not
spend
it
with
anything
like
the
satisfaction
that
he
does
unless
he
were
allowed
to
dispose
of
it
in
this
way
well
well
be
it
so
for
a
time
the
fact
is
his
attachment
to
flora
is
so
great--which
is
a
most
fortunate
circumstance
for
me--that
i
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
that
she
cuts
me
out
of
one
half
my
estate
when
the
old
man
dies
but
come
we
will
look
at
your
ancient
bijouterie
henry
led
charles
into
an
apartment
of
the
cottage
where
some
of
the
few
things
had
been
placed
that
were
brought
from
bannerworth
hall
which
were
not
likely
to
be
in
constant
and
daily
use
among
these
things
happened
to
be
the
box
which
henry
had
mentioned
and
from
which
he
had
taken
a
miscellaneous
assortment
of
things
of
an
antique
and
singular
character
there
were
old
dresses
of
a
season
and
of
a
taste
long
gone
by
ancient
articles
of
defence
some
curiously
wrought
daggers
and
a
few
ornaments
pretty
but
valueless
along
with
others
of
more
sterling
pretensions
which
henry
pointed
out
to
charles
i
am
almost
inclined
to
think
said
the
latter
that
some
of
these
things
are
really
of
considerable
value
but
i
do
not
i
profess
to
be
an
accurate
judge
and
perhaps
i
am
more
taken
with
the
beauty
of
an
article
than
the
intrinsic
worth
what
is
that
which
you
have
just
taken
from
the
box
it
seems
a
half-mask
said
henry
made
of
silk
and
here
are
initial
letters
within
it--m
b
to
what
do
they
apply
marmaduke
bannerworth
my
father
i
regret
i
asked
you
nay
charles
you
need
not
years
have
now
elapsed
since
that
misguided
man
put
a
period
to
his
own
existence
in
the
gardens
of
bannerworth
hall
of
course
the
shock
was
a
great
one
to
us
all
although
i
must
confess
that
we
none
of
us
knew
much
of
a
father's
affections
but
time
reconciles
one
to
these
dispensations
and
to
a
friend
like
yourself
i
can
talk
upon
these
subjects
without
a
pang
he
laid
down
the
mask
and
proceeded
further
in
his
search
in
the
old
box
towards
the
bottom
of
it
there
were
some
books
and
crushed
in
by
the
side
of
them
there
was
an
ancient-looking
pocket-book
which
charles
pointed
out
saying--
there
henry
who
knows
but
you
may
find
a
fortune
when
you
least
expect
it
those
who
expect
nothing
said
henry
will
not
be
disappointed
at
all
events
as
regards
this
pocket-book
you
see
it
is
empty
not
quite
a
card
has
fallen
from
it
charles
took
up
the
card
and
read
upon
it
the
name
of
count
barrare
that
name
he
said
seems
familiar
to
me
ah
now
i
recollect
i
have
read
of
such
a
man
he
flourished
some
twenty
or
five-and-twenty
years
ago
and
was
considered
a
roue
of
the
first
water--a
finished
gamester
and
in
a
sort
of
brief
memoir
i
read
once
of
him
it
said
that
he
disappeared
suddenly
one
day
and
was
never
again
heard
of
indeed
i'm
not
puzzled
to
think
how
his
card
came
into
my
father's
pocket-book
they
met
at
some
gaming-house
and
if
some
old
pocket-book
of
the
count
barrare's
were
shaken
there
might
fall
from
it
a
card
with
the
name
of
mr
marmaduke
bannerworth
upon
it
is
there
nothing
further
in
the
pocket-book--no
memoranda
i
will
look
stay
here
is
something
upon
one
of
the
leaves--let
me
see--'mem
twenty-five
thousand
pounds
he
who
robs
the
robber
steals
little
it
was
not
meant
to
kill
him
but
it
will
be
unsafe
to
use
the
money
for
a
time--my
brain
seems
on
fire--the
remotest
hiding-place
in
the
house
is
behind
the
picture
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
charles
i
know
not
what
to
think
there
is
one
thing
though
that
i
do
know
and
what
is
that
it
is
my
father's
handwriting
i
have
many
scraps
of
his
and
his
peculiar
hand
is
familiar
to
me
it's
very
strange
then
what
it
can
refer
to
charles--charles
there
is
a
mystery
connected
with
our
fortunes
that
i
never
could
unravel
and
once
or
twice
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
upon
the
point
of
discovering
all
but
something
has
ever
interfered
to
prevent
us
and
we
have
been
thrown
back
into
the
realms
of
conjecture
my
father's
last
words
were
'the
money
is
hidden'
and
then
he
tried
to
add
something
but
death
stopped
his
utterance
now
does
it
not
almost
seem
that
this
memorandum
alluded
to
the
circumstance
it
does
indeed
and
then
scarcely
had
my
father
breathed
his
last
when
a
man
comes
and
asks
for
him
at
the
garden-gate
and
upon
hearing
that
he
is
dead
utters
some
imprecations
and
walks
away
well
henry
you
must
trust
to
time
and
circumstances
to
unravel
these
mysteries
for
myself
i
own
that
i
cannot
do
so
i
see
no
earthly
way
out
of
the
difficulty
whatever
but
still
it
does
appear
to
me
as
if
dr
chillingworth
knew
something
or
had
heard
something
with
which
he
really
ought
to
make
you
acquainted
do
not
blame
the
worthy
doctor
he
may
have
made
an
error
of
judgment
but
never
one
of
feeling
and
you
may
depend
if
he
is
keeping
anything
from
me
that
he
is
doing
so
from
some
excellent
motive
most
probably
because
he
thinks
it
will
give
me
pain
and
so
will
not
let
me
endure
any
unhappiness
from
it
unless
he
is
quite
certain
as
regards
the
facts
when
he
is
so
you
may
depend
he
will
be
communicative
and
i
shall
know
all
that
he
has
to
relate
but
charles
it
is
evident
to
me
that
you
too
are
keeping
something
i
yes
you
acknowledge
to
having
had
an
interview
and
a
friendly
one
with
varney
and
you
likewise
acknowledge
that
he
had
told
you
things
which
he
has
compelled
you
to
keep
secret
i
have
promised
to
keep
them
secret
and
i
deeply
regret
the
promise
that
i
have
made
there
cannot
be
anything
to
my
mind
more
essentially
disagreeable
than
to
have
one's
tongue
tied
in
one's
interview
with
friends
i
hate
to
hear
anything
that
i
may
not
repeat
to
those
whom
i
take
into
my
own
confidence
i
can
understand
the
feeling
but
here
comes
the
worthy
doctor
show
him
the
memorandum
i
will
as
dr
chillingworth
entered
the
apartments
henry
handed
him
the
memorandum
that
had
been
found
in
the
old
pocket-book
saying
as
he
did
so--
look
at
that
doctor
and
give
us
your
candid
opinion
upon
it
dr
chillingworth
fitted
on
his
spectacles
and
read
the
paper
carefully
at
its
conclusion
he
screwed
up
his
mouth
into
an
extremely
small
compass
and
doubling
up
the
paper
he
put
it
into
his
capacious
waistcoat
pocket
saying
as
he
did
so--
oh
oh
oh
oh
hum
well
doctor
said
henry
we
are
waiting
for
your
opinion
my
opinion
well
then
my
dear
boy
i
must
say
my
opinion
to
the
best
of
my
belief
is
that
i
really
don't
know
anything
about
it
then
perhaps
you'll
surrender
us
the
memorandum
said
charles
because
if
you
don't
know
anything
we
may
as
well
make
a
little
inquiry
ha
said
the
worthy
doctor
we
can't
put
old
heads
upon
young
shoulders
that's
quite
clear
now
my
good
young
men
be
patient
and
quiet
recollect
that
what
you
know
you're
acquainted
with
and
that
that
which
is
hidden
from
you
you
cannot
very
well
come
to
any
very
correct
conclusion
upon
there's
a
right
side
and
a
wrong
one
you
may
depend
to
every
question
and
he
who
walks
heedlessly
in
the
dark
is
very
apt
to
run
his
head
against
a
post
good
evening
my
boys--good
evening
away
bustled
the
doctor
well
said
charles
what
do
you
think
of
that
mr
henry
i
think
he
knows
what
he's
about
that
may
be
but
i'll
be
hanged
if
anybody
else
does
the
doctor
is
by
no
means
favourable
to
the
march
of
popular
information
and
i
really
think
he
might
have
given
us
some
food
for
reflection
instead
of
leaving
us
so
utterly
and
entirely
at
fault
as
he
has
and
you
know
he's
taken
away
your
memorandum
even
let
him
have
it
charles--let
him
have
it
it
is
safe
with
him
the
old
man
may
be
and
i
believe
is
a
little
whimsical
and
crotchety
but
he
means
abundantly
well
and
he's
just
one
of
those
sort
of
persons
and
always
was
who
will
do
good
his
own
way
or
not
at
all
so
we
must
take
the
good
with
the
bad
in
those
cases
and
let
dr
chillingworth
do
as
he
pleases
i
cannot
say
it
is
nothing
to
me
although
those
words
were
rising
to
my
lips
because
you
know
henry
that
everything
which
concerns
you
or
yours
is
something
to
me
and
therefore
it
is
that
i
feel
extremely
anxious
for
the
solution
of
all
this
mystery
before
i
hear
the
sequel
of
that
which
varney
the
vampyre
has
so
strongly
made
me
a
confidant
of
i
will
at
all
events
make
an
effort
to
procure
his
permission
to
communicate
it
to
all
those
who
are
in
any
way
beneficially
interested
in
the
circumstances
should
he
refuse
me
that
permission
i
am
almost
inclined
myself
to
beg
him
to
withhold
his
confidence
nay
do
not
do
so
charles--do
not
do
that
i
implore
you
recollect
although
you
cannot
make
us
joint
recipients
with
you
in
your
knowledge
you
can
make
use
of
it
probably
to
our
advantage
in
saving
us
perchance
from
the
different
consequences
so
that
you
can
make
what
you
know
in
some
way
beneficial
to
us
although
not
in
every
way
there
is
reason
in
that
and
i
give
in
at
once
be
it
so
henry
i
will
wait
on
him
and
if
i
cannot
induce
him
to
change
his
determination
and
allow
me
to
tell
some
other
as
well
as
flora
i
must
give
in
and
take
the
thing
as
a
secret
although
i
shall
not
abandon
a
hope
even
after
he
has
told
me
all
he
has
to
tell
that
i
may
induce
him
to
permit
me
to
make
a
general
confidence
instead
of
the
partial
one
he
has
empowered
me
to
do
it
may
be
so
and
at
all
events
we
must
not
reject
a
proffered
good
because
it
is
not
quite
so
complete
as
it
might
be
you
are
right
i
will
keep
my
appointment
with
him
entertaining
the
most
sanguine
hope
that
our
troubles
and
disasters--i
say
our
because
i
consider
myself
quite
associated
in
thought
interest
and
feelings
with
your
family--may
soon
be
over
heaven
grant
it
may
be
so
for
your's
and
flora's
sake
but
i
feel
that
bannerworth
hall
will
never
again
be
the
place
it
was
to
us
i
should
prefer
that
we
sought
for
new
associations
which
i
have
no
doubt
we
may
find
and
that
among
us
we
get
up
some
other
home
that
would
be
happier
because
not
associated
with
so
many
sad
scenes
in
our
history
be
it
so
and
i
am
sure
that
the
admiral
would
gladly
give
way
to
such
an
arrangement
he
has
often
intimated
that
he
thought
bannerworth
hall
a
dull
place
consequently
although
he
pretends
to
have
purchased
it
of
you
i
think
he
will
be
very
glad
to
leave
it
illustration
be
it
so
then
if
it
should
really
happen
that
we
are
upon
the
eve
of
any
circumstances
that
will
really
tend
to
relieve
us
from
our
misery
and
embarrassments
we
will
seek
for
some
pleasanter
abode
than
the
hall
which
you
may
well
imagine
since
it
became
the
scene
of
that
dreadful
tragedy
that
left
us
fatherless
has
borne
but
a
distasteful
appearance
to
all
our
eyes
i
don't
wonder
at
that
and
am
only
surprised
that
after
such
a
thing
had
happened
any
of
you
liked
to
inhabit
the
place
we
did
not
like
but
our
poverty
forced
us
you
have
no
notion
of
the
difficulties
through
which
we
have
struggled
and
the
fact
that
we
had
a
home
rent
free
was
one
of
so
much
importance
to
us
that
had
it
been
surrounded
by
a
thousand
more
disagreeables
than
it
was
we
must
have
put
up
with
it
but
now
that
we
owe
so
much
to
the
generosity
of
your
uncle
i
suppose
we
can
afford
to
talk
of
what
we
like
and
of
what
we
don't
like
you
can
henry
and
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
if
you
do
not
always
afford
to
do
so
and
now
as
the
time
is
drawing
on
i
think
i
will
proceed
at
once
to
varney
for
it
is
better
to
be
soon
than
late
and
get
from
him
the
remainder
of
his
story





there
were
active
influences
at
work
to
prevent
sir
francis
varney
from
so
quickly
as
he
had
arranged
to
do
carrying
out
his
intention
of
making
charles
holland
acquainted
with
the
history
of
the
eventful
period
of
his
life
which
had
been
associated
with
marmaduke
bannerworth
one
would
have
scarcely
thought
it
possible
that
anything
now
would
have
prevented
varney
from
concluding
his
strange
narrative
but
that
he
was
prevented
will
appear
the
boy
who
had
been
promised
such
liberal
payment
by
the
hungarian
nobleman
for
betraying
the
place
of
varney's
concealment
we
have
already
stated
felt
bitterly
the
disappointment
of
not
being
met
according
to
promise
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
by
that
individual
it
not
only
deprived
him
of
the
half-crowns
which
already
in
imagination
he
had
laid
out
but
it
was
a
great
blow
to
his
own
importance
for
after
his
discovery
of
the
residence
of
the
vampyre
he
looked
upon
himself
as
quite
a
public
character
and
expected
great
applause
for
his
cleverness
but
when
the
hungarian
nobleman
came
not
all
these
dreams
began
to
vanish
into
thin
air
and
like
the
unsubstantial
fabric
of
a
vision
to
leave
no
trace
behind
them
he
got
dreadfully
aggravated
and
his
first
thought
was
to
go
to
varney
and
see
what
he
could
get
from
him
by
betraying
the
fact
that
some
one
was
actively
in
search
of
him
that
seemed
however
a
doubtful
good
and
perhaps
there
was
some
personal
dread
of
the
vampyre
mixed
up
with
the
rejection
of
this
proposition
but
reject
it
he
did
and
then
he
walked
moodily
into
the
town
without
any
fixed
resolution
of
what
he
should
do
all
that
he
thought
of
was
a
general
idea
that
he
should
like
to
create
some
mischief
if
possible--what
it
was
he
cared
not
so
long
as
it
made
a
disturbance
now
he
knew
well
that
the
most
troublesome
and
fidgetty
man
in
the
town
was
tobias
philpots
a
saddler
who
was
always
full
of
everybody's
business
but
his
own
and
ever
ready
to
hear
any
scandal
of
his
neighbours
i
have
a
good
mind
said
the
boy
to
go
to
old
philpots
and
tell
him
all
about
it
that
i
have
the
good
mind
soon
strengthened
itself
into
a
fixed
resolution
and
full
of
disdain
and
indignation
at
the
supposed
want
of
faith
of
the
hungarian
nobleman
he
paused
opposite
the
saddler's
door
could
he
but
for
a
moment
have
suspected
the
real
reason
why
the
appointment
had
not
been
kept
with
him
all
his
curiosity
would
have
been
doubly
aroused
and
he
would
have
followed
the
landlord
of
the
inn
and
his
associate
upon
the
track
of
the
second
vampyre
that
had
visited
the
town
but
of
this
he
knew
nothing
for
that
proceeding
had
been
conducted
with
amazing
quietness
and
the
fact
of
the
hungarian
nobleman
when
he
found
that
he
was
followed
taking
a
contrary
course
to
that
in
which
varney
was
concealed
prevented
the
boy
from
knowing
anything
of
his
movements
hence
the
thing
looked
to
him
like
a
piece
of
sheer
neglect
and
contemptuous
indifference
which
he
felt
bound
to
resent
he
did
not
pause
long
at
the
door
of
the
saddler's
but
after
a
few
moments
he
walked
boldly
in
and
said--
master
philpots
i
have
got
something
extraordinary
to
tell
you
and
you
may
give
me
what
you
like
for
telling
you
go
on
then
said
the
saddler
that's
just
the
price
i
always
likes
to
pay
for
everything
will
you
keep
it
secret
said
the
boy
of
course
i
will
when
did
you
ever
hear
of
me
telling
anything
to
a
single
individual
never
to
a
single
individual
but
i
have
heard
you
tell
things
to
the
whole
town
confound
your
impudence
get
out
of
my
shop
directly
oh
very
good
i
can
go
and
tell
old
mitchell
the
pork-butcher
no
i
say--stop
don't
tell
him
if
anybody
is
to
know
let
it
be
me
and
i'll
promise
you
i'll
keep
it
secret
very
good
said
the
boy
returning
you
shall
know
it
and
mind
you
have
promised
me
to
keep
it
secret
so
that
if
it
gets
known
you
know
it
cannot
be
any
fault
of
mine
the
fact
was
the
boy
was
anxious
it
should
be
known
only
that
in
case
some
consequences
might
arise
he
thought
he
would
quiet
his
own
conscience
by
getting
a
promise
of
secrecy
from
tobias
philpots
which
he
well
knew
that
individual
would
not
think
of
keeping
he
then
related
to
him
the
interview
he
had
had
with
the
hungarian
nobleman
at
the
inn
how
he
had
promised
a
number
of
half-crowns
but
a
very
small
instalment
of
which
he
had
received
all
this
master
philpots
cared
very
little
for
but
the
information
that
the
dreaded
varney
the
vampyre
was
concealed
so
close
to
the
town
was
a
matter
of
great
and
abounding
interest
and
at
that
part
of
the
story
he
suddenly
pricked
up
his
ears
amazingly
why
you
don't
mean
to
say
that
he
exclaimed
are
you
sure
it
was
he
yes
i
am
quite
certain
i
have
seen
i
him
more
than
once
it
was
sir
francis
varney
without
any
mistake
why
then
you
may
depend
he's
only
waiting
until
it's
very
dark
and
then
he
will
walk
into
somebody
and
suck
his
blood
here's
a
horrid
discovery
i
thought
we
had
had
enough
of
master
varney
and
that
he
would
hardly
show
himself
here
again
and
now
you
tell
me
he
is
not
ten
minutes'
walk
off
it's
a
fact
said
the
boy
i
saw
him
go
in
and
he
looks
thinner
and
more
horrid
than
ever
i
am
sure
he
wants
a
dollop
of
blood
from
somebody
i
shouldn't
wonder
now
there
is
mrs
philpots
you
know
sir
she's
rather
big
and
seems
most
ready
to
burst
always
i
shouldn't
wonder
if
the
vampyre
came
to
her
to-night
wouldn't
you
said
mrs
philpots
who
had
walked
into
the
shop
and
overheard
the
whole
conversation
wouldn't
you
really
i'll
vampyre
you
and
teach
you
to
make
these
remarks
about
respectable
married
women
you
young
wretch
take
that
will
you
she
gave
the
boy
such
a
box
on
the
ears
that
the
place
seemed
to
spin
round
with
him
as
soon
as
he
recovered
sufficiently
to
be
enabled
to
walk
he
made
his
way
from
the
shop
with
abundance
of
precipitation
much
regretting
that
he
had
troubled
himself
to
make
a
confidant
of
master
philpots
but
however
he
could
not
but
tell
himself
that
if
his
object
was
to
make
a
general
disturbance
through
the
whole
place
he
had
certainly
succeeded
in
doing
so
he
slunk
home
perhaps
with
a
feeling
that
he
might
be
called
upon
to
take
part
in
something
that
might
ensue
and
at
all
events
be
compelled
to
become
a
guide
to
the
place
of
sir
francis
varney's
retreat
in
which
case
for
all
he
knew
the
vampyre
might
by
some
more
than
mortal
means
discover
what
a
hand
he
had
had
in
the
matter
and
punish
him
accordingly
the
moment
he
hid
left
the
saddler's
mrs
philpots
after
using
some
bitter
reproaches
to
her
husband
for
not
at
once
sacrificing
the
boy
upon
the
spot
for
the
disrespectful
manner
in
which
he
had
spoken
of
her
hastily
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
the
saddler
although
it
was
a
full
hour
before
the
usual
time
began
putting
up
the
shutters
of
his
shop
why
my
dear
he
said
to
mrs
philpots
when
she
came
down
stairs
equipped
for
the
streets
why
my
dear
where
are
you
going
and
pray
sir
what
are
you
shutting
up
the
shop
for
at
this
time
of
the
evening
oh
why
the
fact
is
i
thought
i'd
just
go
to
the
rose
and
crown
and
mention
that
the
vampyre
was
so
near
at
hand
well
mr
philpots
and
in
that
case
there
can
be
no
harm
in
my
calling
upon
some
of
my
acquaintance
and
mentioning
it
likewise
why
i
don't
suppose
there
would
be
much
harm
only
remember
mrs
philpots
remember
if
you
please---
remember
what
to
tell
everybody
to
keep
it
secret
oh
of
course
i
will
and
mind
you
do
it
likewise
most
decidedly
the
shop
was
closed
mr
philpots
ran
off
to
the
rose
and
crown
and
mrs
philpots
with
as
much
expedition
as
she
could
purposed
making
the
grand
tour
of
all
her
female
acquaintance
in
the
town
just
to
tell
them
as
a
great
secret
that
the
vampyre
sir
francis
varney
as
he
called
himself
had
taken
refuge
at
the
house
that
was
to
let
down
the
lane
leading
to
higgs's
farm
but
by
no
means
she
said
let
it
go
no
further
because
it
is
a
very
wrong
thing
to
make
any
disturbance
and
you
will
understand
that
it's
quite
a
secret
she
was
listened
to
with
breathless
attention
as
may
well
be
supposed
and
it
was
a
singular
circumstance
that
at
every
house
she
left
some
other
lady
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
ran
out
to
make
the
circle
of
her
acquaintance
with
precisely
the
same
story
and
precisely
the
same
injunctions
to
secrecy
and
as
mr
philpots
pursued
an
extremely
similar
course
we
are
not
surprised
that
in
the
short
space
of
one
hour
the
news
should
have
spread
through
all
the
town
and
that
there
was
scarcely
a
child
old
enough
to
understand
what
was
being
talked
about
who
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
sir
francis
varney
was
to
be
found
at
the
empty
house
down
the
lane
it
was
an
unlucky
time
too
for
the
night
was
creeping
on
a
period
at
which
people's
apprehension
of
the
supernatural
becomes
each
moment
stronger
and
more
vivid--a
period
at
which
a
number
of
idlers
are
let
loose
for
different
employments
and
when
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
row
or
a
riot
presents
itself
in
pleasant
colours
to
those
who
have
nothing
to
lose
and
who
expect
under
the
cover
of
darkness
to
be
able
to
commit
outrages
they
would
be
afraid
to
think
of
in
the
daytime
when
recognition
would
be
more
easy
thus
was
it
that
sir
francis
varney's
position
although
he
knew
it
not
became
momentarily
one
of
extreme
peril
and
the
danger
he
was
about
to
run
was
certainly
greater
than
any
he
had
as
yet
experienced
had
charles
holland
but
known
what
was
going
on
he
would
undoubtedly
have
done
something
to
preserve
the
supposed
vampyre
from
the
mischief
that
threatened
him
but
the
time
had
not
arrived
when
he
had
promised
to
pay
him
a
second
visit
so
he
had
no
idea
of
anything
serious
having
occurred
perhaps
too
mr
and
mrs
philpots
scarcely
anticipated
creating
so
much
confusion
but
when
they
found
that
the
whole
place
was
in
an
uproar
and
that
a
tumultuous
assemblage
of
persons
called
aloud
for
vengeance
upon
varney
the
vampyre
they
made
their
way
home
again
in
no
small
fright
and
now
what
was
the
result
of
all
these
proceedings
will
be
best
known
by
our
introducing
the
reader
to
the
interior
of
the
house
in
which
varney
had
found
a
temporary
refuge
and
following
in
detail
his
proceedings
as
he
waited
for
the
arrival
of
charles
holland
the
hunt
for
varney--the
house-tops--the
miraculous
escape--the
last
place
of
refuge--the
cottage
illustration
on
the
tree
tops
the
moon
shines
brightly
and
the
long
shadows
are
shooting
its
rays
down
upon
the
waters
and
the
green
fields
appear
clothed
in
a
flood
of
silver
light
the
little
town
was
quiet
and
tranquil--nature
seemed
at
rest
the
old
mansion
in
which
sir
francis
varney
had
taken
refuge
stood
empty
and
solitary
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
not
associated
with
the
others
by
which
it
was
surrounded
it
was
gloomy
and
in
the
moonlight
it
reminded
one
of
things
long
gone
by
existences
that
had
once
been
but
now
no
longer
of
this
present
time--a
mere
memento
of
the
past
sir
francis
varney
reclined
upon
the
house-top
he
gazed
upon
the
sky
and
upon
the
earth
he
saw
the
calm
tranquillity
that
reigned
around
and
could
not
but
admire
what
he
saw
he
sighed
he
seemed
to
sigh
from
a
pleasure
he
felt
in
the
fact
of
his
security
he
could
repose
there
without
fear
and
breathe
the
balmy
air
that
fanned
his
cheek
certainly
he
muttered
things
might
have
been
worse
but
not
much
worse
however
they
might
have
been
much
better
the
ignorant
are
away--the
most
to
be
feared
because
they
have
no
guide
and
no
control
save
what
can
be
exerted
over
them
by
their
fears
and
their
passions
he
paused
to
look
again
over
the
scene
and
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
that
moonlight
as
it
was
was
many
miles
the
country
was
diversified
with
hill
and
dale
meadow
and
ploughed
land
the
open
fields
and
the
darker
woods
and
the
silvery
stream
that
ran
at
no
great
distance
all
presented
a
scene
that
was
well
calculated
to
warm
the
imagination
and
to
give
the
mind
that
charm
which
a
cultivated
understanding
is
capable
of
receiving
there
was
but
one
thing
wanted
to
make
such
a
scene
one
of
pure
happiness
and
that
was
all
absence
of
care
of
fears
for
the
future
and
the
wants
of
life
suddenly
there
was
a
slight
sound
that
came
from
the
town
it
was
very
slight
but
the
ears
of
sir
francis
varney
were
painfully
acute
of
late
the
least
sound
that
came
across
him
was
heard
in
a
moment
and
his
whole
visage
was
changed
to
one
of
listening
interest
the
sound
was
hushed
but
his
attention
was
not
lulled
for
he
had
been
placed
in
circumstances
that
made
all
his
vigilance
necessary
for
his
own
preservation
hence
it
was
what
another
would
have
passed
over
or
not
heard
at
all
he
both
heard
and
noticed
he
was
not
sure
of
the
nature
of
the
sound
it
was
so
slight
and
so
indistinct
there
it
was
again
some
persons
were
moving
about
in
the
town
the
sounds
that
came
upon
the
night
air
seemed
to
say
that
there
was
an
unusual
bustle
in
the
town
which
was
to
sir
francis
varney
ominous
in
the
extreme
what
could
people
in
such
a
quiet
retired
place
require
out
at
such
an
hour
at
night
it
must
be
something
very
unusual--something
that
must
excite
them
to
a
great
degree
and
sir
francis
began
to
feel
very
uneasy
they
surely
he
muttered
to
himself--they
surely
cannot
have
found
out
my
hiding
place
and
intend
to
hunt
me
from
it
the
blood-thirsty
hounds
they
are
never
satisfied
the
mischief
they
are
permitted
to
do
on
one
occasion
is
but
the
precursor
to
another
the
taste
has
caused
the
appetite
for
more
and
nothing
short
of
his
blood
can
satisfy
it
the
sounds
increased
and
the
noise
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
it
appeared
as
though
a
number
of
men
had
collected
together
and
were
coming
towards
him
yes
they
were
coming
down
the
lane
towards
the
deserted
mansion
where
he
was
for
once
in
his
life
sir
francis
varney
trembled
he
felt
sick
at
heart
though
no
man
was
less
likely
to
give
up
hope
and
to
despair
than
he
yet
this
sign
of
unrelenting
hatred
and
persecution
was
too
unequivocal
and
too
stern
not
to
produce
its
effect
upon
even
his
mind
for
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
they
were
coming
with
the
express
purpose
of
seeking
him
how
they
could
have
found
him
out
was
a
matter
he
could
not
imagine
the
bannerworths
could
not
have
betrayed
him--he
was
sure
of
that
and
yet
who
could
have
seen
him
so
cautious
and
so
careful
as
he
had
been
and
so
very
sparing
had
he
lived
because
he
would
not
give
the
slightest
cause
for
all
that
was
about
to
follow
he
hoped
to
have
hidden
himself
but
now
he
could
hear
the
tramp
of
men
distinctly
and
their
voices
came
now
on
the
night
air
though
it
was
in
a
subdued
tone
as
if
they
were
desirous
of
approaching
unheard
and
unseen
by
their
victim
sir
francis
varney
stirred
not
from
his
position
he
remained
silent
and
motionless
he
appeared
not
to
heed
what
was
going
on
perhaps
he
hoped
to
see
them
go
by--to
be
upon
some
false
scent
or
if
they
saw
no
signs
of
life
they
might
leave
the
place
and
go
elsewhere
hark
they
stop
at
the
house--they
go
not
by
they
seem
to
pause
and
then
a
thundering
knock
came
at
the
door
which
echoed
and
re-echoed
through
the
empty
and
deserted
house
on
the
top
of
which
sat
in
silent
expectation
the
almost
motionless
sir
francis
varney
the
redoubted
vampyre
the
knock
which
came
so
loud
and
so
hard
upon
the
door
caused
sir
francis
to
start
visibly
for
it
seemed
his
own
knell
then
as
if
the
mob
were
satisfied
with
their
knowledge
of
his
presence
and
of
their
victory
and
of
his
inability
to
escape
them
they
sent
up
a
loud
shout
that
filled
the
whole
neighbourhood
with
its
sound
it
seemed
to
come
from
below
and
around
the
house
it
rose
from
all
sides
and
that
told
sir
francis
varney
that
the
house
was
surrounded
and
all
escape
was
cut
off
there
was
no
chance
of
his
being
able
to
rush
through
such
a
multitude
of
men
as
that
which
now
encircled
him
with
the
calmest
despair
sir
francis
varney
lay
still
and
motionless
on
the
house-top
and
listened
to
the
sounds
that
proceeded
from
below
shout
after
shout
arose
on
the
still
calm
air
of
the
night
knock
after
knock
came
upon
the
stout
old
door
which
awakened
responsive
echoes
throughout
the
house
that
had
for
many
years
lain
dormant
and
which
now
seemed
disturbed
and
resounded
in
hollow
murmurs
to
the
voices
from
without
then
a
loud
voice
shouted
from
below
as
if
to
be
heard
by
any
one
who
might
be
within--
sir
francis
varney
the
vampyre
come
out
and
give
yourself
up
at
discretion
if
we
have
to
search
for
you
you
may
depend
it
will
be
to
punish
you
you
will
suffer
by
burning
come
out
and
give
yourself
up
there
was
a
pause
and
then
a
loud
shout
sir
francis
varney
paid
no
attention
to
this
summons
but
sat
motionless
on
the
house-top
where
he
could
hear
all
that
passed
below
in
the
crowd
he
will
not
come
out
said
one
ah
he's
much
too
cunning
to
be
caught
in
such
a
trap
why
he
knows
what
you
would
do
with
him
he
knows
you
would
stake
him
and
make
a
bonfire
about
him
so
he
has
no
taste
for
roasting
remarked
another
but
still
it's
no
use
hiding
we
have
too
many
hands
and
know
the
house
too
well
to
be
easily
baffled
that
may
be
and
although
he
don't
like
burning
yet
we
will
unearth
the
old
fox
somehow
or
other
we
have
discovered
his
haunt
at
last
and
certainly
we'll
have
him
out
how
shall
we
get
in
knock
in
the
door--break
open
the
door
the
front
door--that
is
the
best
because
it
leads
to
all
parts
of
the
house
and
we
can
secure
any
one
who
attempts
to
move
from
one
to
the
other
as
they
come
down
hurrah
shouted
several
men
in
the
crowd
hurrah
echoed
the
mob
with
one
accord
and
the
shout
rent
the
air
and
disturbed
the
quietude
and
serenity
that
scarce
five
minutes
before
reigned
through
the
place
then
as
if
actuated
by
one
spirit
they
all
set
to
work
to
force
the
door
in
it
was
strong
and
capable
of
great
defence
and
employed
them
with
some
labour
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
and
then
with
a
loud
crash
the
door
fell
in
hurrah
again
shouted
the
crowd
these
shouts
announced
the
fall
of
the
door
and
then
and
not
until
then
did
sir
francis
varney
stir
they
have
broken
in
the
door
he
muttered
well
if
die
i
must
i
will
sell
my
life
dearly
however
all
is
not
yet
lost
and
in
the
struggle
for
life
the
loss
is
not
so
much
felt
he
got
up
and
crept
towards
the
trap
that
led
into
the
house
or
out
of
it
as
the
occasion
might
require
the
vampyre
the
vampyre
shouted
a
man
who
stood
on
a
garden
wall
holding
on
by
the
arm
of
an
apple-tree
varney
the
vampyre
shouted
a
second
hurrah
boys
we
are
on
the
right
scent
now
for
a
hunt
hurrah
we
shall
have
him
now
they
rushed
in
a
tumultuous
riot
up
the
stone
steps
and
into
the
hall
it
was
a
large
spacious
place
with
a
grand
staircase
that
led
up
to
the
upper
floor
but
it
had
two
ends
and
then
terminated
in
a
gallery
it
could
not
be
defended
by
one
man
save
at
the
top
where
it
could
not
long
be
held
because
the
assailants
could
unite
and
throw
their
whole
weight
against
the
entrance
and
thus
storm
it
this
actually
happened
they
looked
up
and
seeing
nobody
they
rushed
up
some
by
one
stair
and
some
by
the
other
but
it
was
dark
there
were
but
few
of
the
moon's
rays
that
pierced
the
gloom
of
that
place
and
those
who
first
reached
the
place
which
we
have
named
were
seized
with
astonishment
staggered
and
fell
sir
francis
varney
had
met
them
he
stood
there
with
a
staff--something
he
had
found
about
the
house--not
quite
so
long
as
a
broom-handle
but
somewhat
thicker
and
heavier
being
made
of
stout
ash
this
formidable
weapon
sir
francis
varney
wielded
with
strength
and
resolution
he
was
a
tall
man
and
one
of
no
mean
activity
and
personal
strength
and
such
a
weapon
in
his
hands
was
one
of
a
most
fearful
character
and
for
the
occasion
much
better
than
his
sword
man
after
man
fell
beneath
the
fearful
brace
of
these
blows
for
though
they
could
not
see
sir
francis
yet
he
could
see
them
or
the
hall-lights
were
behind
them
at
the
time
while
he
stood
in
the
dark
and
took
advantage
of
this
to
deal
murderous
blows
upon
his
assailants
this
continued
for
some
minutes
till
they
gave
way
before
such
a
vigorous
defence
and
paused
on
neighbours
on
cried
one
will
you
be
beaten
off
by
one
man
rush
in
at
once
and
you
must
force
him
from
his
position--push
him
hard
and
he
must
give
way
ay
said
one
fellow
who
sat
upon
the
ground
rubbing
his
head
it's
all
very
well
to
say
push
him
hard
but
if
you
felt
the
weight
of
that
d----d
pole
on
your
head
you
wouldn't
be
in
such
a
blessed
hurry
however
true
that
might
be
there
was
but
little
attention
paid
to
it
and
a
determined
rush
was
made
at
the
entrance
to
the
gallery
and
they
found
that
it
was
unoccupied
and
that
was
explained
by
the
slamming
of
a
door
and
its
being
immediately
locked
upon
them
and
when
the
mob
came
to
the
door
they
found
they
had
to
break
their
way
through
another
door
this
did
not
take
long
in
effecting
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
they
had
broken
through
that
door
which
led
into
another
room
but
the
first
man
who
entered
it
fell
from
a
crashing
blow
on
the
head
from
the
ashen
staff
of
sir
francis
varney
who
hurried
and
fled
closely
pursued
until
he
came
to
another
door
through
which
he
dashed
here
he
endeavoured
to
make
a
stand
and
close
it
but
was
immediately
struck
and
grappled
with
but
he
threw
his
assailant
and
turned
and
fled
again
his
object
had
been
to
defend
each
inch
of
the
ground
as
long
as
he
was
able
but
he
found
they
came
too
close
upon
his
steps
and
prevented
his
turning
in
time
to
try
the
strength
of
his
staff
upon
the
foremost
he
dashed
up
the
first
staircase
with
surprising
rapidity
leaving
his
pursuers
behind
and
when
he
had
gained
the
first
landing
he
turned
upon
those
who
pursued
him
who
could
hardly
follow
him
two
abreast
down
with
the
vampyre
shouted
the
first
who
rushed
up
heedless
of
the
staff
down
with
a
fool
thundered
varney
as
he
struck
the
fellow
a
terrific
blow
which
covered
his
face
with
blood
and
he
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
his
companions
a
bitter
groan
and
execration
arose
from
them
below
and
again
they
shouted
and
rushed
up
headlong
down
with
the
vampyre
was
again
shouted
and
met
by
a
corresponding
but
deep
guttural
sound
of--
down
with
a
fool
and
sure
enough
the
first
again
came
to
the
earth
without
any
preparation
save
the
application
of
an
ashen
stick
to
his
skull
which
by-the-bye
no
means
aided
the
operation
of
thinking
several
more
shared
a
similar
fate
but
they
pressed
hard
and
sir
francis
was
compelled
to
give
ground
to
keep
them
at
the
necessary
length
from
him
as
they
rushed
on
regardless
of
his
blows
and
if
he
had
not
he
would
soon
have
been
engaged
in
a
personal
struggle
for
they
were
getting
too
close
for
him
to
use
the
staff
down
with
the
vampyre
was
the
renewed
cry
as
they
drove
him
from
spot
to
spot
until
he
reached
the
roof
of
the
house
and
then
he
ran
up
the
steps
to
the
loft
which
he
had
just
reached
when
they
came
up
to
the
bottom
varney
attempted
to
draw
the
ladder
up
but
four
or
five
stout
men
held
that
down
then
by
a
sudden
turn
as
they
were
getting
up
he
turned
it
over
threw
those
on
it
down
and
the
ladder
too
upon
the
heads
of
those
who
were
below
down
with
the
vampyre
shouted
the
mob
as
they
with
the
most
untiring
energy
set
the
ladder
or
steps
against
the
loft
and
as
many
as
could
held
it
while
others
rushed
up
to
attack
varney
with
all
the
ferocity
and
courage
of
so
many
bull
dogs
it
was
strange
but
the
more
they
were
baffled
the
more
enraged
and
determined
they
rushed
on
to
a
new
attack
with
greater
resolution
than
ever
on
this
occasion
however
they
were
met
with
a
new
kind
of
missile
for
sir
francis
had
either
collected
and
placed
there
for
the
occasion
or
they
had
been
left
there
for
years
a
number
of
old
bricks
which
lay
close
at
hand
these
he
took
one
by
one
and
deliberately
took
aim
at
them
and
flung
them
with
great
force
striking
down
every
one
they
hit
this
caused
them
to
recoil
the
bricks
caused
fearful
gashes
in
their
heads
and
the
wounds
were
serious
the
flesh
being
in
many
places
torn
completely
off
they
however
only
paused
for
one
man
said--
be
of
good
heart
comrades
we
can
do
as
he
does
he
has
furnished
us
with
weapons
and
we
can
thus
attack
him
in
two
ways
and
he
must
give
way
in
the
end
hurrah
down
with
the
vampyre
sounded
from
all
sides
and
the
shout
was
answered
by
a
corresponding
rush
it
was
true
sir
francis
had
furnished
them
with
weapons
to
attack
himself
for
they
could
throw
them
back
at
him
which
they
did
and
struck
him
a
severe
blow
on
the
head
and
it
covered
his
face
with
blood
in
a
moment
hurrah
shouted
the
assailants
another
such
a
blow
and
all
will
be
over
with
the
vampyre
he's
got--
press
him
sharp
now
cried
another
man
as
he
aimed
another
blow
with
a
brick
which
struck
varney
on
the
arm
causing
him
to
drop
the
brick
he
held
in
his
hand
he
staggered
back
apparently
in
great
pain
up
up
we
have
him
now
he
cannot
get
away
he's
hurt
we
have
him--we
have
him
and
up
they
went
with
all
the
rapidity
they
could
scramble
up
the
steps
but
this
had
given
varney
time
to
recover
himself
and
though
his
right
arm
was
almost
useless
yet
he
contrived
with
his
left
to
pitch
the
bricks
so
as
to
knock
over
the
first
three
or
four
when
seeing
that
he
could
not
maintain
his
position
to
advantage
he
rushed
to
the
outside
of
the
house
the
last
place
he
had
capable
of
defence
there
was
a
great
shout
by
those
outside
when
they
saw
him
come
out
and
stand
with
his
staff
and
those
who
came
first
got
first
served
for
the
blows
resounded
while
he
struck
them
and
sent
them
over
below
then
came
a
great
shout
from
within
and
without
and
then
a
desperate
rush
was
made
at
the
door
and
in
the
next
instant
varney
was
seen
flying
followed
by
his
pursuers
one
after
the
other
some
tumbling
over
the
tiles
to
the
imminent
hazard
of
their
necks
sir
francis
varney
rushed
along
with
a
speed
that
appeared
by
far
too
great
to
admit
of
being
safely
followed
and
yet
those
who
followed
appeared
infected
by
his
example
and
appeared
heedless
of
all
consequences
by
which
their
pursuit
might
be
attended
to
themselves
hurrah
shouted
the
mob
below
hurrah
answered
the
mob
on
the
tiles
then
over
several
housetops
might
be
seen
the
flying
figure
of
sir
francis
varney
pursued
by
different
men
at
a
pace
almost
equal
to
his
own
they
however
could
keep
up
the
same
speed
and
not
improve
upon
it
while
he
kept
the
advantage
he
first
obtained
in
the
start
then
suddenly
he
disappeared
it
seemed
to
the
spectators
below
that
he
had
dropped
through
a
house
and
they
immediately
surrounded
the
house
as
well
as
they
could
and
then
set
up
another
shout
this
took
place
several
times
and
as
often
was
the
miserable
man
hunted
from
his
place
of
refuge
only
to
seek
another
from
which
he
was
in
like
manner
hunted
by
those
who
thirsted
for
his
blood
on
one
occasion
they
drove
him
into
a
house
which
was
surrounded
save
at
one
point
which
had
a
long
room
or
building
in
it
that
ran
some
distance
out
and
about
twenty
feet
high
at
the
entrance
to
the
roof
of
this
place
or
leads
he
stood
and
defended
himself
for
some
moments
with
success
but
having
received
a
blow
himself
he
was
compelled
to
retire
while
the
mob
behind
forced
those
in
front
forward
faster
than
he
could
by
any
exertion
wield
the
staff
that
had
so
much
befriended
him
on
this
occasion
he
was
therefore
on
the
point
of
being
overwhelmed
by
numbers
when
he
fled
but
alas
there
was
no
escape
a
bare
coping
stone
and
rails
ran
round
the
top
of
that
there
was
not
much
time
for
hesitation
but
he
jumped
over
the
rails
and
looked
below
it
was
a
great
height
but
if
he
fell
and
hurt
himself
he
knew
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
bloodhounds
behind
him
who
would
do
anything
but
show
him
any
mercy
or
spare
him
a
single
pang
he
looked
round
and
beheld
his
pursuers
close
upon
him
and
one
was
so
close
to
him
that
he
seized
upon
his
arm
saying
as
he
shouted
to
his
companions--
hurrah
boys
i
have
him
with
an
execration
sir
francis
wielded
his
staff
with
such
force
that
he
struck
the
fellow
on
the
head
crushing
in
his
hat
as
if
it
had
been
only
so
much
paper
the
man
fell
but
a
blow
followed
from
some
one
else
which
caused
varney
to
relax
his
hold
and
finding
himself
falling
he
to
save
himself
sprang
away
the
rails
at
that
moment
were
crowded
with
men
who
leaned
over
to
ascertain
the
effect
of
the
leap
he'll
be
killed
said
one
he's
sure
to
be
smashed
said
another
i'll
lay
any
wager
he'll
break
a
limb
said
a
third
varney
came
to
the
earth--for
a
moment
he
lay
stunned
and
not
able
to
move
hand
or
foot
hurrah
shouted
the
mob
their
triumph
was
short
for
just
as
they
shouted
varney
arose
and
after
a
moment
or
two's
stagger
he
set
off
at
full
speed
which
produced
another
shout
from
the
mob
and
just
at
that
moment
a
body
of
his
pursuers
were
seen
scaling
the
walls
after
him
there
was
now
a
hunt
through
all
the
adjoining
fields--from
cover
after
cover
they
pursued
him
until
he
found
no
rest
from
the
hungry
wolves
that
beset
him
with
cries
resembling
beasts
of
prey
rather
than
any
human
multitude
sir
francis
heard
them
at
the
same
time
with
the
despair
of
a
man
who
is
struggling
for
life
and
yet
knows
he
is
struggling
in
vain
he
knew
his
strength
was
decaying--his
immense
exertions
and
the
blows
he
had
received
all
weakened
him
while
the
number
and
strength
of
his
foes
seemed
rather
to
increase
than
to
diminish
once
more
he
sought
the
houses
and
for
a
moment
he
believed
himself
safe
but
that
was
only
a
momentary
deception
for
they
had
traced
him
he
arrived
at
a
garden
wall
over
which
he
bounded
and
then
he
rushed
into
the
house
the
door
of
which
stood
open
for
the
noise
and
disturbance
had
awakened
most
of
the
inhabitants
who
were
out
in
all
directions
he
took
refuge
in
a
small
closet
on
the
stairs
but
was
seen
to
do
so
by
a
girl
who
screamed
out
with
fear
and
fright
murder
murder--the
wampyre--the
wampyre
with
all
her
strength
and
in
the
way
of
screaming
that
was
no
little
and
then
she
went
off
into
a
fit
this
was
signal
enough
and
the
house
was
at
once
entered
and
beset
on
all
sides
by
the
mob
who
came
impatient
of
obtaining
their
victim
who
had
so
often
baffled
them
there
he
is--there
he
is
said
the
girl
who
came
to
as
soon
as
other
people
came
up
where--where
in
that
closet
she
said
pointing
to
it
with
her
finger
i
see'd
him
go
in
the
way
above
sir
francis
finding
himself
betrayed
immediately
came
out
of
the
closet
just
as
two
or
three
were
advancing
to
open
it
and
dealt
so
hard
a
blow
on
the
head
of
the
first
that
came
near
him
that
he
fell
without
a
groan
and
a
second
shared
the
same
fate
and
then
sir
francis
found
himself
grappled
with
but
with
a
violent
effort
he
relieved
himself
and
rushed
up
stairs
oh
murder--the
wampyre
what
shall
i
do--fire--fire
these
exclamations
were
uttered
in
consequence
of
varney
in
his
haste
to
get
up
stairs
having
inadvertently
stepped
into
the
girl's
lap
with
one
foot
while
he
kicked
her
in
the
chin
with
the
other
besides
scratching
her
nose
till
it
bled
after
him--stick
to
him
shouted
the
mob
but
the
girl
kicked
and
sprawled
so
much
they
were
impeded
till
regardless
of
her
cries
they
ran
over
her
and
pursued
varney
who
was
much
distressed
with
the
exertions
he
had
made
after
about
a
minute's
race
he
turned
upon
the
head
of
the
stair
not
so
much
with
the
hope
of
defending
it
as
of
taking
some
breathing
time
but
seeing
his
enemies
so
close
he
drew
his
sword
and
stood
panting
but
prepared
never
mind
his
toasting-fork
said
one
bulky
fellow
and
as
he
spoke
he
rushed
on
but
the
point
of
the
weapon
entered
his
heart
and
he
fell
dead
there
was
a
dreadful
execration
uttered
by
those
who
came
up
after
him
and
there
was
a
momentary
pause
for
none
liked
to
rush
on
to
the
bloody
sword
of
sir
francis
varney
who
stood
so
willing
and
so
capable
of
using
it
with
the
most
deadly
effect
they
paused
as
well
they
might
and
this
pause
was
the
most
welcome
thing
next
to
life
to
the
unfortunate
fugitive
for
he
was
dreadfully
distressed
and
bleeding
on
to
him
boys
he
can
hardly
stand
see
how
he
pants
on
to
him
i
say--push
him
hard
he
pushes
hard
i
tell
you
said
another
i
felt
the
point
of
his
sword
as
it
came
through
giles's
back
i'll
try
my
luck
then
said
another
and
he
rushed
up
but
he
was
met
by
the
sword
of
sir
francis
who
pierced
it
through
his
side
and
he
fell
back
with
a
groan
sir
francis
fearful
of
stopping
any
longer
to
defend
that
point
appeared
desirous
of
making
good
his
retreat
with
some
little
advantage
and
he
rushed
up
stairs
before
they
had
recovered
from
the
momentary
consternation
into
which
they
had
been
thrown
by
the
sudden
disaster
they
had
received
illustration
but
they
were
quickly
after
him
and
before
he
wearied
as
he
was
could
gain
the
roof
they
were
up
the
ladder
after
him
the
first
man
who
came
through
the
trap
was
again
set
upon
by
varney
who
made
a
desperate
thrust
at
him
and
it
took
effect
but
the
sword
snapped
by
the
handle
with
an
execration
sir
francis
threw
the
hilt
at
the
head
of
the
next
man
he
saw
then
rushing
with
headlong
speed
he
distanced
his
pursuers
for
some
house
tops
but
the
row
of
houses
ended
at
the
one
he
was
then
at
and
he
could
go
no
further
what
was
to
be
done
the
height
was
by
far
too
great
to
be
jumped
death
was
certain
a
hideous
heap
of
crushed
and
mangled
bones
would
be
the
extent
of
what
would
remain
of
him
and
then
perhaps
life
not
extinct
for
some
hours
afterwards
he
turned
round
he
saw
them
coming
hallooing
over
the
house
tops
like
a
pack
of
hounds
sir
francis
struck
his
hands
together
and
groaned
he
looked
round
and
perceived
some
ivy
peeping
over
the
coping-stone
a
thought
struck
him
and
he
instantly
ran
to
the
spot
and
leaned
over
saved--saved
he
exclaimed
then
placing
his
hand
over
he
felt
for
the
ivy
then
he
got
over
and
hung
by
the
coping-stone
in
a
perilous
position
till
he
found
a
spot
on
which
he
could
rest
his
foot
and
then
he
grasped
the
ivy
as
low
down
as
he
could
and
thus
he
lowered
himself
a
short
way
till
he
came
to
where
the
ivy
was
stronger
and
more
secure
to
the
wall
as
the
upper
part
was
very
dangerous
with
his
weight
attached
to
it
the
mob
came
on
very
sure
of
having
sir
francis
varney
in
their
power
and
they
did
not
hurry
on
so
violently
as
their
position
was
dangerous
at
that
hour
of
the
night
easy
boys
easy
was
the
cry
the
bird
is
our
own
he
can't
get
away
that's
very
certain
they
however
came
on
and
took
no
time
about
it
hardly
but
what
was
their
amazement
and
rage
at
finding
he
had
disappeared
where
is
he
was
the
universal
inquiry
and
i
don't
know
an
almost
universal
answer
there
was
a
long
pause
while
they
searched
around
but
they
saw
no
vestige
of
the
object
of
their
search
there's
no
trap
door
open
remarked
one
and
i
don't
think
he
could
have
got
in
at
any
one
perhaps
finding
he
could
not
get
away
he
has
taken
the
desperate
expedient
of
jumping
over
and
committing
suicide
and
so
escape
the
doom
he
ought
to
be
subjected
to
probably
he
has
but
then
we
can
run
a
stake
through
him
and
burn
him
all
the
same
they
now
approached
the
extreme
verge
of
the
houses
and
looked
over
the
sides
but
they
could
see
nothing
the
moon
was
up
and
there
was
light
enough
to
have
seen
him
if
he
had
fallen
to
the
earth
and
they
were
quite
sure
that
he
could
not
have
got
up
after
such
a
fall
as
he
must
have
received
we
are
beaten
after
all
neighbours
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
was
the
reply
he
may
now
be
hidden
about
for
he
was
too
far
spent
to
be
able
to
go
far
he
could
not
do
that
i
am
sure
i
think
not
either
might
he
not
have
escaped
by
means
of
that
ivy
yonder
said
one
of
the
men
pointing
to
the
plant
as
it
climbed
over
the
coping-stones
of
the
wall
yes
it
may
be
possible
said
one
and
yet
it
is
very
dangerous
if
not
certain
destruction
to
get
over
oh
yes
there
is
no
possibility
of
escape
that
way
why
it
wouldn't
bear
a
cat
for
there
are
no
nails
driven
into
the
wall
at
this
height
never
mind
said
another
we
may
as
well
leave
no
stone
unturned
as
the
saying
is
but
at
once
set
about
looking
out
for
him
the
individual
who
spoke
now
leant
over
the
coping
stone
for
some
moments
in
silence
he
could
see
nothing
but
yet
he
continued
to
gaze
for
some
moments
do
you
see
him
inquired
one
no
was
the
answer
ay
ay
i
thought
as
much
was
the
reply
he
might
as
well
have
got
hold
of
a
corner
of
the
moon
which
i
believe
is
more
likely--a
great
deal
more
likely
hold
still
a
moment
said
the
man
who
was
looking
over
the
edge
of
the
house
what's
the
matter
now
a
gnat
flew
into
your
eye
no
but
i
see
him--by
jove
i
see
him
see
who--see
who
varney
the
vampyre
shouted
the
man
i
see
him
about
half-way
down
clinging
like
a
fly
to
the
wall
odd
zounds
i
never
saw
the
like
afore
hurrah
after
him
then
boys
not
the
same
way
if
you
please
go
yourself
and
welcome
but
i
won't
go
that
way
just
as
you
please
said
the
man
but
what's
good
for
the
goose
is
good
for
the
gander
is
an
old
saying
and
so
is
jack
as
good
as
his
master
so
it
may
be
but
cuss
me
if
you
ain't
a
fool
if
you
attempt
that
the
man
made
no
reply
but
did
as
varney
had
done
before
got
over
the
coping
stone
and
then
laid
hold
of
the
ivy
but
whether
his
weight
was
heavier
than
varney's
or
whether
it
was
that
the
latter
had
loosened
the
hold
of
the
ivy
or
not
but
he
had
no
sooner
left
go
of
the
coping
stone
than
the
ivy
gave
way
and
he
was
precipitated
from
the
height
of
about
fifty
feet
to
the
earth--a
dreadful
fall
there
was
a
pause--no
one
spoke
the
man
lay
motionless
and
dead--he
had
dislocated
his
neck
the
fall
had
not
however
been
without
its
effect
upon
varney
for
the
man's
heels
struck
him
so
forcibly
on
his
head
as
he
fell
that
he
was
stunned
and
let
go
his
hold
and
he
too
fell
to
the
earth
but
not
many
feet
he
soon
recovered
himself
and
was
staggering
away
when
he
was
assailed
by
those
above
with
groans
and
curses
of
all
kinds
and
then
by
stones
and
tiles
and
whatever
the
mob
could
lay
their
hands
upon
some
of
these
struck
him
and
he
was
cut
about
in
various
places
so
that
he
could
hardly
stand
the
hoots
and
shouts
of
the
mob
above
had
now
attracted
those
below
to
the
spot
where
sir
francis
varney
was
trying
to
escape
but
he
had
not
gone
far
before
the
loud
yells
of
those
behind
him
told
him
that
he
was
again
pursued
half
dead
and
almost
wholly
spent
unarmed
and
defenceless
he
scarce
knew
what
to
do
whether
to
fly
or
to
turn
round
and
die
as
a
refuge
from
the
greater
evil
of
endeavouring
to
prolong
a
struggle
which
seemed
hopeless
instinct
however
urged
him
on
at
all
risks
and
though
he
could
not
go
very
far
or
fast
yet
on
he
went
with
the
crowd
after
him
down
with
the
vampyre--seize
him--hold
him--burn
him
he
must
be
down
presently
he
can't
stand
this
gave
them
new
hopes
and
rendered
varney's
fate
almost
certain
they
renewed
their
exertions
to
overtake
him
while
he
exerted
himself
anew
and
with
surprising
agility
considering
how
he
had
been
employed
for
more
than
two
hours
there
were
some
trees
and
hedges
now
that
opposed
the
progress
of
both
parties
the
height
of
sir
francis
varney
gave
him
a
great
advantage
and
had
he
been
fresh
he
might
have
shown
it
to
advantage
in
vaulting
over
the
hedges
and
ditches
which
he
jumped
when
obliged
and
walked
through
when
he
could
every
now
and
then
the
party
in
pursuit
who
had
been
behind
him
some
distance
now
they
gained
on
him
however
they
kept
every
now
and
then
losing
sight
of
him
among
the
trees
and
shrubs
and
he
made
direct
for
a
small
wood
hoping
that
when
there
he
should
to
be
able
to
conceal
himself
for
some
time
so
as
to
throw
his
pursuers
off
the
track
they
were
well
aware
of
this
for
they
increased
their
speed
and
one
or
two
swifter
of
foot
than
the
others
got
a-head
of
them
and
cried
out
aloud
as
they
ran--
keep
up
keep
up
he's
making
for
the
wood
he
can't
stop
there
long
there
are
too
many
of
us
to
beat
that
cover
without
finding
our
game
push
lads
he's
our
own
now
as
sure
as
we
know
he's
on
a-head
they
did
push
on
and
came
in
full
sight
as
they
saw
sir
francis
enter
the
wood
with
what
speed
he
could
make
but
he
was
almost
spent
this
was
a
cheering
sight
to
them
and
they
were
pretty
certain
he
would
not
leave
the
wood
in
the
state
he
was
then--he
must
seek
concealment
however
they
were
mistaken
for
sir
francis
varney
as
soon
as
he
got
into
the
wood
plunged
into
the
thickest
of
it
and
then
paused
to
gain
breath
so
far
safe
he
muttered
but
i
have
had
a
narrow
escape
they
are
not
yet
done
though
and
it
will
not
be
safe
here
long
i
must
away
and
seek
shelter
and
safety
elsewhere
if
i
can--curses
on
the
hounds
that
run
yelping
over
the
fields
he
heard
the
shouts
of
his
pursuers
and
prepared
to
quit
the
wood
when
he
thought
the
first
had
entered
it
they
will
remain
here
some
time
in
beating
about
he
muttered
that
is
the
only
chance
i
have
had
since
the
pursuit
curse
them
i
say
again
i
may
now
get
free
this
delay
must
save
my
life
but
nothing
else
will
he
moved
away
and
at
a
slow
and
lazy
pace
left
the
wood
and
then
made
his
way
across
some
fields
towards
some
cottages
that
lay
on
the
left
the
moon
yet
shone
on
the
fields
he
could
hear
the
shouts
of
the
mob
as
various
parties
went
through
the
wood
from
one
covert
to
another
and
yet
unable
to
find
him
then
came
a
great
shout
upon
his
ears
as
though
they
had
found
out
he
had
left
the
wood
this
caused
him
to
redouble
his
speed
and
fearful
lest
he
should
be
seen
in
the
moonlight
he
leaped
over
the
first
fence
that
he
came
to
with
almost
the
last
effort
he
could
make
and
then
staggered
in
at
an
open
door--through
a
passage--into
a
front
parlour
and
there
fell
faint
and
utterly
spent
and
speechless
at
the
feet
of
flora
bannerworth
the
reception
of
the
vampyre
by
flora--varney
subdued
illustration
we
must
say
that
the
irruption
into
the
house
of
the
bannerworths
by
sir
francis
varney
was
certainly
unpremeditated
by
him
for
he
knew
not
into
whose
house
he
had
thus
suddenly
rushed
for
refuge
from
the
numerous
foes
who
were
pursuing
him
with
such
vengeful
ire
it
was
a
strange
and
singular
incident
and
one
well
calculated
to
cause
the
mind
to
pause
before
it
passed
it
by
and
consider
the
means
to
an
end
which
are
sometimes
as
wide
of
the
mark
as
it
is
in
nature
possible
to
be
but
truth
is
stronger
than
fiction
by
far
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
pressed
on
all
sides
by
danger
bleeding
faint
and
exhausted
he
rushed
into
the
first
house
he
came
to
and
thus
placed
himself
in
the
very
house
of
those
whom
he
had
brought
to
such
a
state
of
misfortune
flora
bannerworth
was
seated
at
some
embroidery
to
pass
away
an
hour
or
so
and
thus
get
over
the
tedium
of
time
she
was
not
thinking
either
upon
the
unhappy
past
some
trifling
object
or
other
engaged
her
attention
but
what
was
her
anguish
when
she
saw
a
man
staggering
into
the
room
bleeding
and
bearing
the
marks
of
a
bloody
contest
and
sinking
at
her
feet
her
astonishment
was
far
greater
yet
when
she
recognised
that
man
to
be
sir
francis
varney
save
me--save
me
miss
bannerworth
save
me--only
you
can
save
me
from
the
ruthless
multitude
which
follows
crying
aloud
for
my
blood
as
he
spoke
he
sank
down
speechless
flora
was
so
much
amazed
not
to
say
terrified
that
she
knew
not
what
to
do
she
saw
sir
francis
a
suppliant
at
her
feet
a
fugitive
from
his
enemies
who
would
show
him
no
mercy--she
saw
all
this
at
a
moment's
glance
and
yet
she
had
not
recovered
her
speech
and
presence
of
mind
enough
to
enable
her
to
make
any
reply
to
him
save
me
miss
flora
bannerworth
save
me
he
again
said
raising
himself
on
his
hands
i
am
beset
hunted
like
a
wild
beast--they
seek
my
life--they
have
pursued
me
from
one
spot
to
another
and
i
have
unwittingly
intruded
upon
you
you
will
save
me
i
am
sure
your
kindness
and
goodness
of
heart
will
never
permit
me
to
be
turned
out
among
such
a
crew
of
blood-thirsty
butchers
as
those
who
pursue
me
are
rise
sir
francis
varney
said
flora
after
a
moment's
hesitation
in
such
an
extremity
as
that
which
you
are
in
it
would
be
inhuman
indeed
to
thrust
you
out
among
your
enemies
oh
it
would
said
varney
i
had
thought
until
now
i
could
have
faced
such
a
mob
until
i
was
in
this
extremity
and
then
disarmed
and
thrown
down
bruised
beaten
and
incapable
of
stemming
such
a
torrent
i
fled
from
one
place
to
another
till
hunted
from
each
and
then
instinct
alone
urged
me
to
greater
exertion
than
before
and
here
i
am--this
is
now
my
last
and
only
hope
rise
sir
francis
you
will
not
let
me
be
torn
out
and
slaughtered
like
an
ox
i
am
sure
you
will
not
sir
francis
we
are
incapable
of
such
conduct
you
have
sought
refuge
here
and
shall
find
it
as
far
as
we
are
able
to
afford
it
to
you
and
your
brother--and--
yes--yes--all
who
are
here
will
do
the
same
but
here
they
come
to
speak
for
themselves
as
she
spoke
mrs
bannerworth
entered
also
charles
holland
who
both
started
on
seeing
the
vampyre
present
sir
francis
varney
who
was
too
weak
to
rise
without
assistance
sir
francis
varney
said
flora
speaking
to
them
as
they
entered
has
sought
refuge
here
his
life
is
in
peril
and
he
has
no
other
hope
left
you
will
i
am
sure
do
what
can
be
done
for
him
mr
holland
said
sir
francis
i
am
as
you
may
see
by
my
condition
a
fugitive
and
have
been
beaten
almost
to
death
instinct
alone
urged
me
on
to
save
my
life
and
i
unknowingly
came
in
here
rise
sir
francis
said
charles
holland
i
am
not
one
who
would
feel
any
pleasure
in
seeing
you
become
the
victim
of
any
brutal
mob
i
am
sure
there
are
none
amongst
us
who
would
willingly
do
so
you
have
trusted
to
those
who
will
not
betray
you
thank
you
said
sir
francis
faintly
i
thank
you
your
conduct
is
noble
and
miss
bannerworth's
especially
so
are
you
much
hurt
sir
francis
inquired
charles
i
am
much
hurt
but
not
seriously
or
dangerously
but
i
am
weak
and
exhausted
let
me
assist
you
to
rise
said
charles
holland
thank
you
said
sir
francis
as
he
accepted
of
the
assistance
and
when
he
stood
up
he
found
how
incapable
he
really
was
for
a
child
might
have
grappled
with
him
i
have
been
sore
beset
mrs
bannerworth
he
said
endeavouring
to
bow
to
that
lady
and
i
have
suffered
much
ill-usage
i
am
not
in
such
a
plight
as
i
could
wish
to
be
seen
in
by
ladies
but
my
reasons
for
coming
will
be
an
excuse
for
my
appearance
in
such
disorder
we
will
not
say
anything
about
that
said
charles
holland
under
the
circumstances
it
could
not
be
otherwise
it
could
not
said
sir
francis
as
he
took
the
chair
miss
flora
bannerworth
placed
for
him
i
will
not
ask
you
for
any
explanation
as
to
how
this
came
about
but
you
need
some
restorative
and
rest
i
think
i
suffer
more
from
exhaustion
than
anything
else
the
bruises
i
have
of
course
are
not
dangerous
can
you
step
aside
a
few
moments
said
mrs
bannerworth
i
will
show
you
where
you
can
remove
some
of
those
stains
and
make
yourself
more
comfortable
thank
you
madam--thank
you
it
will
be
most
welcome
to
me
i
assure
you
sir
francis
rose
up
and
with
the
aid
of
charles
holland
he
walked
to
the
next
room
where
he
washed
himself
and
arranged
his
dress
as
well
as
it
would
admit
of
its
being
done
mr
holland
he
said
i
cannot
tell
you
how
grateful
i
feel
for
this
i
have
been
hunted
from
the
house
where
you
saw
me
from
what
source
they
learned
my
abode--my
place
of
concealment--i
know
not
but
they
found
me
out
i
need
hardly
say
sir
francis
that
it
could
not
have
occurred
through
me
said
charles
holland
my
young
friend
said
sir
francis
i
am
quite
sure
you
were
not
and
moreover
i
never
for
one
moment
suspected
you
no
no
some
accidental
circumstance
alone
has
been
the
cause
i
have
been
very
cautious--i
may
say
extremely
so--but
at
the
same
time
living
as
i
have
surrounded
by
enemies
on
all
sides
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
i
should
be
seen
by
some
one
and
thus
traced
to
my
lair
whither
they
followed
me
at
their
leisure
they
have
been
but
too
troublesome
in
this
matter
when
they
become
a
little
reasonable
it
will
be
a
great
miracle
for
when
their
passions
and
fears
are
excited
there
is
no
end
to
the
extremes
they
will
perpetrate
it
is
so
said
varney
as
the
history
of
these
last
few
days
amply
testifies
to
me
i
could
never
have
credited
the
extent
to
which
popular
excitement
could
be
carried
and
the
results
it
was
likely
to
produce
it
is
an
engine
of
very
difficult
control
pursued
charles
holland
but
what
will
raise
it
will
not
allay
it
but
add
fuel
to
the
fire
that
burns
so
fiercely
already
true
enough
said
sir
francis
if
you
have
done
will
you
again
step
this
way
sir
francis
varney
followed
charles
holland
into
the
sitting-room
and
sat
down
with
them
and
before
him
was
spread
a
light
supper
with
some
good
wine
eat
sir
francis
said
mrs
bannerworth
such
a
state
as
that
in
which
you
are
must
of
necessity
produce
great
exhaustion
and
you
must
require
food
and
drink
sir
francis
bowed
as
well
as
he
was
able
and
even
then
sore
and
bruised
as
he
was
fugitive
as
he
had
been
he
could
not
forget
his
courtesy
but
it
was
not
without
an
effort
his
equanimity
was
however
much
disturbed
by
finding
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
bannerworths
i
owe
you
a
relation
he
said
of
what
occurred
to
drive
me
from
my
place
of
concealment
we
should
like
to
hear
it
if
you
are
not
too
far
fatigued
to
relate
it
said
charles
i
will
i
was
sitting
at
the
top
of
that
house
in
which
i
sought
to
hide
myself
when
i
heard
sounds
come
that
were
of
a
very
suspicious
nature
but
did
not
believe
that
it
could
happen
that
they
had
discovered
my
lurking-place
far
from
it
though
of
late
i
had
been
habitually
cautious
and
suspicious
yet
i
thought
i
was
safe
till
i
heard
the
noise
of
a
multitude
coming
towards
me
i
could
not
be
mistaken
in
it
for
the
sounds
are
so
peculiar
that
they
are
like
nothing
else
i
heard
them
coming
i
moved
not
and
when
they
surrounded
the
house
as
far
as
was
practicable
they
gave
an
immense
shout
and
made
the
welkin
ring
with
the
sound
i
heard
a
confused
noise
at
a
distance
remarked
flora
but
i
had
no
idea
that
anything
serious
was
contemplated
i
imagined
it
was
some
festival
among
some
trade
or
portion
of
the
townspeople
who
were
shouting
from
joy
oh
dear
no
said
sir
francis
but
i
am
not
surprised
at
the
mistake
because
there
are
such
occurrences
occasionally
but
whenever
the
mob
gained
any
advantage
upon
me
they
shouted
and
when
i
was
able
to
oppose
them
with
effect
they
groaned
at
me
most
horribly
the
deuce
said
charles
the
sound
suppose
serves
to
express
their
feelings
and
to
encourage
each
other
something
of
the
sort
i
dare
say
said
varney
but
at
length
after
defending
the
house
with
all
the
desperation
that
despair
imparted
to
me
i
was
compelled
to
fly
from
floor
to
floor
until
i
had
reached
the
roof
there
they
followed
me
and
i
was
compelled
again
to
fly
house
after
house
they
followed
me
to
until
i
could
go
no
farther
said
varney
how
did
you
escape
fortunately
i
saw
some
ivy
growing
and
creeping
over
the
coping-stones
and
by
grasping
that
i
got
over
the
side
and
so
let
myself
down
by
degrees
as
well
as
i
was
able
good
heavens
what
a
dreadful
situation
exclaimed
flora
it
is
really
horrible
i
could
not
do
it
again
under
i
think
any
circumstances
not
the
same
said
mrs
bannerworth
i
really
doubt
if
i
could
said
varney
the
truth
is
the
excitement
of
the
moment
was
great
and
i
at
that
moment
thought
of
nothing
but
getting
away
the
same
circumstances
the
same
fear
of
death
could
hardly
be
produced
in
me
again
and
i
am
unable
to
account
for
the
phenomenon
on
this
occasion
your
escape
was
very
narrow
indeed
said
flora
it
makes
me
shudder
to
think
of
the
dangers
you
have
gone
through
it
is
really
terrible
to
think
of
it
you
said
sir
francis
are
young
and
susceptible
and
generous
in
your
disposition
you
can
feel
for
me
and
do
but
how
little
i
could
have
expected
it
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
your
sympathy
sinks
into
my
mind
and
causes
such
emotions
as
never
can
be
erased
from
my
soul
but
to
proceed
you
may
guess
how
dreadful
was
my
position
by
the
fact
that
the
first
man
who
attempted
to
get
over
tore
the
ivy
away
and
fell
striking
me
in
his
fall
he
was
killed
and
i
thrown
down
and
stunned
i
then
made
for
the
wood
closely
pursued
and
got
into
it
then
i
baffled
them
they
searched
the
wood
and
i
went
through
it
i
then
ran
across
the
country
to
these
houses
here
i
got
over
the
fence
and
in
at
the
back
door
did
they
see
you
come
inquired
charles
holland
i
cannot
say
but
i
think
that
they
did
not
i
heard
them
give
a
loud
shout
more
than
once
when
on
this
side
of
the
wood
you
did
how
far
from
here
were
you
when
you
heard
the
shouts
inquired
mrs
bannerworth
i
was
close
here
and
as
i
jumped
over
the
fence
i
heard
them
shout
again
but
i
think
they
cannot
see
so
far
the
night
was
moonlight
to
be
sure
but
that
is
all
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
and
the
distance
together
would
make
it
if
not
impossible
at
least
very
improbable
that
is
very
likely
said
mrs
bannerworth
in
that
case
said
charles
holland
you
are
safe
here
for
none
will
suspect
your
being
concealed
here
it
is
the
last
place
i
should
myself
have
thought
of
said
varney
and
i
may
say
the
last
place
i
would
knowingly
have
come
to
but
had
i
before
known
enough
of
you
i
should
have
been
well
assured
of
your
generosity
and
have
freely
come
to
claim
your
aid
and
shelter
which
accident
has
so
strangely
brought
me
to
be
a
candidate
for
and
which
you
have
so
kindly
awarded
me
the
night
is
wearing
away
said
flora
and
sir
francis
is
doubtless
fatigued
to
an
excess
sleep
i
dare
say
will
be
most
welcome
to
him
it
will
indeed
miss
bannerworth
said
varney
but
i
can
do
that
under
any
circumstances
do
not
let
me
put
you
to
any
inconvenience
a
chair
and
at
any
hour
will
serve
me
for
sleep
we
cannot
do
for
you
what
we
would
wish
said
flora
looking
at
her
mother
but
something
better
than
that
at
all
events
we
can
and
will
provide
for
you
i
know
not
how
to
thank
you
said
sir
francis
varney
i
assure
you
of
late
i
have
not
been
luxuriously
lodged
and
the
less
trouble
i
give
you
the
greater
i
shall
esteem
the
favour
the
hour
was
late
and
sir
francis
varney
before
another
half
hour
had
elapsed
was
consigned
to
his
own
reflections
in
a
small
but
neat
room
there
to
repose
his
bruised
and
battered
carcass
and
court
the
refreshing
influence
of
sleep
his
reflections
were
for
nearly
an
hour
of
the
most
contradictory
character
some
one
passion
was
trying
to
overcome
the
other
but
he
seemed
quite
subdued
i
could
not
have
expected
this
he
muttered
flora
bannerworth
has
the
soul
of
a
heroine
i
deserved
not
such
a
reception
from
them
and
yet
in
my
hour
of
utmost
need
they
have
received
me
like
a
favoured
friend
and
yet
all
their
misfortunes
have
taken
their
origin
from
me
i
am
the
cause
of
all
filled
with
these
thoughts
he
fell
asleep
he
slept
till
morning
broke
he
was
not
disturbed
it
seemed
as
though
the
influence
of
sleep
was
sweeter
far
there
in
the
cottage
of
the
bannerworths
than
ever
he
had
before
received
it
was
late
on
that
morning
before
sir
francis
rose
and
then
only
through
hearing
the
family
about
and
having
performed
his
toilet
so
far
as
circumstances
permitted
he
descended
and
entered
the
front-parlour
the
room
he
had
been
in
the
night
before
flora
bannerworth
was
already
there
indeed
breakfast
was
waiting
the
appearance
of
sir
francis
varney
good
morning
miss
bannerworth
said
sir
francis
bowing
with
his
usual
dignified
manner
but
in
the
kindest
and
sincerest
way
he
was
able
to
assume
good
morning
sir
francis
said
flora
rising
to
receive
him
and
she
could
not
avoid
looking
at
him
as
he
entered
the
room
i
hope
you
have
had
a
pleasant
night
it
has
been
the
best
night's
rest
i
have
had
for
some
time
miss
bannerworth
i
assure
you
i
have
to
express
my
gratitude
to
you
for
so
much
kindness
i
have
slept
well
and
soundly
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
i
think
yet
i
shall
escape
the
search
of
these
people
who
have
hunted
me
from
so
many
places
i
hope
you
may
indeed
sir
francis
you
miss
bannerworth
and
do
you
hope
i
may
escape
the
vengeance
of
these
people--the
populace
i
do
sir
francis
most
sincerely
hope
so
why
should
i
wish
evil
to
you
especially
at
their
hands
sir
francis
did
not
speak
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
he
said
turning
full
upon
flora--
i
don't
know
why
miss
bannerworth
that
i
should
think
so
but
perhaps
it
is
because
there
are
peculiar
circumstances
connected
with
myself
that
have
made
me
feel
conscious
that
i
have
not
deserved
so
much
goodness
at
your
hands
you
have
not
deserved
any
evil
sir
francis
we
could
not
do
that
if
it
were
in
our
power
we
would
do
you
a
service
at
any
time
you
have
done
so
miss
bannerworth--the
greatest
that
can
be
performed
you
have
saved
my
life
at
that
moment
charles
holland
entered
and
sir
francis
bowed
as
he
said--
i
hope
you
mr
holland
have
slept
as
well
and
passed
as
good
a
night
as
i
have
passed
i
am
glad
you
at
least
have
passed
a
quiet
one
said
charles
holland
you
i
dare
say
feel
all
the
better
for
it
how
do
you
feel
yourself
are
you
much
hurt
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
sir
francis
varney
only
a
few
bruises
and
so
forth
some
of
which
as
you
may
perceive
do
not
add
to
one's
personal
appearance
a
week
or
two's
quiet
would
rid
me
of
them
at
all
events
i
would
it
may
do
the
same
with
my
enemies
i
wish
they
were
as
easily
gotten
rid
of
myself
said
charles
but
as
that
cannot
be
we
must
endeavour
to
baffle
them
in
the
best
way
we
may
i
owe
a
debt
to
you
i
shall
never
be
able
to
repay
but
where
there
is
a
will
they
say
there
is
a
way
and
if
the
old
saying
be
good
for
anything
i
need
not
despair
though
the
way
is
by
no
means
apparent
at
present
time
is
the
magician
said
flora
whose
wand
changes
all
things--the
young
to
the
aged
and
the
aged
to
nothing
certainly
that
is
true
said
varney
and
many
such
changes
have
i
seen
my
mind
is
stored
with
such
events
but
this
is
sadness
and
i
have
cause
to
rejoice




the
breakfast
was
passed
off
in
pleasing
conversation
and
varney
found
himself
much
at
home
with
the
bannerworths
whose
calm
and
even
tenour
was
quite
new
to
him
he
could
not
but
admit
the
charms
of
such
a
life
as
that
led
by
the
bannerworths
but
what
it
must
have
been
when
they
were
supplied
by
ample
means
with
nothing
to
prey
upon
their
minds
and
no
fearful
mystery
to
hang
on
and
weigh
down
their
spirits
he
could
scarcely
imagine
they
were
amiable
accomplished
they
were
in
the
same
mind
at
all
times
and
nothing
seemed
to
ruffle
them
and
when
night
came
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
had
never
formed
half
the
opinion
of
them
they
were
deserving
of
of
course
during
that
day
he
was
compelled
to
lie
close
so
as
not
to
be
seen
by
any
one
save
the
family
he
sat
in
a
small
room
which
was
overlooked
by
no
other
in
the
neighbourhood
and
he
remained
quiet
sometimes
conversing
and
sometimes
reading
but
at
the
same
time
ever
attentive
to
the
least
sound
that
appeared
at
all
of
a
character
to
indicate
the
approach
of
persons
for
any
purpose
whatever
at
supper
time
he
spoke
to
flora
and
to
charles
holland
saying--
there
are
certain
matters
connected
with
myself--i
may
say
with
you
now--sure
all
that
has
happened
will
make
it
so--of
which
you
would
be
glad
to
hear
some
thing
you
mean
upon
the
same
subject
upon
which
i
had
some
conversation
with
you
a
day
or
two
back
yes
the
same
allow
me
one
week
and
you
shall
know
all
i
will
then
relate
to
you
that
which
you
so
much
desire
to
know--one
week
and
all
shall
be
told
well
said
charles
holland
this
has
not
been
exacted
from
you
as
the
price
of
your
safety
but
you
can
choose
your
own
time
of
course
what
you
promise
is
most
desired
for
it
will
render
those
happy
who
now
are
much
worse
than
they
were
before
these
occurrences
took
place
i
am
aware
of
all
that
grant
me
but
one
week
and
then
you
shall
be
made
acquainted
with
all
i
am
satisfied
sir
francis
said
flora
but
while
here
under
our
roof
we
should
never
have
asked
you
a
question
of
this
miss
bannerworth
the
little
i
have
seen
of
you
assures
me
you
would
not
do
so
however
i
am
the
more
inclined
to
make
it--i
am
under
so
deep
an
obligation
to
you
all
that
i
can
never
repay
it





sir
francis
varney
retired
to
rest
that
night--his
promise
to
the
bannerworths
filled
his
mind
with
many
reflections--the
insecurity
of
his
own
position
and
the
frail
tenure
which
he
even
held
in
the
hands
of
those
whom
he
had
most
injured
this
produced
a
series
of
reflections
of
a
grave
and
melancholy
nature
and
he
sat
by
his
window
watching
the
progress
of
the
clouds
as
they
appeared
to
chase
each
other
over
the
face
of
the
scene--now
casting
a
shade
over
the
earth
and
then
banishing
the
shadows
and
throwing
a
gentle
light
over
the
earth's
surface
which
was
again
chased
away
and
shadows
again
fell
upon
the
scene
below
how
long
he
had
sat
there
in
melancholy
musing
he
knew
not
but
suddenly
he
was
aroused
from
his
dreams
by
a
voice
that
shook
the
skies
and
caused
him
to
start
to
his
feet
hurrah--hurrah--hurrah
shouted
the
mob
which
had
silently
collected
around
the
cottage
of
the
bannerworths
curses
muttered
sir
francis
as
he
again
sank
in
his
chair
and
struck
his
head
with
his
hand
i
am
hunted
to
death--they
will
not
leave
me
until
my
body
has
graced
a
cross-road
hurrah--down
with
the
vampyre--pull
him
out
then
came
an
instant
knocking
at
the
doors
and
the
people
on
the
outside
made
so
great
a
din
that
it
seemed
as
though
they
contemplated
knocking
the
house
down
at
once
without
warning
the
inmates
that
they
waited
there
there
was
a
cessation
for
about
a
minute
when
one
of
the
family
hastened
to
the
door
and
inquired
what
was
wanted
varney
the
vampyre
was
the
reply
you
must
seek
him
elsewhere
we
will
search
this
place
before
we
go
further
replied
a
man
but
he
is
not
here
we
have
reason
to
believe
otherwise
open
the
door
and
let
us
in--no
one
shall
be
hurt
or
one
single
object
in
the
house
but
we
must
come
in
and
search
for
the
vampyre
come
to-morrow
then
that
will
not
do
said
the
voice
open
or
we
force
our
way
in
without
more
notice
at
the
same
a
tremendous
blow
was
bestowed
upon
the
door
and
then
much
force
was
used
to
thrust
it
in
a
consultation
was
suddenly
held
among
the
inmates
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
but
no
one
could
advise
and
each
was
well
aware
of
the
utter
impossibility
of
keeping
the
mob
out
i
do
not
see
what
is
to
become
of
me
said
sir
francis
varney
suddenly
appearing
before
them
you
must
let
them
in
there
is
no
chance
of
keeping
them
off
neither
can
you
conceal
me
you
will
have
no
place
save
one
that
will
be
sacred
from
their
profanation
and
which
is
that
flora's
own
room
all
started
at
the
thought
that
flora's
chamber
could
in
any
way
be
profaned
by
any
such
presence
as
sir
francis
varney's
however
the
doors
below
were
suddenly
burst
open
amid
loud
cries
from
the
populace
who
rushed
in
in
great
numbers
and
began
to
search
the
lower
rooms
immediately
all
is
lost
said
sir
francis
varney
as
he
dashed
away
and
rushed
to
the
chamber
of
flora
who
alarmed
at
the
sounds
that
were
now
filling
the
house
stood
listening
to
them
miss
bannerworth--
began
varney
sir
francis
yes
it
is
indeed
i
miss
bannerworth
hear
me
for
one
moment
what
is
the
matter
i
am
again
in
peril--in
more
imminent
peril
than
before
my
life
is
not
worth
a
minute's
purchase
unless
you
save
me
you
and
you
alone
can
now
save
me
oh
miss
bannerworth
if
ever
pity
touched
your
heart
save
me
from
those
only
whom
i
now
fear
i
could
meet
death
in
any
shape
but
that
in
which
they
will
inflict
it
upon
me
hear
their
execrations
below
death
to
the
vampyre
death
to
varney
burn
him
run
a
stake
through
his
body
illustration
what
can
i
do
sir
francis
admit
me
to
your
chamber
sir
francis
are
you
aware
of
what
you
are
saying
i
am
well
it
is
a
request
which
you
would
justly
scorn
to
reply
to
but
now
my
life--recollect
you
have
saved
me
once--my
life--do
not
now
throw
away
the
boon
you
have
so
kindly
bestowed
save
me
miss
bannerworth
it
is
not
possible
i--
nay
miss
bannerworth
do
you
imagine
this
is
a
time
for
ceremony
or
the
observances
of
polished
life
on
my
honour
you
run
no
risk
of
censure
where
is
varney
where
is
the
vampyre
he
ain't
far
off
hear--hear
them
miss
bannerworth
they
are
now
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
not
a
moment
to
lose
one
minute
more
and
i
am
in
the
hands
of
a
crew
that
has
no
mercy
hurrah
upstairs
he's
not
below
upstairs
neighbours
we
shall
have
him
yet
these
words
sounded
on
the
stairs
half-a-dozen
more
steps
and
varney
would
be
seen
it
was
a
miracle
he
was
not
heard
begging
for
his
life
varney
cast
a
look
of
despair
at
the
stairhead
and
felt
for
his
sword
but
it
was
not
there
he
had
lost
it
he
struck
his
head
with
his
clenched
hand
and
was
about
to
rush
upon
his
foes
when
he
heard
the
lock
turn
he
looked
and
saw
the
door
opened
gently
and
flora
stood
there
he
passed
in
and
sank
cowering
into
a
chair
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
behind
some
curtains
the
door
was
scarcely
shut
ere
some
tried
to
force
it
and
then
a
loud
knocking
came
at
the
door
open
open
we
want
varney
the
vampyre
open
or
we
will
burst
it
open
flora
did
open
it
but
stood
resolutely
in
the
opening
and
held
up
her
hand
to
impose
silence
are
you
men
that
you
can
come
thus
to
force
yourselves
upon
the
privacy
of
a
female
is
there
nothing
in
the
town
or
house
that
you
must
intrude
in
numbers
into
a
private
apartment
is
no
place
sacred
from
you
but
ma'am--miss--we
only
want
varney
the
vampyre
and
can
you
find
him
nowhere
but
in
a
female's
bedroom
shame
on
you
shame
on
you
have
you
no
sisters
wives
or
mothers
that
you
act
thus
he's
not
there
you
may
be
sure
of
that
jack
said
a
gruff
voice
let
the
lady
be
in
quiet
she's
had
quite
enough
trouble
with
him
to
sicken
her
of
a
vampyre
you
may
be
sure
that's
the
last
place
to
find
him
in
with
this
they
all
turned
away
and
flora
shut
the
door
and
locked
it
upon
them
and
varney
was
safe
you
have
saved
me
said
varney
hush
said
flora
speak
not
there
maybe
some
one
listening
sir
francis
varney
stood
in
the
attitude
of
one
listening
most
anxiously
to
catch
some
sounds
the
moon
fell
across
his
face
and
gave
it
a
ghastly
hue
that
added
to
his
natural
paleness
and
wounds
gave
him
an
almost
unearthly
aspect
the
sounds
grew
more
and
more
distant
the
shouts
and
noise
of
men
traversing
the
apartments
subsided
and
gradually
the
place
became
restored
to
its
original
silence
the
mob
after
having
searched
every
other
part
of
the
house
and
not
finding
the
object
of
their
search
they
concluded
that
he
was
not
there
but
must
have
made
his
escape
before





this
most
desperate
peril
of
sir
francis
varney
seemed
to
have
more
effect
upon
him
than
anything
that
had
occurred
during
his
most
strange
and
most
eventful
career
when
he
was
assured
that
the
riotous
mob
that
had
been
so
intent
upon
his
destruction
was
gone
and
that
he
might
emerge
from
his
place
of
concealment
he
did
so
with
an
appearance
of
such
utter
exhaustion
that
the
bannerworth
family
could
not
but
look
upon
him
as
a
being
who
was
near
his
end
at
any
time
his
countenance
as
we
long
have
had
occasion
to
remark
was
a
strange
and
unearthly
looking
one
but
when
we
come
to
superadd
to
the
strangeness
of
his
ordinary
appearance
the
traces
of
deep
mental
emotion
we
may
well
say
that
varney's
appearance
was
positively
of
the
most
alarming
character
when
he
was
seated
in
the
ordinary
sitting
apartment
of
the
bannerworths
he
drew
a
long
sighing
breath
and
placing
his
hand
upon
his
heart
he
said
in
a
faint
tone
of
voice--
it
beats
now
laboriously
but
it
will
soon
cease
its
pulsations
for
ever
these
words
sounded
absolutely
prophetic
there
was
about
them
such
a
solemn
aspect
and
he
looked
at
the
same
time
that
he
uttered
them
so
much
like
one
whose
mortal
race
was
run
and
who
was
now
a
candidate
for
the
grave
do
not
speak
so
despairingly
said
charles
holland
remember
that
if
your
life
has
been
one
of
errors
hitherto
how
short
a
space
of
time
may
suffice
to
redeem
some
of
them
at
least
and
the
communication
to
me
which
you
have
not
yet
completed
may
to
some
extent
have
such
an
effect
no
no
it
may
contribute
to
an
act
of
justice
but
it
can
do
no
good
to
me
and
yet
do
not
suppose
that
because
such
is
my
impression
that
i
mean
to
hesitate
in
finishing
to
you
that
communication
i
rejoice
to
hear
you
say
so
and
if
you
would
now
that
you
must
be
aware
of
what
good
feelings
towards
you
we
are
all
animated
with
remove
the
bar
of
secrecy
from
the
communication
i
should
esteem
it
a
great
favour
varney
appeared
to
be
considering
for
a
few
moments
and
then
he
said--
well
well
let
the
secrecy
no
longer
exist
have
it
removed
at
once
i
will
no
longer
seek
to
maintain
it
tell
all
charles
holland--tell
all
thus
empowered
by
the
mysterious
being
charles
holland
related
briefly
what
varney
had
already
told
him
and
then
concluded
by
saying--
that
is
all
that
i
have
myself
as
yet
been
made
aware
of
and
i
now
call
upon
sir
francis
varney
to
finish
his
narration
i
am
weak
said
varney
and
scarcely
equal
to
the
task
but
yet
i
will
not
shrink
from
the
promise
that
i
have
made
you
have
been
the
preservers
of
my
life
and
more
particularly
to
you
flora
bannerworth
am
i
indebted
for
an
existence
which
otherwise
must
have
been
sacrificed
upon
the
altar
of
superstition
but
you
will
recollect
master
varney
said
the
admiral
who
had
sat
looking
on
for
some
time
in
silent
wonder
you
must
recollect
master
varney
that
the
people
are
after
all
not
so
much
to
blame
for
their
superstition
because
whether
you
are
a
vampyre
or
not
and
i
don't
pretend
to
come
to
a
positive
opinion
now
you
took
good
care
to
persuade
them
you
were
i
did
said
varney
with
a
shudder
but
why
did
i
well
you
know
best
it
was
then
because
i
did
believe
and
do
believe
that
there
is
something
more
than
natural
about
my
strangely
protracted
existence
but
we
will
waive
that
point
and
before
my
failing
strength
for
it
appears
to
me
to
be
failing
completely
prevents
me
from
doing
so
let
me
relate
to
you
the
continued
particulars
of
the
circumstances
that
made
me
what
i
am
flora
bannerworth
although
she
had
heard
before
from
the
lips
of
charles
holland
the
to
her
dreadful
fact
that
her
father
in
addition
to
having
laid
violent
hands
upon
his
own
life
was
a
murderer
now
that
that
fearful
circumstance
was
related
more
publicly
felt
a
greater
pang
than
she
had
done
when
it
was
whispered
to
her
in
the
accents
of
pure
affection
and
softened
down
by
a
gentleness
of
tone
which
charles
holland's
natural
delicacy
would
not
allow
him
to
use
even
to
her
whom
he
loved
so
well
in
the
presence
of
others
she
let
her
beautiful
face
be
hidden
by
her
hands
and
she
wept
as
she
listened
to
the
sad
detail
varney
looked
inquiringly
in
the
countenance
of
charles
holland
because
having
given
him
leave
to
make
flora
acquainted
with
the
circumstance
he
was
rather
surprised
at
the
amount
of
emotion
which
it
produced
in
her
charles
holland
answered
the
appealing
look
by
saying--
flora
is
already
aware
of
the
facts
but
it
naturally
affects
her
much
to
hear
them
now
repeated
in
the
presence
of
others
and
those
too
towards
whom
she
cannot
feel--
what
charles
holland
was
going
to
say
was
abruptly
stopped
short
by
the
admiral
who
interposed
exclaiming--
why
what
do
you
mean
you
son
of
a
sea
cook
the
presence
of
who
do
you
mean
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
don't
feel
for
miss
flora
bless
her
heart
quite
as
much
as
a
white-faced
looking
swab
like
you
why
i
shall
begin
to
think
you
are
only
fit
for
a
marine
nay
uncle
now
do
not
put
yourself
out
of
temper
you
must
be
well
aware
that
i
could
not
mean
anything
disrespectful
to
you
you
should
not
suppose
such
a
state
of
things
possible
and
although
perhaps
i
did
not
express
myself
so
felicitously
as
i
might
yet
what
i
intended
to
say
was--
oh
bother
what
you
intended
to
say
you
go
on
mr
vampyre
with
your
story
i
want
to
know
what
became
of
it
all
just
you
get
on
as
quick
as
you
can
and
let
us
know
what
you
did
after
the
man
was
murdered
when
the
dreadful
deed
was
committed
said
varney
and
our
victim
lay
weltering
in
his
blood
and
had
breathed
his
last
we
stood
like
men
who
for
the
first
time
were
awakened
to
the
frightful
consequences
of
what
they
had
done
i
saw
by
the
dim
light
that
hovered
round
us
a
great
change
come
over
the
countenance
of
marmaduke
bannerworth
and
he
shook
in
every
limb
this
soon
passed
away
however
and
the
powerful
and
urgent
necessity
which
arose
of
avoiding
the
consequences
of
the
deed
that
we
had
done
restored
us
to
ourselves
we
stooped
and
took
from
the
body
the
ill-gotten
gains
of
the
gambler
they
amounted
to
an
immense
sum
and
i
said
to
marmaduke
bannerworth--
'take
you
the
whole
of
this
money
and
proceed
to
your
own
home
with
it
where
you
will
be
least
suspected
hide
it
in
some
place
of
great
secrecy
and
to-morrow
i
will
call
upon
you
when
we
will
divide
it
and
will
consider
of
some
means
of
safely
exchanging
the
notes
for
gold'
he
agreed
to
this
and
placed
the
money
in
his
pocket
after
which
it
became
necessary
that
we
should
dispose
of
the
body
which
if
we
did
not
quickly
remove
must
in
a
few
hours
be
discovered
and
so
perchance
accompanied
by
other
criminating
circumstances
become
a
frightful
evidence
against
us
and
entail
upon
us
all
those
consequences
of
the
deed
which
we
were
so
truly
anxious
to
escape
from
it
is
ever
the
worst
part
of
the
murderer's
task
that
after
he
has
struck
the
blow
that
has
deprived
his
victim
of
existence
it
becomes
his
frightful
duty
to
secrete
the
corpse
which
with
its
dead
eyes
ever
seems
to
be
glaring
upon
him
such
a
world
of
reproach
that
it
is
which
should
make
people
pause
ere
they
dipped
their
hands
in
the
blood
of
others
and
that
it
is
which
becomes
the
first
retribution
that
the
murderer
has
to
endure
for
the
deep
crime
that
he
has
committed
we
tore
two
stakes
from
a
hedge
and
with
their
assistance
we
contrived
to
dig
a
very
superficial
hole
such
a
hole
as
was
only
sufficient
by
placing
a
thin
coating
of
earth
over
it
to
conceal
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
and
then
came
the
loathsome
task
of
dragging
him
into
it--a
task
full
of
horror
and
from
which
we
shrunk
aghast
but
it
had
to
be
done
and
therefore
we
stooped
and
grasping
the
clothes
as
best
we
might
we
dragged
the
body
into
the
chasm
we
had
prepared
for
its
reception
glad
were
we
then
to
be
enabled
to
throw
the
earth
upon
it
and
to
stamp
upon
it
with
such
vehemence
as
might
well
be
supposed
to
actuate
men
deeply
anxious
to
put
out
of
sight
some
dangerous
and
loathsome
object
when
we
had
completed
this
and
likewise
gathered
handsfull
of
dust
from
the
road
and
dry
leaves
and
such
other
matter
to
sprinkle
upon
the
grave
so
as
to
give
the
earth
an
appearance
of
not
having
been
disturbed
we
looked
at
each
other
and
breathed
from
our
toil
then
and
not
till
then
was
it
that
we
remembered
that
among
other
things
which
the
gambler
had
won
of
marmaduke
were
the
deeds
belonging
to
the
dearbrook
property
the
dearbrook
property
exclaimed
henry
bannerworth
i
know
that
there
was
a
small
estate
going
by
that
name
which
belonged
to
our
family
but
i
always
understood
that
long
ago
my
father
had
parted
with
it
yes
it
was
mortgaged
for
a
small
sum--a
sum
not
a
fourth
part
of
its
value--and
it
had
been
redeemed
by
marmaduke
bannerworth
not
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
it
but
in
order
that
he
might
sell
it
outright
and
so
partially
remedy
his
exhausted
finances
i
was
not
aware
of
that
returned
henry
doubtless
you
were
not
for
of
late--i
mean
for
the
twelve
months
or
so
preceding
your
father's
death--you
know
he
was
much
estranged
from
all
the
family
so
that
you
none
of
you
knew
much
of
what
he
was
doing
except
that
he
was
carrying
on
a
very
wild
and
reckless
career
such
as
was
sure
to
end
in
dishonour
and
poverty
but
i
tell
you
he
had
the
title
deeds
of
the
dearbrook
property
and
that
they
were
only
got
from
him
along
with
everything
else
of
value
that
he
possessed
at
the
gaming-table
by
the
man
who
paid
such
a
fearful
penalty
for
his
success
it
was
not
until
after
the
body
was
completely
buried
and
we
had
completed
all
our
precautions
for
more
effectually
hiding
it
from
observation
that
we
recollected
the
fact
of
those
important
papers
being
in
his
possession
it
was
marmaduke
bannerworth
who
first
remembered
it
and
he
exclaimed--
'by
heaven
we
have
buried
the
title
deeds
of
the
property
and
we
shall
have
again
to
exhume
the
corpse
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
them'
now
those
deeds
were
nothing
to
me
and
repugnant
as
i
had
felt
from
the
first
to
having
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
dead
body
it
was
not
likely
that
i
would
again
drag
it
from
the
earth
for
such
an
object
'marmaduke
bannerworth'
i
said
'you
can
do
what
you
please
and
take
the
consequences
of
what
you
do
but
i
will
not
again
if
i
can
help
it
look
upon
the
face
of
that
corpse
it
is
too
fearful
a
sight
to
contemplate
again
you
have
a
large
sum
of
money
and
what
need
you
care
now
for
the
title
deeds
of
a
property
comparatively
insignificant'
'well
well'
he
said
'i
will
not
at
the
present
time
disturb
the
remains
i
will
wait
to
see
if
anything
should
arise
from
the
fact
of
the
murder
if
it
should
turn
out
that
no
suspicion
of
any
kind
is
excited
but
that
all
is
still
and
quiet
i
can
then
take
measures
to
exhume
the
corpse
and
recover
those
papers
which
certainly
are
important'
by
this
time
the
morning
was
creeping
on
apace
and
we
thought
it
prudent
to
leave
the
spot
we
stood
at
the
end
of
the
lane
for
a
few
moments
conversing
and
those
moments
were
the
last
in
which
i
ever
saw
marmaduke
bannerworth
answer
me
a
question
said
henry
i
will
ask
me
what
you
please
i
will
answer
it
was
it
you
that
called
at
bannerworth
hall
after
my
father's
melancholy
death
and
inquired
for
him
i
did
and
when
i
heard
of
the
deed
that
he
had
done
i
at
once
left
in
order
to
hold
counsel
with
myself
as
to
what
i
should
do
to
obtain
at
least
a
portion
of
the
property
one-half
of
which
it
was
understood
was
to
have
been
mine
i
heard
what
had
been
the
last
words
used
by
marmaduke
bannerworth
on
the
occasion
of
his
death
and
they
were
amply
sufficient
to
let
me
know
what
had
been
done
with
the
money--at
all
events
so
far
as
regards
the
bestowal
of
it
in
some
secret
place
and
from
that
moment
the
idea
of
by
some
means
or
another
getting
the
exclusive
possession
of
it
never
forsook
my
mind
i
thought
over
the
matter
by
day
and
by
night
and
with
the
exception
of
having
a
knowledge
of
the
actual
hiding-place
of
the
money
i
could
see
in
the
clearest
possible
manner
how
the
whole
affair
had
been
transacted
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
marmaduke
bannerworth
had
reached
home
safely
with
the
large
sum
of
which
he
had
become
possessed
and
that
he
had
hidden
it
securely
which
was
but
an
ordinary
measure
of
precaution
when
we
come
to
consider
how
the
property
had
been
obtained
then
i
suspect
that
being
alone
and
left
to
the
gloom
of
his
own
miserable
thoughts
they
reverted
so
painfully
to
the
past
that
he
was
compelled
to
drink
deeply
for
the
purpose
of
drowning
reflection
the
natural
consequence
of
this
in
his
state
was
that
partial
insanity
supervened
and
at
a
moment
when
frenzy
rose
far
above
reflection
he
must
have
committed
the
dreadful
act
which
hurried
him
instantaneously
to
eternity
yes
said
henry
it
must
have
been
so
you
have
guessed
truly
he
did
on
that
occasion
drink
an
immense
quantity
of
wine
but
instead
of
stilling
the
pangs
of
remorse
it
must
have
increased
them
and
placed
him
in
such
a
frenzied
condition
of
intellect
that
he
found
it
impossible
to
withstand
the
impulse
of
it
unless
by
the
terrific
act
which
ended
his
existence
yes
and
which
at
once
crushed
all
my
expectations
of
the
large
fortune
which
was
to
have
been
mine
for
even
the
one-half
of
the
sum
which
had
been
taken
from
the
gamester's
pocket
would
have
been
sufficient
to
have
enabled
me
to
live
for
the
future
in
affluence
i
became
perfectly
maddened
at
the
idea
that
so
large
a
sum
had
passed
out
of
my
hands
i
constantly
hovered
about
bannerworth
hall
hoping
and
expecting
that
something
might
arise
which
would
enable
me
to
get
admittance
to
it
and
make
an
active
search
through
its
recesses
for
the
hidden
treasure
all
my
exertions
were
in
vain
i
could
hit
upon
no
scheme
whatever
and
at
length
wearied
and
exhausted
i
was
compelled
to
proceed
to
london
for
the
sake
of
a
subsistence
it
is
only
in
that
great
metropolis
that
such
persons
as
myself
destitute
of
real
resources
but
infinitely
reckless
as
regards
the
means
by
which
they
acquire
a
subsistence
can
hope
to
do
so
once
again
therefore
i
plunged
into
the
vortex
of
london
life
and
proceeded
heedless
of
the
criminality
of
what
i
was
about
to
cater
for
myself
by
robbery
or
indeed
in
any
manner
which
presented
a
prospect
of
success
it
was
during
this
career
of
mine
that
i
became
associated
with
some
of
the
most
desperate
characters
of
the
time
and
the
offences
we
committed
were
of
that
daring
character
that
it
could
not
be
wondered
at
eventually
so
formidable
a
gang
of
desperadoes
must
be
by
force
broken
up
it
so
occurred
but
unknown
to
us
that
the
police
resolved
upon
making
one
of
the
most
vigorous
efforts
to
put
an
end
to
the
affair
and
in
consequence
a
watch
was
set
upon
every
one
of
our
movements
the
result
of
this
was
as
might
have
been
expected
our
complete
dispersion
and
the
arrest
of
some
our
members
and
among
them
myself
i
knew
my
fate
almost
from
the
first
our
depredations
had
created
such
a
sensation
that
the
legislature
even
had
made
it
a
matter
of
importance
that
we
should
be
suppressed
and
it
was
an
understood
thing
among
the
judges
that
the
severest
penalties
of
the
law
should
be
inflicted
upon
any
one
of
the
gang
who
might
be
apprehended
and
convicted
my
trial
scarcely
occupied
an
hour
and
then
i
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
execution
with
an
intimation
from
the
judge
that
it
would
be
perfectly
absurd
of
me
to
dream
for
one
moment
of
a
remission
of
that
sentence
in
this
state
of
affairs
and
seeing
nothing
but
death
before
me
i
gave
myself
up
to
despair
and
narrowly
missed
cheating
the
hangman
of
his
victim
more
dead
than
alive
i
was
however
dragged
out
to
be
judicially
murdered
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
crowd
of
frightful
sensations
that
came
across
my
mind
upon
that
terrific
occasion
it
seemed
as
if
my
fate
had
then
reached
its
climax
and
i
have
really
but
a
dim
recollection
of
the
terrible
scene
i
remember
something
of
the
confused
murmur
arising
from
an
immense
throng
of
persons
i
remember
looking
about
me
and
seeing
nothing
but
what
appeared
to
me
an
immense
sea
of
human
heads
and
then
suddenly
i
heard
a
loud
roar
of
execration
burst
from
the
multitude
i
shrunk
back
terrified
and
it
did
indeed
seem
to
me
a
brutal
thing
thus
to
roar
and
shout
at
a
man
who
was
brought
out
to
die
i
soon
however
found
that
the
mob
who
came
to
see
such
a
spectacle
was
not
so
debased
as
i
imagined
but
that
it
was
at
the
hangman
who
had
suddenly
made
his
appearance
on
the
scaffold
at
whom
they
raised
that
fearful
yell
some
one--i
think
it
was
one
of
the
sheriffs--must
have
noticed
that
i
was
labouring
under
the
impression
that
the
cry
from
the
mob
was
levelled
at
me
for
he
spoke
saying--
'it
is
at
the
hangman
they
shout'
and
he
indicated
with
his
finger
that
public
functionary
in
my
mind's
eye
i
think
i
see
him
now
and
i
am
certain
that
i
shall
never
forget
the
expression
of
his
face
it
was
perfectly
fearful
and
afterwards
when
i
learned
who
and
what
he
was
i
was
not
surprised
that
he
should
feel
so
acutely
the
painfully
degrading
office
which
he
had
to
perform
the
fatal
rope
was
in
a
few
minutes
adjusted
to
my
neck
i
felt
its
pressure
and
i
heard
the
confused
sounds
of
the
monotonous
voice
of
the
clergyman
as
he
muttered
some
prayers
that
i
must
confess
sounded
to
me
at
the
time
like
a
mockery
of
human
suffering
then
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
shout--i
felt
the
platform
give
way
beneath
my
feet--i
tried
to
utter
a
yell
of
agony
but
could
not--it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
was
encompassed
by
fire
and
then
sensation
left
me
and
i
knew
no
more





the
next
feelings
of
existence
that
came
over
me
consisted
in
a
frightful
tingling
sensation
throughout
my
veins
and
i
felt
myself
making
vain
efforts
to
scream
all
the
sensations
of
a
person
suffering
from
a
severe
attack
of
nightmare
came
across
me
and
i
was
in
such
an
agony
that
i
inwardly
prayed
for
death
to
release
me
from
such
a
cruel
state
of
suffering
then
suddenly
the
power
to
utter
a
sound
came
to
me
and
i
made
use
of
it
well
for
the
piercing
shriek
i
uttered
must
have
struck
terror
into
the
hearts
of
all
who
heard
it
since
it
appalled
even
myself
then
i
suppose
i
must
have
fainted
but
when
i
recovered
consciousness
again
i
found
myself
upon
a
couch
and
a
man
presenting
some
stimulus
to
me
in
a
cup
i
could
not
distinguish
objects
distinctly
but
i
heard
him
say
'drink
and
you
will
be
better'
i
did
drink
for
a
raging
thirst
consumed
me
and
then
i
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
which
i
was
afterwards
told
lasted
nearly
twenty-four
hours
and
when
i
recovered
from
that
i
heard
again
the
same
voice
that
had
before
spoken
to
me
asking
me
how
i
was
i
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
as
my
vision
was
now
clearer
i
could
see
that
it
was
the
hangman
whose
face
had
made
upon
the
scaffold
such
an
impression
upon
me--an
impression
which
i
then
considered
my
last
in
this
world
but
which
turned
out
not
to
be
such
by
many
a
mingled
one
of
pain
and
pleasure
since
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
speak
and
when
i
did
it
was
only
in
a
few
muttered
words
to
ask
what
had
happened
and
where
i
was
'do
you
not
remember'
he
said
'that
you
were
hanged'
'i
do--i
do'
was
my
reply
'is
this
the
region
of
damned
souls'
'no
you
are
still
in
this
world
however
strange
you
may
think
it
listen
to
me
and
i
will
briefly
tell
you
how
it
is
that
you
have
come
back
again
as
it
were
from
the
very
grave
to
live
and
walk
about
among
the
living
i
listened
to
him
with
a
strange
and
rapt
attention
and
then
he
told
how
a
young
and
enthusiastic
medical
man
had
been
anxious
to
try
some
experiments
with
regard
to
the
restoration
of
persons
apparently
dead
and
he
proceeded
to
relate
how
it
was
that
he
had
given
ear
to
the
solicitations
of
the
man
and
had
consented
to
bring
my
body
after
it
was
hung
for
him
to
experiment
upon
he
related
how
the
doctor
had
been
successful
but
how
he
was
so
terrified
at
his
own
success
that
he
hastily
fled
and
had
left
london
no
one
knowing
whither
he
had
gone
i
listened
to
this
with
the
most
profound
attention
and
then
he
concluded
by
saying
to
me--
'there
can
be
no
doubt
but
my
duty
requires
of
me
to
give
you
up
again
to
the
offended
laws
of
your
country
i
will
not
however
do
that
if
you
will
consent
to
an
arrangement
that
i
shall
propose
to
you'
i
asked
him
what
the
arrangement
was
and
he
said
that
if
i
would
solemnly
bind
myself
to
pay
to
him
a
certain
sum
per
annum
he
would
keep
my
secret
and
forsaking
his
calling
as
hangman
endeavour
to
do
something
that
should
bring
with
it
pleasanter
results
i
did
so
solemnly
promise
him
and
i
have
kept
my
word
by
one
means
or
another
i
have
succeeded
in
procuring
the
required
amount
and
now
he
is
no
more
i
believe
cried
henry
that
he
has
fallen
a
victim
to
the
blind
fury
of
the
populace
you
are
right
he
has
so
and
accordingly
i
am
relieved
from
the
burden
of
those
payments
but
it
matters
little
for
now
i
am
so
near
the
tomb
myself
that
together
with
all
my
obligations
i
shall
soon
be
beyond
the
reach
of
mortal
cavilling
you
need
not
think
so
varney
you
must
remember
that
you
are
at
present
suffering
from
circumstances
the
pressure
of
which
will
soon
pass
away
and
then
you
will
resume
your
wonted
habits
what
did
you
do
next
said
the
admiral--let's
know
all
while
you
are
about
it
i
remained
at
the
hangman's
house
for
some
time
until
all
fear
of
discovery
was
over
and
then
he
removed
me
to
a
place
of
greater
security
providing
me
from
his
own
resources
with
the
means
of
existence
until
i
had
fully
recovered
my
health
and
then
he
told
me
to
shift
for
myself
during
my
confinement
though
i
had
not
been
idle
mentally
for
i
concocted
a
plan
by
which
i
should
be
enabled
not
only
to
live
well
myself
but
to
pay
to
the
hangman
whose
name
was
mortimore
the
annual
sum
i
had
agreed
upon
i
need
not
go
into
the
details
of
this
plan
of
course
it
was
neither
an
honest
nor
respectable
one
but
it
succeeded
and
i
soon
found
myself
in
a
position
to
enable
me
thereby
to
keep
my
engagement
as
well
as
to
supply
me
with
means
of
plotting
and
planning
for
my
future
fortunes
i
had
never
for
a
moment
forgotten
that
so
large
a
sum
of
money
was
somewhere
concealed
about
bannerworth
hall
and
i
still
looked
forward
to
obtaining
it
by
some
means
or
another
it
was
in
this
juncture
of
affairs
that
one
night
i
was
riding
on
horseback
through
a
desolate
part
of
england
the
moon
was
shining
sweetly
as
i
came
to
a
broad
stream
of
water
across
which
about
a
mile
further
on
i
saw
that
there
was
a
bridge
but
being
unwilling
to
waste
time
by
riding
up
to
it
and
fancying
by
the
lazy
ripple
of
the
waters
that
the
river
was
not
shallow
i
plunged
my
horse
boldly
into
the
stream
when
we
reached
its
centre
some
sudden
indisposition
must
have
seized
the
horse
for
instead
of
swimming
on
well
and
gallantly
as
it
had
done
before
it
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
plunged
headlong
into
the
torrent
i
could
not
swim
and
so
for
a
second
time
death
with
all
its
terrors
appeared
to
be
taking
possession
of
me
the
waters
rolled
over
my
head
gurgling
and
hissing
in
my
ears
and
then
all
was
past
i
know
no
more
until
i
found
myself
lying
upon
a
bright
green
meadow
and
the
full
beams
of
the
moon
shining
upon
me
i
was
giddy
and
sick
but
i
rose
and
walked
slowly
away
each
moment
gathering
fresh
strength
and
from
that
time
to
this
i
never
discovered
how
i
came
to
be
rescued
from
the
water
and
lying
upon
that
green
bank
it
has
ever
been
a
mystery
to
me
and
i
expect
it
ever
will
then
from
that
moment
the
idea
that
i
had
a
sort
of
charmed
life
came
across
me
and
i
walked
about
with
an
impression
that
such
was
the
case
until
i
came
across
a
man
who
said
that
he
was
a
hungarian
and
who
was
full
of
strange
stories
of
vampyres
among
other
things
he
told
me
that
a
vampyre
could
not
be
drowned
for
that
the
waters
would
cast
him
upon
its
banks
and
if
the
moonbeams
fell
upon
him
he
would
be
restored
to
life
this
was
precisely
my
story
and
from
that
moment
i
believed
myself
to
be
one
of
those
horrible
but
charmed
beings
doomed
to
such
a
protracted
existence
the
notion
grew
upon
me
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
until
it
became
quite
a
fixed
and
strong
belief
and
i
was
deceiving
no
one
when
i
played
the
horrible
part
that
has
been
attributed
to
me
but
you
don't
mean
to
say
that
you
believe
you
are
a
vampyre
now
said
the
admiral
i
say
nothing
and
know
not
what
to
think
i
am
a
desperate
man
and
what
there
is
at
all
human
in
me
strange
to
say
all
of
you
whom
i
sought
to
injure
have
awakened
heed
not
that
said
henry
but
continue
your
narrative
we
have
forgiven
everything
and
that
ought
to
suffice
to
quiet
your
mind
upon
such
a
subject
i
will
continue
and
believe
me
i
will
conceal
nothing
from
you
i
look
upon
the
words
i
am
now
uttering
as
a
full
candid
and
free
confession
and
therefore
it
shall
be
complete
the
idea
struck
me
that
if
by
taking
advantage
of
my
supposed
preternatural
gifts
i
could
drive
you
from
bannerworth
hall
i
should
have
it
to
myself
to
hunt
through
at
my
leisure
and
possibly
find
the
treasure
i
had
heard
from
marmaduke
bannerworth
some
slight
allusion
to
concealing
the
money
behind
a
picture
that
was
in
a
bed-room
called
the
panelled
chamber
by
inquiry
i
ascertained
that
in
that
bed-room
slept
flora
bannerworth
i
had
resolved
however
at
first
to
try
pacific
measures
and
accordingly
as
you
are
well
aware
i
made
various
proposals
to
you
to
purchase
or
to
rent
bannerworth
hall
the
whole
of
which
you
rejected
so
that
i
found
myself
compelled
to
adopt
the
original
means
that
had
suggested
themselves
to
me
and
endeavour
to
terrify
you
from
the
house
by
prowling
about
i
made
myself
familiar
with
the
grounds
and
with
all
the
plan
of
the
residence
and
then
one
night
made
my
appearance
in
flora's
chamber
by
the
window
but
how
do
you
account
said
charles
holland
for
your
extraordinary
likeness
to
the
portrait
it
is
partly
natural
for
i
belong
to
a
collateral
branch
of
the
family
and
it
was
previously
arranged
i
had
seen
the
portrait
in
marmaduke
bannerworth's
time
and
i
knew
some
of
its
peculiarities
and
dress
sufficiently
well
to
imitate
them
i
calculated
upon
producing
a
much
greater
effect
by
such
an
imitation
and
it
appears
that
i
was
not
wrong
for
i
did
produce
it
to
the
full
you
did
indeed
said
henry
and
if
you
did
not
bring
conviction
to
our
minds
that
you
were
what
you
represented
yourself
to
be
you
at
least
staggered
our
judgments
upon
the
occasion
and
left
us
in
a
position
of
great
doubt
and
difficulty
i
did
i
did
all
that
i
know
i
did
and
by
pursuing
that
line
of
conduct
i
at
last
i
presume
entirely
forced
you
from
the
house
that
you
did
flora
fainted
when
i
entered
her
chamber
and
the
moment
i
looked
upon
her
sweet
countenance
my
heart
smote
me
for
what
i
was
about
but
i
solemnly
aver
that
my
lips
never
touched
her
and
that
beyond
the
fright
she
suffered
nothing
from
varney
the
vampyre
and
have
you
succeeded
said
henry
in
your
object
now
no
the
treasure
has
yet
to
be
found
mortimore
the
hangman
followed
me
into
the
house
guessing
my
intention
and
indulging
a
hope
that
he
would
succeed
in
sharing
with
me
its
proceeds
but
he
as
well
as
myself
was
foiled
and
nothing
came
of
the
toilsome
and
anxious
search
but
disappointment
and
bitterness
then
it
is
supposed
that
the
money
is
still
concealed
i
hope
so
i
hope
as
well
that
it
will
be
discovered
by
you
and
yours
for
surely
none
can
have
a
better
right
to
it
than
you
who
have
suffered
so
much
on
its
account
and
yet
remarked
henry
i
cannot
help
thinking
it
is
too
securely
hidden
from
us
the
picture
has
been
repeatedly
removed
from
its
place
and
produced
no
results
so
that
i
fear
we
have
little
to
expect
from
any
further
or
more
protracted
research
i
think
said
varney
that
you
have
everything
to
expect
the
words
of
the
dying
marmaduke
bannerworth
you
may
depend
were
not
spoken
in
vain
and
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
sooner
or
later
you
must
without
question
become
the
possessors
of
that
sum
but
ought
we
rightly
to
hold
it
who
ought
more
rightly
to
hold
it
said
varney
answer
me
that
that's
a
sensible
enough
idea
of
your's
said
the
admiral
and
if
you
were
twice
over
a
vampyre
i
would
tell
you
so
it's
a
very
sensible
idea
i
should
like
to
know
who
has
more
right
to
it
than
those
who
have
had
such
a
world
of
trouble
about
it
well
well
said
henry
we
must
not
dispute
as
yet
about
a
sum
of
money
that
may
really
never
come
to
hand
for
my
own
part
i
have
little
to
hope
for
in
the
matter
but
certainly
nothing
shall
be
spared
on
my
part
to
effect
such
a
thorough
search
of
the
hall
as
shall
certainly
bring
it
to
light
if
it
be
in
existence
i
presume
sir
francis
varney
said
charles
holland
that
you
have
now
completed
your
narrative
i
have
after
events
are
well
known
to
you
and
now
i
have
but
to
lie
down
and
die
with
the
hope
of
finding
that
rest
and
consolation
in
the
tomb
which
has
been
denied
me
hitherto
in
this
world
my
life
has
been
a
stormy
one
and
full
of
the
results
of
angry
passions
i
do
hope
now
that
for
the
short
time
i
have
to
live
i
shall
know
something
like
serenity
and
die
in
peace
you
may
depend
varney
that
as
long
as
you
have
an
asylum
with
us
said
the
admiral--and
that
you
may
have
as
long
as
you
like--you
may
be
at
peace
i
consider
that
you
have
surrendered
at
discretion
and
under
such
circumstances
an
enemy
always
deserves
honourable
treatment
and
always
gets
it
on
board
such
a
ship
as
this
there
you
go
again
said
jack
calling
the
house
a
ship
what's
that
to
you
if
i
were
to
call
it
a
bowsprit
ain't
i
your
captain
you
lubber
and
so
sure
to
be
right
while
you
are
wrong
in
the
natural
order
of
things
but
you
go
and
lay
down
master
varney
and
rest
yourself
for
you
seem
completely
done
up
varney
did
look
fearfully
exhausted
and
with
the
assistance
of
henry
and
charles
he
went
into
another
apartment
and
laid
down
upon
a
couch
showing
great
symptoms
of
debility
and
want
of
power
and
now
it
was
a
calm
varney's
stay
at
the
cottage
of
the
bannerworths
was
productive
of
a
different
mood
of
mind
than
ever
he
had
possessed
before
he
looked
upon
them
in
a
very
different
manner
to
what
he
had
been
used
to
he
had
moreover
considerably
altered
prospects
there
could
not
be
the
same
hopes
and
expectations
that
he
once
had
he
was
an
altered
man
he
saw
in
the
bannerworths
those
who
had
saved
his
life
and
who
without
doubt
had
possessed
an
opinion
not
merely
obnoxious
to
him
but
must
have
had
some
fearful
misgivings
concerning
his
character
and
that
too
of
a
nature
that
usually
shuts
out
all
hope
of
being
received
into
any
family
but
in
the
hour
of
his
need
when
his
life
was
in
danger
no
one
else
would
have
done
what
they
had
done
for
him
especially
when
so
relatively
placed
moreover
he
had
been
concealed
when
to
do
so
was
both
dangerous
and
difficult
and
then
it
was
done
by
flora
bannerworth
herself
time
flew
by
the
mode
of
passing
time
at
the
cottage
was
calm
and
serene
varney
had
seldom
witnessed
anything
like
it
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
more
at
ease
than
ever
he
had
he
was
charmed
with
the
society
of
flora--in
fact
with
the
whole
of
the
little
knot
of
individuals
who
there
collected
together
from
what
he
saw
he
was
gratified
in
their
society
and
it
seemed
to
alleviate
his
mental
disquiet
and
the
sense
he
must
feel
of
his
own
peculiar
position
but
varney
became
ill
the
state
of
mind
and
body
he
had
been
in
for
some
time
past
might
be
the
cause
of
it
he
had
been
much
harassed
and
hunted
from
place
to
place
there
was
not
a
moment
in
which
his
life
was
not
in
danger
and
he
had
moreover
more
than
one
case
received
some
bodily
injuries
bruises
and
contusions
of
a
desperate
character
and
yet
he
would
take
no
notice
of
them
but
allow
them
to
get
well
again
as
best
they
could
illustration
his
escapes
and
injuries
had
made
a
deep
impression
upon
his
mind
and
had
no
doubt
a
corresponding
effect
upon
his
body
and
varney
became
very
ill
flora
bannerworth
did
all
that
could
be
done
for
one
in
his
painful
position
and
this
greatly
added
to
the
depths
of
thought
that
occasionally
beset
him
and
he
could
scarcely
draw
one
limb
after
the
other
he
walked
from
room
to
room
in
the
twilight
at
which
time
he
had
more
liberty
permitted
him
than
at
any
other
because
there
was
not
the
same
danger
in
his
doing
so
for
if
once
seen
there
could
be
no
manner
of
doubt
but
he
would
have
been
pursued
until
he
was
destroyed
when
no
other
means
of
escape
were
at
hand
and
varney
himself
felt
that
there
could
be
no
chance
of
his
again
escaping
from
them
for
his
physical
powers
were
fast
decaying
he
was
not
in
fact
the
same
man
he
came
out
into
the
parlour
from
the
room
in
which
he
had
been
seated
during
the
day
flora
and
her
mother
were
there
while
charles
holland
and
henry
bannerworth
had
both
at
that
moment
entered
the
apartment
good
evening
miss
bannerworth
said
sir
francis
bowing
to
her
and
then
to
her
mother
mrs
bannerworth
and
you
mr
holland
i
see
have
been
out
enjoying
the
free
breeze
that
plays
over
the
hot
fields
it
must
be
refreshing
it
is
so
sir
said
charles
i
wish
we
could
make
you
a
partaker
in
our
walks
i
wish
you
could
with
all
my
heart
said
varney
sir
francis
said
flora
must
be
a
prisoner
for
some
short
time
longer
yet
i
ought
not
to
consider
it
in
any
such
light
it
is
not
imprisonment
i
have
taken
sanctuary
it
is
the
well
spring
of
life
to
me
said
varney
i
hope
it
may
prove
so
but
how
do
you
find
yourself
this
evening
sir
francis
varney
really
it
is
difficult
to
say--i
fluctuate
at
times
i
feel
as
though
i
should
drop
insensible
on
the
earth
and
then
i
feel
better
than
i
have
done
for
some
time
previously
doctor
chillingworth
will
be
here
bye
and
bye
no
doubt
and
he
must
see
what
he
can
do
for
you
to
relieve
you
of
these
symptoms
said
flora
i
am
much
beholden
to
you--much
beholden
to
you
but
i
hope
to
be
able
to
do
without
the
good
doctor's
aid
in
this
instance
though
i
must
admit
i
may
appear
ungrateful
not
at
all--not
at
all
have
you
heard
any
news
abroad
to-day
inquired
varney
none
sir
francis--none
there
is
nothing
apparently
stirring
and
now
go
out
when
you
would
you
would
find
nothing
but
what
was
old
quiet
and
familiar
we
cannot
wish
to
look
upon
anything
with
mere
charms
for
a
mind
at
ease
than
we
can
see
under
such
circumstances
but
i
fear
there
are
some
few
old
and
familiar
features
that
i
should
find
sad
havoc
in
you
would
certainly
for
the
burnings
and
razings
to
the
ground
of
some
places
have
made
some
dismal
appearances
but
time
may
efface
that
and
then
the
evil
may
die
away
and
the
future
will
become
the
present
should
we
be
able
to
allay
popular
feeling
yes
said
sir
francis
but
popular
prejudices
or
justice
or
feeling
are
things
not
easily
assuaged
the
people
when
once
aroused
go
on
to
commit
all
kinds
of
excess
and
there
is
no
one
point
at
which
they
will
step
short
of
the
complete
extirpation
of
some
one
object
or
other
that
they
have
taken
a
fancy
to
hunt
the
hubbub
and
excitement
must
subside
the
greater
the
ignorance
the
more
persevering
and
the
more
brutal
they
are
said
sir
francis
but
i
must
not
complain
of
what
is
the
necessary
consequence
of
their
state
it
might
be
otherwise
so
it
might
and
no
mischief
arise
either
but
as
we
cannot
divert
the
stream
we
may
as
well
bend
to
the
force
of
a
current
too
strong
to
resist
the
moon
is
up
said
flora
who
wished
to
turn
the
conversation
from
that
to
another
topic
i
see
it
yonder
through
the
trees
it
rises
red
and
large--it
is
very
beautiful--and
yet
there
is
not
a
cloud
about
to
give
it
the
colour
and
appearance
it
now
wears
exactly
so
said
sir
francis
varney
but
the
reason
is
the
air
is
filled
with
a
light
invisible
vapour
that
has
the
effect
you
perceive
there
has
been
much
evaporation
going
on
and
now
it
shows
itself
in
giving
the
moon
that
peculiar
large
appearance
and
deep
colour
ay
i
see
it
peeps
through
the
trees
the
branches
of
which
cut
it
up
into
various
portions
it
is
singular
and
yet
beautiful
and
yet
the
earth
below
seems
dark
it
is
dark
you
would
be
surprised
to
find
it
so
if
you
walked
about
it
will
soon
be
lighter
than
it
is
at
this
present
moment
what
sounds
are
those
inquired
sir
francis
varney
as
he
listened
attentively
sounds
what
sounds
returned
henry
the
sounds
of
wheels
and
horses'
feet
said
varney
i
cannot
even
hear
them
much
less
can
i
tell
what
they
are
said
henry
then
listen
now
they
come
along
the
road
cannot
you
hear
them
now
said
varney
yes
i
can
said
charles
holland
but
i
really
don't
know
what
they
are
or
what
it
can
matter
to
us
we
don't
expect
any
visitors
certainly
certainly
said
varney
i
am
somewhat
apprehensive
of
the
approach
of
strange
sounds
you
are
not
likely
to
be
disturbed
here
said
charles
indeed
i
thought
so
when
i
had
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
house
near
the
town
and
so
far
from
believing
it
was
likely
i
should
be
discovered
that
i
sat
on
the
house-top
while
the
mob
surrounded
it
did
you
not
hear
them
coming
i
did
and
yet
you
did
not
attempt
to
escape
from
them
no
i
could
not
persuade
them
i
was
not
there
save
by
my
utter
silence
i
allowed
them
to
come
too
close
to
leave
myself
time
to
escape--besides
i
could
hardly
persuade
myself
there
could
be
any
necessity
for
so
doing
it
was
fortunate
it
was
as
it
happened
afterwards
that
you
were
able
to
reach
the
wood
and
get
out
of
it
unperceived
by
the
mob
i
should
have
been
in
an
unfortunate
condition
had
i
been
in
their
hands
long
a
man
made
of
iron
would
not
be
able
to
resist
the
brutality
of
those
people
as
they
were
speaking
a
gig
with
two
men
drove
up
followed
by
one
on
horseback
they
stopped
at
the
garden-gate
and
then
tarried
to
consult
with
each
other
as
they
looked
at
the
house
what
can
they
want
i
wonder
inquired
henry
i
never
saw
them
before
nor
i
said
charles
holland
do
you
not
know
them
at
all
inquired
varney
no
replied
flora
i
never
saw
them
neither
can
i
imagine
what
is
their
object
in
coming
here
did
you
ever
see
them
before
inquired
henry
of
his
mother
who
held
up
her
hand
to
look
more
carefully
at
the
strangers
then
shaking
her
head
she
declared
she
had
never
seen
such
persons
as
those
i
dare
say
not
said
charles
holland
they
certainly
are
not
gentlemen
but
here
they
come
there
is
some
mistake
i
daresay--they
don't
want
to
come
here
as
they
spoke
the
two
strangers
got
down
after
picking
up
a
topcoat
they
had
let
fall
they
turned
round
and
deliberately
put
it
into
the
chaise
again
they
walked
up
the
path
to
the
door
at
which
they
knocked
the
door
was
opened
by
the
old
woman
when
the
two
men
entered
does
francis
beauchamp
live
here
eh
said
the
old
woman
who
was
a
little
deaf
and
she
put
her
hand
behind
her
ear
to
catch
the
sounds
more
distinctly--eh--who
did
you
say
sir
francis
varney
started
as
the
sounds
came
upon
his
ear
but
he
sat
still
an
attentive
listener
are
there
any
strangers
in
the
house
inquired
the
other
officer
impatiently
who
is
here
strangers
said
the
old
woman
you
are
the
only
strangers
that
i
have
seen
here
come
said
the
officer
to
his
companion
come
this
way
there
are
people
in
this
parlour
our
business
must
be
an
apology
for
any
rudeness
we
may
commit
as
he
spoke
he
stepped
by
the
old
woman
and
laying
his
hand
upon
the
handle
of
the
door
entered
the
apartment
at
the
same
time
looking
carefully
around
the
room
as
if
he
expected
some
one
ladies
said
the
stranger
with
an
off-hand
politeness
that
had
something
repulsive
in
it
though
it
was
meant
to
convey
a
notion
that
civility
was
intended
ladies
i
beg
pardon
for
intruding
but
i
am
looking
for
a
gentleman
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
soon
said
sir
francis
in
an
almost
imperceptible
whisper
what
is
the
object
of
this
intrusion
demanded
henry
bannerworth
rising
and
confronting
the
stranger
this
is
a
strange
introduction
yes
but
not
an
unusual
one
said
the
stranger
in
these
cases--being
unavoidable
at
the
least
sir
said
charles
holland
if
you
cannot
explain
quickly
your
business
here
we
will
proceed
to
take
those
measures
which
will
at
least
rid
ourselves
of
your
company
softly
sir
i
mean
no
offence--not
the
least
but
i
tell
you
i
do
not
come
for
any
purpose
that
is
at
all
consonant
to
my
wishes
i
am
a
bow-street
officer
in
the
execution
of
my
duty--excuse
me
therefore
whom
do
you
want
francis
beauchamp
and
from
the
peculiarity
of
the
appearance
of
this
individual
here
i
think
i
may
safely
request
the
pleasure
of
his
company
varney
now
rose
and
the
officer
made
a
rush
at
him
when
he
saw
him
do
so
saying--
surrender
in
the
king's
name
varney
however
paid
no
attention
to
that
but
rushed
past
throwing
his
chair
down
to
impede
the
officer
who
could
not
stay
himself
but
fell
over
it
while
varney
made
a
rush
towards
the
window
which
he
cleared
at
one
bound
and
crossing
the
road
was
lost
to
sight
in
a
few
seconds
in
the
trees
and
hedges
on
the
other
side
accidents
will
happen
said
the
officer
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
i
did
not
think
the
fellow
would
have
taken
the
window
in
that
manner
but
we
have
him
in
view
and
that
will
be
enough
in
heaven's
name
said
henry
explain
all
about
this
we
cannot
understand
one
word
of
it--i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
one
word
of
it
we
will
return
and
do
so
presently
said
the
officer
as
he
dashed
out
of
the
house
after
the
fugitive
at
a
rapid
and
reckless
speed
followed
by
his
companion
the
man
who
had
been
left
with
the
chaise
however
was
the
first
in
the
chase
seeing
an
escape
from
the
window
he
immediately
guessed
that
he
was
the
man
wanted
and
but
for
an
accident
he
would
have
met
varney
at
the
gate
for
as
he
was
getting
out
in
a
hurry
his
foot
became
entangled
with
the
reins
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
varney
at
the
same
moment
stepped
over
him
curse
his
infernal
impudence
and
d--n
these
reins
muttered
the
man
in
a
fury
at
the
accident
and
the
aggravating
circumstance
of
the
fugitive
walking
over
him
in
such
a
manner
and
so
coolly
too--it
was
vexing
the
man
however
quickly
released
himself
and
rushed
after
varney
across
the
road
and
kept
on
his
track
for
some
time
the
moon
was
still
rising
and
shed
but
a
gloomy
light
around
everything
was
almost
invisible
until
you
came
close
to
it
this
was
the
reason
why
varney
and
his
pursuer
met
with
several
severe
accidents--fumbles
and
hard
knocks
against
impediments
which
the
light
and
the
rapid
flight
they
were
taking
did
not
admit
of
their
avoiding
very
well
they
went
on
for
some
time
but
it
was
evident
varney
knew
the
place
best
and
could
avoid
what
the
man
could
not
and
that
was
the
trees
and
the
natural
impediments
of
the
ground
which
varney
was
acquainted
with
for
instance
at
full
speed
across
a
meadow
a
hollow
would
suddenly
present
itself
and
to
an
accustomed
eye
the
moonlight
might
enable
it
to
be
distinguished
at
a
glance
what
it
was
while
to
one
wholly
unaccustomed
to
it
the
hollow
would
often
look
like
a
hillock
by
such
a
light
this
varney
would
clear
at
a
bound
which
a
less
agile
and
heavier
person
would
step
into
lifting
up
his
leg
to
meet
an
impediment
when
he
would
find
it
come
down
suddenly
some
six
or
eight
inches
lower
than
he
anticipated
almost
dislocating
his
leg
and
neck
and
producing
a
corresponding
loss
of
breath
which
was
not
regained
by
the
muttered
curse
upon
such
a
country
where
the
places
were
so
uneven
having
come
to
one
of
these
places
which
was
a
little
more
perceptible
than
the
others
he
made
a
desperate
jump
but
he
jumped
into
the
middle
of
the
hole
with
such
force
that
he
sprained
his
ankle
besides
sinking
into
a
small
pond
that
was
almost
dry
being
overgrown
with
rushes
and
aquatic
plants
well
said
the
other
officer
coming
up--well
well
indeed
said
the
one
who
came
first
it's
anything
but
well
d--n
all
country
excursions
say
i
why
bob
you
don't
mean
to
say
as
how
you
are
caught
in
a
rat-trap
oh
you
be
d----d
i
am
ain't
i
yes
but
are
you
going
to
stop
there
or
coming
out
eh
you'll
catch
cold
i
have
sprained
my
ankle
well
it
ain't
well
i
tell
you
here
have
i
a
sprained
foot
and
my
wind
broken
for
a
month
at
least
why
were
you
not
quicker
if
you
had
been
sharper
we
should
have
had
the
gentleman
i'll
swear
i
tumbled
down
over
the
chair
and
he
got
out
of
the
window
and
i
come
out
of
the
door
well
i
got
entangled
in
the
reins
but
i
got
off
after
him
only
his
long
legs
carried
him
over
everything
i
tell
you
what
wilkinson
if
i
were
to
be
born
again
and
intended
to
be
a
runner
i
would
bespeak
a
pair
of
long
legs
why
because
i
should
be
able
to
get
along
better
you
have
no
idea
of
how
he
skimmed
along
the
ground
it
was
quite
beautiful
only
it
wasn't
good
to
follow
it
a
regular
sky
scraper
yes
or
something
of
that
sort
he
looked
like
a
patent
flying
shadow
well
get
up
and
lead
the
way
we'll
follow
you
i
dare
say
you
will--when
i
lead
the
way
back
there
for
as
to
going
out
yonder
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
i
want
supper
to-night
and
breakfast
to-morrow
morning
well
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
just
this
much
if
you
follow
any
farther
you'll
get
into
the
woods
and
there
you'll
be
going
round
and
round
like
a
squirrel
in
a
cage
without
being
able
to
get
out
and
you
will
there
get
none
of
the
good
things
included
under
the
head
of
those
meals
i
think
so
too
said
the
third
well
then
let's
go
back
we
needn't
run
though
it
might
be
as
well
to
do
so
it
would
be
anything
but
well
i
don't
gallop
back
depend
upon
it
the
three
men
now
slowly
returned
from
their
useless
chase
and
re-trod
the
way
they
had
passed
once
in
such
a
hurry
that
they
could
hardly
recognize
it
what
a
dreadful
bump
i
came
against
that
pole
standing
there
said
one
yes
and
i
came
against
a
hedge-stake
that
was
placed
so
as
the
moon
didn't
show
any
light
on
it
it
came
into
the
pit
of
my
stomach
i
never
recollect
such
a
pain
in
my
life
for
all
the
world
like
a
hot
coal
being
suddenly
and
forcibly
intruded
into
your
stomach
well
here's
the
road
i
must
go
up
to
the
house
where
i
started
him
from
i
promised
them
some
explanation
i
may
as
well
go
and
give
it
to
them
at
once
do
as
you
will
i
will
wait
with
the
horse
else
perhaps
that
beauchamp
will
again
return
and
steal
him
the
officer
who
had
first
entered
the
house
now
returned
to
the
bannerworths
saying
i
promised
you
i
would
give
you
some
explanation
as
to
what
you
have
witnessed
yes
said
henry
we
have
been
awaiting
your
return
with
some
anxiety
and
curiosity
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
i
am
as
we
are
all
in
perfect
ignorance
of
the
meaning
of
what
took
place
i
will
tell
you
the
person
whom
you
have
had
here
and
goes
by
the
name
of
varney
is
named
francis
beauchamp
indeed
are
you
assured
of
this
yes
perfectly
assured
of
it
i
have
it
in
my
warrant
to
apprehend
him
by
either
name
what
crime
had
he
been
guilty
of
i
will
tell
you
he
has
been
hanged
hanged
exclaimed
all
present
what
do
you
mean
by
that
added
henry
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
you
can
mean
by
saying
he
was
hanged
what
i
say
is
literally
true
pray
tell
us
all
about
it
we
are
much
interested
in
the
fact
go
on
sir
well
sir
then
i
believe
it
was
for
murder
that
francis
beauchamp
was
hanged--yes
hanged
a
common
execution
before
a
multitude
of
people
collected
to
witness
such
an
exhibition
good
god
exclaimed
henry
bannerworth
and
was--but
that
is
impossible
a
dead
man
come
to
life
again
you
must
be
amusing
yourself
at
our
expense
not
i
replied
the
officer
here
is
my
warrant
they
don't
make
these
out
in
a
joke
and
as
he
spoke
he
produced
the
warrant
when
it
was
evident
the
officer
spoke
the
truth
how
was
this
i
will
tell
you
sir
you
see
that
this
varney
was
a
regular
scamp
gamester
rogue
and
murderer
he
was
hanged
and
hung
about
the
usual
time
he
was
cut
down
and
the
body
was
given
to
some
one
for
dissection
when
a
surgeon
with
the
hangman
one
montgomery
succeeded
in
restoring
the
criminal
to
life
but
i
always
thought
they
broke
the
neck
when
they
were
hanged
the
weight
of
the
body
would
alone
do
that
oh
dear
no
sir
said
the
officer
that
is
one
of
the
common
every
day
mistakes
they
don't
break
the
neck
once
in
twenty
times
indeed
no
they
die
of
suffocation
only
this
man
beauchamp
was
hanged
thus
but
they
contrived
to
restore
him
and
then
he
assumed
a
new
name
and
left
london
but
how
came
you
to
know
all
this
oh
it
came
to
us
as
many
things
usually
do
in
a
very
extraordinary
manner
and
in
a
manner
that
appears
most
singular
and
out
of
the
way
but
such
it
was
the
executioner
who
was
the
means
of
his
being
restored
or
one
of
them
wished
to
turn
him
to
account
and
used
to
draw
a
yearly
sum
of
money
from
him
as
hush
money
to
induce
them
to
keep
the
secret
else
the
fact
of
his
having
escaped
punishment
would
subject
him
to
a
repetition
of
the
same
punishment
when
of
course
a
little
more
care
would
be
taken
that
he
did
not
escape
a
second
time
i
dare
say
not
well
you
see
varney
or
rather
beauchamp
was
to
pay
a
heavy
sum
to
this
man
to
keep
him
quiet
and
to
permit
him
to
enjoy
the
life
he
had
so
strangely
become
possessed
of
i
see
said
holland
well
this
man
montgomery
had
always
some
kind
of
suspicion
that
varney
would
murder
him
murder
him
and
be
the
means
of
saving
his
life
surely
he
could
not
be
so
bad
as
that
why
you
see
sir
this
hangman
drew
a
heavy
sum
yearly
from
him
thus
making
him
only
a
mine
of
wealth
to
himself
this
no
doubt
would
rankle
in
the
other's
heart
to
think
he
should
be
so
beset
and
hold
life
upon
such
terms
i
see
now
yes
and
then
came
the
consideration
that
he
did
not
do
it
from
any
good
motive
merely
a
selfish
one
and
he
was
consequently
under
no
obligation
to
him
for
what
he
had
done
besides
self-preservation
might
urge
him
on
and
tell
him
to
do
the
deed
however
that
may
be
montgomery
dreaded
it
and
was
resolved
to
punish
the
deed
if
he
could
not
prevent
it
he
therefore
left
general
orders
with
his
wife
whenever
he
went
on
a
journey
to
varney
if
he
should
be
gone
beyond
a
certain
time
she
was
to
open
a
certain
drawer
and
take
out
a
sealed
packet
to
the
magistrate
at
the
chief
office
who
would
attend
to
it
he
has
been
missing
and
his
wife
did
as
she
was
desired
and
now
we
have
found
what
he
there
mentioned
to
be
true
but
now
sir
i
have
satisfied
you
and
explained
to
you
why
we
intruded
upon
you
we
must
now
leave
and
seek
for
him
elsewhere
it
is
most
extraordinary
and
that
is
the
reason
why
his
complexion
is
so
singular
very
likely
they
poured
out
some
wine
which
was
handed
to
the
officers
who
drank
and
then
quitted
the
house
leaving
the
inmates
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
from
surprise
and
amazement
at
what
they
had
heard
from
the
officers
there
was
a
strange
feeling
came
over
them
when
they
recollected
the
many
occurrences
they
had
witnessed
and
even
the
explanation
of
the
officers
it
seemed
as
if
some
mist
had
enveloped
objects
and
rendered
them
indistinct
but
which
was
fast
rising
and
they
were
becoming
plainer
and
more
distinct
every
moment
in
which
they
were
regarded
there
was
a
long
pause
and
flora
was
about
to
speak
when
suddenly
there
came
the
sound
of
a
footstep
across
the
garden
it
was
slow
but
unsteady
and
paused
between
whiles
until
it
came
close
beneath
the
windows
they
remained
silent
and
then
some
one
was
heard
to
climb
up
the
rails
of
the
veranda
and
then
the
curtains
were
thrust
aside
but
not
till
after
the
person
outside
had
paused
to
ascertain
who
was
there
then
the
curtains
were
opened
and
the
visage
of
sir
francis
varney
appeared
much
altered
in
fact
completely
worn
and
exhausted
it
was
useless
to
deny
it
but
he
looked
ghastly--terrific
his
singular
visage
was
as
pallid
as
death
his
eyes
almost
protruding
his
mouth
opened
and
his
breathing
short
and
laboured
in
the
extreme
he
climbed
over
with
much
difficulty
and
staggered
into
the
room
and
would
have
spoken
but
he
could
not
befell
senseless
upon
the
floor
utterly
exhausted
and
motionless
there
was
a
long
pause
and
each
one
present
looked
at
each
other
and
then
they
gazed
upon
the
inanimate
body
of
sir
francis
varney
which
lay
supine
and
senseless
in
the
middle
of
the
floor




the
importance
of
the
document
said
to
be
on
the
dead
body
was
such
that
it
would
admit
of
no
delay
before
it
was
obtained
and
the
party
determined
that
it
should
be
commenced
instanter
lost
time
would
be
an
object
to
them
too
much
haste
could
hardly
be
made
and
now
came
the
question
of
should
it
be
to-night
or
not
certainly
said
henry
bannerworth
the
sooner
we
can
get
it
the
sooner
all
doubt
and
distress
will
be
at
an
end
and
considering
the
turn
of
events
that
will
be
desirable
for
all
our
sakes
besides
we
know
not
what
unlucky
accident
may
happen
to
deprive
us
of
what
is
so
necessary
there
can
be
none
said
mr
chillingworth
but
there
is
this
to
be
said
this
has
been
such
an
eventful
history
that
i
cannot
say
what
might
or
what
might
not
happen
we
may
as
well
go
this
very
night
said
charles
holland
i
give
my
vote
for
an
immediate
exhumation
of
the
body
the
night
is
somewhat
stormy
but
nothing
more
the
moon
is
up
and
there
will
be
plenty
of
light
and
rain
said
the
doctor
little
or
none
said
charles
holland
a
few
gusts
of
wind
now
and
then
drive
a
few
heavy
plashes
of
rain
against
the
windows
and
that
gives
a
fearful
sound
which
is
in
fret
nothing
when
you
have
to
encounter
it
but
you
will
go
doctor
yes
most
certainly
we
must
have
some
tools
those
may
be
had
from
the
garden
said
henry
tools
for
the
exhumation
you
mean
yes
pickaxe
mattocks
and
a
crowbar
a
lantern
and
so
forth
said
the
doctor
you
see
i
am
at
home
in
this
the
fact
is
i
have
had
more
than
one
affair
of
this
kind
on
my
hands
before
now
and
whilst
a
student
i
have
had
more
than
one
adventure
of
a
strange
character
i
dare
say
doctor
said
charles
holland
you
have
some
sad
pranks
to
answer
for
you
don't
think
of
it
then
only
when
you
find
them
accumulated
in
a
heap
so
that
you
shall
not
be
able
to
escape
them
because
they
come
over
your
senses
when
you
sleep
at
night
no
no
said
chillingworth
you
are
mistaken
in
that
i
have
long
since
settled
all
my
accounts
of
that
nature
besides
i
never
took
a
dead
body
out
of
a
grave
but
in
the
name
of
science
and
never
for
my
own
profit
seeing
i
never
sold
one
in
my
life
or
got
anything
by
it
that
is
not
the
fact
said
henry
you
know
doctor
you
improved
your
own
talents
and
knowledge
yes
yes
i
did
well
but
you
profited
by
such
improvements
well
granted
i
did
how
much
more
did
the
public
not
benefit
then
said
the
doctor
with
a
smile
ah
well
we
won't
argue
the
question
said
charles
only
it
strikes
me
that
the
doctor
could
never
have
been
a
doctor
if
he
had
not
determined
upon
following
a
profession
there
may
be
a
little
truth
in
that
said
chillingworth
but
now
we
had
better
quit
the
house
and
make
the
best
of
our
way
to
the
spot
where
the
unfortunate
man
lies
buried
in
his
unhallowed
grave
come
with
me
into
the
garden
said
henry
bannerworth
we
shall
there
be
able
to
suit
ourselves
to
what
is
required
i
have
a
couple
of
lanterns
one
is
enough
said
chillingworth
we
had
better
not
burden
ourselves
more
than
we
are
obliged
to
do
and
we
shall
find
enough
to
do
with
the
tools
yes
they
are
not
light
and
the
distance
is
by
far
too
great
to
make
walking
agreeable
and
easy
the
wind
blows
strong
and
the
rain
appears
to
be
coming
up
afresh
and
by
the
time
we
have
done
we
shall
find
the
ground
will
become
slippy
and
bad
for
walking
can
we
have
a
conveyance
no
no
said
the
doctor
we
could
but
we
must
trouble
the
turnpike
man
besides
there
is
a
shorter
way
across
some
fields
which
will
be
better
and
safer
well
well
said
charles
holland
i
do
not
mind
which
way
it
is
as
long
as
you
are
satisfied
yourselves
the
horse
and
cart
would
have
settled
it
all
better
and
done
it
quicker
besides
carrying
the
tools
very
true
very
true
said
the
doctor
all
that
is
not
without
its
weight
and
you
shall
choose
which
way
you
would
have
it
done
for
my
part
i
am
persuaded
the
expedition
on
foot
is
to
be
preferred
for
two
reasons
and
what
are
they
the
first
is
we
cannot
obtain
a
horse
and
cart
without
giving
some
detail
as
to
what
you
want
it
for
which
is
awkward
on
account
of
the
hour
moreover
you
could
not
get
one
at
this
moment
in
time
that
ought
to
settle
the
argument
said
henry
bannerworth
an
impossibility
under
the
circumstances
at
once
is
a
clincher
and
one
that
may
be
allowed
to
have
some
weight
you
may
say
that
said
charles
besides
which
you
must
go
a
greater
distance
and
that
too
along
the
main
road
which
is
objectionable
then
we
are
agreed
said
charles
holland
and
the
sooner
we
are
off
the
better
the
night
grows
more
and
more
gloomy
every
hour
and
more
inclement
it
will
serve
our
purpose
the
better
said
chillingworth
what
we
do
we
may
as
well
do
now
come
with
me
to
the
garden
said
henry
and
we
will
take
the
tools
we
can
go
out
the
back
way
that
will
preclude
any
observation
being
made
they
all
now
left
the
apartment
wrapped
up
in
great
overcoats
to
secure
themselves
against
the
weather
and
also
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
themselves
from
any
chance
passenger
in
the
garden
they
found
the
tools
they
required
and
having
chosen
them
they
took
a
lantern
with
the
mean
of
getting
a
light
when
they
got
to
their
journey's
end
which
they
would
do
in
less
than
an
hour
after
having
duly
inspected
the
state
of
their
efficiency
they
started
away
on
their
expedition
the
night
had
turned
gloomy
and
windy
heavy
driving
masses
of
clouds
obscured
the
moon
which
only
now
and
then
was
to
be
seen
when
the
clouds
permitted
her
to
peep
out
at
the
same
time
there
were
many
drifting
showers
which
lasted
but
a
few
minutes
and
then
the
clouds
were
carried
forwards
by
some
sudden
gust
of
wind
so
that
altogether
it
was
a
most
uncomfortable
night
as
well
could
be
imagined
however
there
was
no
time
to
lose
and
under
all
circumstances
they
could
not
have
chosen
a
better
night
for
their
purpose
than
the
one
they
had
indeed
they
could
not
desire
another
night
to
be
out
on
such
a
purpose
they
spoke
not
while
they
were
within
sight
of
the
houses
though
at
the
distance
of
many
yards
and
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
noise
through
the
trees
that
would
have
carried
their
voices
past
every
object
however
close
but
they
would
make
assurance
doubly
sure
i
think
we
are
fairly
away
now
said
henry
from
all
fear
of
being
recognized
to
be
sure
you
are
who
would
recognize
us
now
if
we
were
met
no
one
i
should
think
not
and
moreover
there
would
be
but
small
chance
of
any
evil
coming
from
it
even
if
it
were
to
happen
that
we
were
to
be
seen
and
known
nobody
knows
what
we
are
going
to
do
and
if
they
did
there
is
no
illegality
in
the
question
certainly
not
but
we
wish
the
matter
to
be
quite
secret
therefore
we
don't
wish
to
be
seen
by
any
one
while
upon
this
adventure
exactly
said
chillingworth
and
if
you'll
follow
my
guidance
you
shall
meet
nobody
we
will
trust
you
most
worthy
doctor
what
have
you
to
say
for
our
confidence
that
you
will
find
it
is
not
misplaced
just
as
the
doctor
had
uttered
the
last
sound
there
came
a
hearty
laugh
upon
the
air
which
indeed
sounded
but
a
few
paces
in
advance
of
them
the
wind
blew
towards
them
and
would
therefore
cause
the
sounds
to
come
to
them
but
not
to
go
away
in
the
direction
they
were
going
the
whole
party
came
to
a
sudden
stand
still
there
was
something
so
strange
in
hearing
a
laugh
at
that
moment
especially
as
chillingworth
was
at
that
moment
boasting
of
his
knowledge
of
the
ground
and
the
certainty
of
their
meeting
no
one
what
is
that
inquired
henry
some
one
laughing
i
think
said
chillingworth
of
that
there
can
be
little
or
no
doubt
said
charles
holland
and
as
people
do
not
usually
laugh
by
themselves
so
heartily
it
may
be
presumed
there
are
at
least
two
no
doubt
of
it
and
moreover
their
purpose
cannot
be
a
very
good
one
at
this
hour
of
the
night
and
of
such
a
night
too
i
think
we
had
better
be
cautious
hush
follow
me
silently
said
henry
as
he
spoke
he
moved
cautiously
from
the
spot
where
he
stood
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
followed
by
the
whole
party
until
they
came
to
the
hedge
which
skirted
a
lane
in
which
were
seated
three
men
they
had
a
sort
of
tent
erected
and
that
was
hung
upon
a
part
of
the
hedge
which
was
to
windward
of
them
so
that
it
sheltered
them
from
wind
and
rain
henry
and
chillingworth
both
peeped
over
the
bank
and
saw
them
seated
beneath
this
kind
of
canopy
they
were
shabby
gipsy-looking
men
who
might
be
something
else--sheep-stealers
or
horse-stealers
in
fact
anything
even
to
beggars
i
say
jack
said
one
it's
no
bottle
to-night
no
there's
nobody
about
these
parts
to-night
we
are
safe
and
so
are
they
exactly
besides
you
see
those
who
do
happen
to
be
out
are
not
worth
talking
to
no
cash
none
not
enough
to
pay
turnpike
for
a
walking-slick
at
the
most
besides
it
does
us
no
good
to
take
a
few
shillings
from
a
poor
wretch
who
has
more
in
family
than
he
has
shillings
in
pocket
ay
you
are
right
quite
right
i
don't
like
it
myself
i
don't
besides
that
there's
fresh
risk
in
every
man
you
stop
and
these
poor
fellows
will
fight
hard
for
a
few
shillings
and
there
is
no
knowing
what
an
unlucky
blow
may
do
for
a
man
that
is
very
true
has
anything
been
done
to-night
nothing
said
one
only
three
half
crowns
said
the
other
that
is
the
extent
of
the
common
purse
to-night
and
i
said
the
third
i
have
got
a
bottle
of
bad
gin
from
the
cat
and
cabbage-stump
how
did
you
manage
it
why
this
way
i
went
in
and
had
some
beer
and
you
know
i
can
give
a
long
yarn
when
i
want
but
it
wants
only
a
little
care
to
deceive
these
knowing
countrymen
so
i
talked
and
talked
until
they
got
quite
chatty
and
then
i
put
the
gin
in
my
pocket
good
well
then
the
loaf
and
beef
i
took
out
of
the
safe
as
i
came
by
and
i
dare
say
they
know
they
have
lost
it
by
this
time
yes
and
so
do
we
i
expect
the
gin
will
help
to
digest
the
beef
so
we
mustn't
complain
of
the
goods
no
give
us
another
glass
jim
jim
held
the
glass
towards
him
when
the
doctor
animated
by
the
spirit
of
mischief
took
a
good
sized
pebble
and
threw
it
into
the
glass
smashing
it
and
spilling
the
contents
in
a
moment
there
was
a
change
of
scene
the
men
were
all
terrified
and
started
to
their
feet
while
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
caused
their
light
to
go
out
at
the
same
time
their
tent-cloth
was
thrown
down
by
the
wind
and
fell
across
their
heads
come
along
said
the
doctor
there
was
no
need
of
saying
so
for
in
a
moment
the
three
were
as
if
animated
by
one
spirit
and
away
they
scudded
across
the
fields
with
the
speed
of
a
race
horse
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
better
than
half
a
mile
away
from
the
spot
in
absence
of
all
authentic
information
said
the
doctor
speaking
as
well
as
he
could
and
blowing
prodigiously
between
each
word
as
though
he
were
fetching
breath
all
the
way
from
his
heels
i
think
we
may
conclude
we
are
safe
from
them
we
ought
to
thank
our
stars
we
came
across
them
in
the
way
we
did
but
doctor
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
induced
you
to
make
such
a
noise
to
frighten
them
in
fact
and
to
tell
them
some
one
was
about
they
were
too
much
terrified
to
tell
whether
it
was
one
or
fifty
by
this
time
they
are
out
of
the
county
they
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
and
perhaps
we
may
meet
them
on
the
road
where
we
are
going
thinking
it
a
rare
lonely
spot
where
they
can
hide
and
no
chance
of
their
being
found
out
illustration
no
said
the
doctor
they
will
not
go
to
such
a
place
it
has
by
far
too
bad
a
name
for
even
such
men
as
those
to
go
near
much
less
stop
in
i
can
hardly
think
that
said
charles
holland
for
these
fellows
are
too
terrified
for
their
personal
safety
to
think
of
the
superstitious
fears
with
which
a
place
may
be
regarded
and
these
men
in
such
a
place
as
the
one
you
speak
of
they
will
be
at
home
well
well
rather
than
be
done
we
must
fight
for
it
and
when
you
come
to
consider
we
have
one
pick
and
two
shovels
we
shall
be
in
full
force
well
said
doctor
how
far
have
we
to
go
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
they
pursued
their
way
through
the
fields
and
under
the
hedge-rows
until
they
came
to
a
gate
where
they
stopped
awhile
and
began
to
consult
and
to
listen
a
few
yards
up
here
on
the
left
said
the
doctor
i
know
the
spot
besides
there
is
a
particular
mark
now
then
are
you
all
ready
yes
all
here
said
the
doctor
pointing
out
the
marks
by
which
the
spot
might
be
recognized
here
is
the
spot
and
i
think
we
shall
not
be
half
a
foot
out
of
our
reckoning
then
let
us
begin
instanter
said
henry
as
he
seized
hold
of
the
pickaxe
and
began
to
loosen
the
earth
by
means
of
the
sharp
end
that
will
do
for
the
present
said
chillingworth
now
let
me
and
charles
take
a
turn
with
our
shovels
and
you
will
get
on
again
presently
throw
the
earth
up
on
the
bank
in
one
heap
so
that
we
can
put
it
on
again
without
attracting
any
attention
to
the
spot
by
its
being
left
in
clods
and
uneven
exactly
said
henry
else
the
body
will
be
discovered
they
began
to
shovel
away
and
continued
to
do
so
after
it
had
been
picked
up
working
alternately
until
at
length
charles
stuck
his
pick-axe
into
something
soft
and
upon
pulling
it
up
he
found
it
was
the
body
a
dreadful
odour
now
arose
from
the
spot
and
they
were
at
no
loss
to
tell
where
the
body
lay
the
pick-axe
had
stuck
into
the
deceased's
ribs
and
clothing
and
thus
lifted
it
out
of
its
place
here
it
is
said
the
doctor
but
i
needn't
tell
you
that
the
charnel-house
smell
is
enough
to
convince
you
of
the
fact
of
where
it
is
i
think
so
just
show
a
light
upon
the
subject
doctor
and
then
we
can
see
what
we
are
about--do
you
mind
doctor--you
have
the
management
of
the
lantern
you
know
yes
yes
said
chillingworth
i
see
you
have
it--don't
be
in
a
hurry
but
do
things
deliberately
and
coolly
whatever
you
do--you
will
not
be
so
liable
to
make
mistakes
or
to
leave
anything
undone
there
will
be
nothing
of
any
use
to
you
here
doctor
in
the
way
of
dissection
for
the
flesh
is
one
mass
of
decay
what
a
horrible
sight
to
be
sure
it
is
but
hasten
the
search
well
i
must
though
to
confess
the
truth
i'd
sooner
handle
anything
than
this
it
is
not
the
most
pleasant
thing
in
the
world
for
there
is
no
knowing
what
may
be
the
result--what
creeping
thing
has
made
a
home
of
it
don't
mention
anything
about
it
henry
and
charles
holland
now
began
to
search
the
pockets
of
the
clothes
of
the
dead
body
in
one
of
which
was
something
hard
that
felt
like
a
parcel
what
have
you
got
there
said
chillingworth
as
he
held
his
lantern
up
so
that
the
light
fell
upon
the
ghastly
object
that
they
were
handling
i
think
it
is
the
prize
said
charles
holland
but
we
have
not
got
it
out
yet
though
i
dare
say
it
won't
be
long
first
if
this
wind
will
but
hold
good
for
about
five
minutes
and
keep
the
stench
down
they
now
tore
open
the
packet
and
pulled
out
the
papers
which
appeared
to
have
been
secreted
upon
his
person
be
sure
there
are
none
on
any
other
part
of
the
body
said
chillingworth
because
what
you
do
now
you
had
better
do
well
and
leave
nothing
to
after
thought
because
it
is
frequently
impracticable
the
advice
is
good
said
henry
who
made
a
second
search
but
found
nothing
we
had
better
re-bury
him
said
the
doctor
it
had
better
be
done
cleanly
well
it
is
a
sad
hole
for
a
last
resting-place
and
yet
i
do
not
know
that
it
matters--it
is
all
a
matter
of
taste--the
fashion
of
the
class
or
the
particular
custom
of
the
country
there
was
but
little
to
be
said
against
such
an
argument
though
the
custom
of
the
age
had
caused
them
to
look
upon
it
more
as
a
matter
of
feeling
than
in
such
a
philosophical
sense
as
that
in
which
the
doctor
had
put
it
well
there
he
is
now--shovel
the
earth
in
charles
said
henry
bannerworth
as
he
himself
set
the
example
which
was
speedily
and
vigorously
followed
by
charles
holland
when
they
were
not
long
before
the
earth
was
thrown
in
and
covered
up
with
care
and
trodden
down
so
that
it
should
not
appear
to
be
moved
this
will
do
i
think
said
henry
yes
it
is
not
quite
the
same
but
i
dare
say
no
one
will
try
to
make
any
discoveries
in
this
place
besides
if
the
rain
continues
to
come
down
very
heavy
why
it
will
wash
much
of
it
away
and
it
will
make
it
look
all
alike
there
was
little
inducement
to
hover
about
the
spot
but
henry
could
not
forbear
holding
up
the
papers
to
the
light
of
the
lantern
to
ascertain
what
they
were
are
they
all
right
inquired
the
doctor
yes
replied
henry
yes
the
dearbrook
estate
oh
yes
they
are
the
papers
i
am
in
want
of
it
is
singularly
fortunate
at
least
to
be
successful
in
securing
them
i
am
very
glad
a
living
person
has
possession
of
them
else
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
have
obtained
it
from
them
so
it
would
but
now
homeward
is
the
word
doctor
and
on
my
word
there
is
reason
to
be
glad
for
the
rain
is
coming
on
very
fast
now
and
there
is
no
moon
at
all--we
had
better
step
out
they
did
for
the
three
walked
as
fast
as
the
nature
of
the
soil
would
permit
them
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
tells
what
became
of
the
second
vampyre
who
sought
varney
illustration
we
left
the
hungarian
nobleman
swimming
down
the
stream
he
swam
slowly
and
used
but
little
exertion
in
doing
so
he
appeared
to
use
his
hands
only
as
a
means
of
assistance
the
stream
carried
him
onwards
and
he
aided
himself
so
far
that
he
kept
the
middle
of
the
stream
and
floated
along
where
the
stream
was
broad
and
shallow
it
sometimes
left
him
a
moment
or
two
without
being
strong
enough
to
carry
him
onwards
then
he
would
pause
as
if
gaining
strength
and
finally
he
would
when
he
had
rested
and
the
water
came
a
little
faster
and
lifted
him
make
a
desperate
plunge
and
swim
forward
until
he
again
came
in
deep
water
and
then
he
went
slowly
along
with
the
stream
as
he
supported
himself
it
was
strange
thus
to
see
a
man
going
down
slowly
and
without
any
effort
whatever
passing
through
shade
and
through
moonlight--now
lost
in
the
shadow
of
the
tall
trees
and
now
emerging
into
that
part
of
the
stream
which
ran
through
meadows
and
cornfields
until
the
stream
widened
and
then
at
length
a
ferry-house
was
to
be
seen
in
the
distance
then
came
the
ferryman
out
of
his
hut
to
look
upon
the
beautiful
moonlight
scene
it
was
cold
but
pure
and
brilliantly
light
the
chaste
moon
was
sailing
through
the
heavens
and
the
stars
diminished
in
their
lustre
by
the
power
of
the
luminous
goddess
of
night
there
was
a
small
cottage--true
it
was
somewhat
larger
than
was
generally
supposed
by
any
casual
observer
who
might
look
at
it
the
place
was
rambling
and
built
chiefly
of
wood
but
in
it
lived
the
ferryman
his
wife
and
family
among
these
was
a
young
girl
about
seventeen
years
of
age
but
at
the
same
time
very
beautiful
they
had
been
preparing
their
supper
and
the
ferryman
himself
walked
out
to
look
at
the
river
and
the
shadows
of
the
tall
trees
that
stood
on
the
hill
opposite
while
thus
employed
he
heard
a
plashing
in
the
water
and
on
turning
towards
the
quarter
whence
the
sound
proceeded
for
a
few
yards
he
came
to
the
spot
where
he
saw
the
stranger
struggling
in
the
stream
good
god
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
saw
the
struggle
continued
good
god
he
will
sink
and
drown
as
he
spoke
he
jumped
into
his
boat
and
pushed
it
off
for
the
purpose
of
stopping
the
descent
of
the
body
down
the
stream
and
in
a
moment
or
two
it
came
near
to
him
he
muttered--
come
come--he
tries
to
swim
life
is
not
gone
yet--he
will
do
now
if
i
can
catch
hold
of
him
swimming
with
one's
face
under
the
stream
doesn't
say
much
for
his
skill
though
it
may
account
for
the
fact
that
he
don't
cry
out
as
the
drowning
man
neared
the
ferryman
held
on
by
the
boat-hook
and
stooping
down
he
seized
the
drowning
man
by
the
hair
of
the
head
and
then
paused
after
a
time
he
lifted
him
up
and
placed
him
across
the
edge
of
the
boat
and
then
with
some
struggling
of
his
own
he
was
rolled
over
into
the
boat
you
are
safe
now
muttered
the
ferryman
the
stranger
spoke
not
but
sat
or
leaned
against
the
boat's
head
sobbing
and
catching
at
his
breath
and
spitting
off
his
stomach
the
water
it
might
be
presumed
he
had
swallowed
the
ferryman
put
back
to
the
shore
when
he
paused
and
secured
his
boat
and
then
pulled
the
stranger
out
saying--
do
you
feel
any
better
now
yes
said
the
stranger
i
feel
i
am
living--thanks
to
you
my
good
friend
i
owe
you
my
life
you
are
welcome
to
that
replied
the
ferryman
it
costs
me
nothing
and
as
for
my
little
trouble
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
of
that
when
a
fellow-being's
life
was
in
danger
you
have
behaved
very
well--very
well
and
i
can
do
little
more
now
than
thank
you
for
i
have
been
robbed
of
all
i
possessed
about
me
at
the
moment
oh
you
have
been
robbed
aye
truly
i
have
and
have
been
thrown
into
the
water
and
thus
i
have
been
nearly
murdered
it
is
lucky
you
escaped
from
them
without
further
injury
said
the
ferryman
but
come
in
doors
you
must
be
mad
to
stand
here
in
the
cold
thank
you
your
hospitality
is
great
and
at
this
moment
of
the
greatest
importance
to
me
such
as
we
have
said
the
honest
ferryman
you
shall
be
welcome
to
come
in--come
in
he
turned
round
and
led
the
way
to
the
house
which
he
entered
saying--as
he
opened
the
small
door
that
led
into
the
main
apartment
where
all
the
family
were
assembled
waiting
for
the
almost
only
meal
they
had
had
that
day
for
the
ferryman
had
not
the
means
before
the
sun
had
set
of
sending
for
food
and
then
it
was
a
long
way
before
it
could
be
found
and
then
it
was
late
before
they
could
get
it--
wife
we
have
a
stranger
to
sleep
with
us
to-night
and
for
whom
we
must
prepare
a
bed
a
stranger
echoed
the
wife--a
stranger
and
we
so
poor
yes
one
whose
life
i
have
saved
and
who
was
nearly
drowned
we
cannot
refuse
hospitality
upon
such
an
occasion
as
that
you
know
wife
the
wife
looked
at
the
stranger
as
he
entered
the
room
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
i
am
sorry
he
said
to
intrude
upon
you
but
i
will
make
you
amends
for
the
interruption
and
inconvenience
i
may
cause
you
but
it
is
too
late
to
apply
elsewhere
and
yet
i
am
doubtful
if
there
were
whether
i
could
go
any
further
no
no
said
the
ferryman
i
am
sure
a
man
who
has
been
beaten
and
robbed
and
thrown
into
a
rapid
and
in
some
parts
deep
stream
is
not
fit
to
travel
at
this
time
of
night
you
are
lonely
about
here
said
the
stranger
as
he
shivered
by
the
fire
yes
rather
but
we
are
used
to
it
you
have
a
family
too
that
must
help
to
lighten
the
hours
away
and
help
you
over
the
long
evenings
so
you
may
think
stranger
and
at
times
so
it
is
but
when
food
runs
short
it
is
a
long
while
to
daylight
before
any
more
money
can
be
had
to
be
sure
we
have
fish
in
the
river
and
we
have
what
we
can
grow
in
the
garden
but
these
are
not
all
the
wants
that
we
feel
and
those
others
are
sometimes
pinching
however
we
are
thankful
for
what
we
have
and
complain
but
little
when
we
can
get
no
more
but
sometimes
we
do
repine--though
i
cannot
say
we
ought--but
i
am
merely
relating
the
fact
whether
it
be
right
or
wrong
exactly
how
old
is
your
daughter
she
is
seventeen
come
allhallow's
eve
that
is
not
far
hence
said
the
stranger
i
hope
i
may
be
in
this
part
of
the
country--and
i
think
i
shall--i
will
on
that
eve
pay
you
a
visit
not
one
on
which
i
shall
be
a
burden
to
you
but
one
more
useful
to
you
and
more
consonant
to
my
character
the
future
will
tell
us
all
about
that
said
the
ferryman
at
present
we
will
see
what
we
can
do
without
complaining
or
taxing
anybody
the
stranger
and
the
ferryman
sat
conversing
for
some
time
before
the
fire
and
then
the
latter
pointed
out
to
him
which
was
his
bed--one
made
up
near
the
fire
for
the
sake
of
its
warmth
and
then
the
ferryman
retired
to
the
next
room
a
place
which
was
merely
divided
by
an
imperfect
partition
however
they
all
fell
soundly
asleep
the
hours
on
that
day
had
been
longer
than
usual
there
was
not
that
buoyancy
of
spirit
when
they
retired
they
fell
off
into
a
heavy
deep
slumber
from
this
they
were
suddenly
aroused
by
loud
cries
and
piercing
screams
from
one
of
the
family
so
loud
and
shrill
were
the
cries
that
they
all
started
up
terrified
and
bewildered
beyond
measure
unable
to
apply
their
faculties
to
any
one
object
help--help
father--help
shrieked
the
voice
of
the
young
girl
whom
we
have
before
noticed
the
ferryman
jumped
up
and
rushed
to
the
spot
where
his
daughter
lay
fanny
he
said--fanny
what
ails
thee--what
ails
thee
tell
me
my
dear
child
oh
she
exclaimed
almost
choked--oh
father
are
we
all
alone
i
am
terrified
what
ails
thee--what
ails
thee
tell
me
what
caused
you
to
scream
out
in
such
a
manner
i--i--that
is
i
father
thought--but
no
i
am
sure
it
was
reality
where
is
the
stranger
a
light--a
light
shouted
the
fisherman
in
another
moment
a
light
was
brought
him
and
he
discovered
the
stranger
reclining
in
his
bed
but
awake
and
looking
around
him
as
if
in
the
utmost
amazement
what
has
happened
he
said--what
has
happened
that
is
more
than
i
know
as
yet
the
man
replied
come
fanny
he
added
tell
me
what
it
is
you
fear
what
caused
you
to
scream
out
in
that
dreadful
manner
oh
father--the
vampyre
great
god
what
do
you
mean
fanny
by
that
i
hardly
know
father
i
was
fast
asleep
when
i
thought
i
felt
something
at
my
throat
but
being
very
sound
asleep
i
did
not
immediately
awake
presently
i
felt
the
sharp
pang
of
teeth
being
driven
into
the
flesh
of
my
neck--i
awoke
and
found
the
vampyre
at
his
repast
oh
god
oh
god
what
shall
i
do
stay
my
child
let
us
examine
the
wound
said
the
fisherman
and
he
held
the
candle
to
the
spot
where
the
vampyre's
teeth
had
been
applied
there
sure
enough
were
teeth
marks
such
as
a
human
being's
would
make
were
they
applied
but
no
blood
had
been
drawn
therefrom
come
come
fanny
so
far
by
divine
providence
you
are
not
injured
another
moment
and
the
mischief
would
have
been
done
entire
and
complete
and
you
would
have
been
his
victim
then
turning
to
the
stranger
he
said--
you
have
had
some
hand
in
this
no
human
being
but
you
could
come
into
this
place
the
cottage
door
is
secured
you
must
be
the
vampyre
i
yes
who
else
could
i--as
heaven's
my
judge--but
there
it's
useless
to
speak
of
it
i
have
not
been
out
of
my
bed
in
this
place
dark
as
it
is
and
less
used
to
darkness
than
you
i
could
not
even
find
my
way
about--it
is
impossible
get
out
of
your
bed
and
let
me
feel
said
the
ferryman
peremptorily--get
out
and
i
will
soon
tell
the
stranger
arose
and
began
to
dress
himself
and
the
ferryman
immediately
felt
the
bed
on
which
he
had
been
lying
but
it
was
ice
cold--so
cold
that
he
started
upon
his
legs
in
an
instant
exclaiming
with
vehemence--
it
is
you
vile
wretch
that
has
attempted
to
steal
into
the
cottage
of
the
poor
man
and
then
to
rob
him
of
his
only
child
and
that
child
of
her
heart's
blood
base
ingrate
my
friend
you
are
wrong
entirely
wrong
i
am
not
the
creature
you
believe
me
i
have
slept
and
slept
soundly
and
awoke
not
until
your
daughter
screamed
scoundrel--liar--base
wretch
you
shall
not
remain
alive
to
injure
those
who
have
but
one
life
to
lose
as
he
spoke
the
ferryman
made
a
desperate
rush
at
the
vampyre
and
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
a
violent
struggle
ensued
in
which
the
superior
strength
of
the
ferryman
prevailed
and
he
brought
his
antagonist
to
the
earth
at
the
same
time
bestowing
upon
him
some
desperate
blows
thou
shall
go
to
the
same
element
from
which
i
took
thee
said
the
ferryman
and
there
swim
or
sink
as
thou
wilt
until
some
one
shall
drag
thee
ashore
and
when
they
do
may
they
have
a
better
return
than
i
as
he
spoke
he
dragged
along
the
stranger
by
main
force
until
they
came
to
the
bank
of
the
river
and
then
pausing
to
observe
the
deepest
part
he
said--
here
then
you
shall
go
the
vampyre
struggled
and
endeavoured
to
speak
but
he
could
not
the
grasp
at
his
throat
prevented
all
attempts
at
speech
and
then
with
a
sudden
exertion
of
his
strength
the
ferryman
lifted
the
stranger
up
and
heaved
him
some
distance
into
the
river
then
in
deep
water
sank
the
body
the
ferryman
watched
for
some
moments
and
farther
down
the
stream
he
saw
the
body
again
rise
upon
the
current
and
struggling
slightly
as
for
life--now
whirled
around
and
around
and
then
carried
forward
with
the
utmost
velocity
this
continued
as
far
as
the
moonlight
enabled
the
ferryman
to
see
and
then
with
a
slow
step
and
clouded
brow
he
returned
to
his
cottage
which
he
entered
and
closed
the
door
dr
chillingworth
at
the
hall--the
encounter
of
mystery--the
conflict--the
rescue
and
the
picture
illustration
there
have
been
many
events
that
have
passed
rapidly
in
this
our
narrative
but
more
have
yet
to
come
before
we
can
arrive
at
that
point
which
will
clear
up
much
that
appears
to
be
most
mysterious
and
unaccountable
doctor
chillingworth
but
ill
satisfied
with
the
events
that
had
yet
taken
place
determined
once
more
upon
visiting
the
hall
and
there
to
attempt
a
discovery
of
something
respecting
the
mysterious
apartment
in
which
so
much
has
already
taken
place
he
communicated
his
design
to
no
one
he
resolved
to
prosecute
the
inquiry
alone
he
determined
to
go
there
and
await
whatever
might
turn
up
in
the
shape
of
events
he
would
not
for
once
take
any
companion
such
adventures
were
often
best
prosecuted
alone--they
were
most
easily
brought
to
something
like
an
explanatory
position
one
person
can
often
consider
matters
more
coolly
than
more
at
all
events
there
is
more
secrecy
than
under
any
other
circumstances
perhaps
this
often
is
of
greater
consequence
than
many
others
and
moreover
when
there
is
more
than
one
something
is
usually
overdone
where
one
adventurous
individual
will
rather
draw
back
in
a
pursuit
more
than
one
would
induce
them
to
urge
each
other
on
in
fact
one
in
such
a
case
could
act
the
part
of
a
spy--a
secret
observer
and
in
that
case
can
catch
people
at
times
when
they
could
not
under
any
other
circumstances
be
caught
or
observed
at
all
i
will
go
he
muttered
and
should
i
be
compelled
to
run
away
again
why
nobody
knows
anything
about
it
and
nobody
will
laugh
at
me
this
was
all
very
well
but
mr
chillingworth
was
not
the
man
to
run
away
without
sufficient
cause
but
there
was
so
much
mystery
in
all
this
that
he
felt
much
interested
in
the
issue
of
the
affair
but
this
issue
he
could
not
command
at
the
same
time
he
was
determined
to
sit
and
watch
and
thus
become
certain
that
either
something
or
nothing
was
to
take
place
even
the
knowledge
of
that
much--that
some
inexplicable
action
was
still
going
on--was
far
preferable
to
the
uncertainty
of
not
knowing
whether
what
had
once
been
going
on
was
still
so
or
not
because
if
it
had
ceased
it
was
probable
that
nothing
more
would
ever
be
known
concerning
it
and
the
mystery
would
still
be
a
mystery
to
the
end
of
time
it
shall
be
fathomed
if
there
be
any
possibility
of
its
being
discovered
muttered
chillingworth
who
would
have
thought
that
so
quiet
and
orderly
a
spot
as
this
our
quiet
village
would
have
suffered
so
much
commotion
and
disturbance
far
from
every
cause
of
noise
and
strife
it
is
quite
as
great
a
matter
of
mystery
as
the
vampyre
business
itself
i
have
been
so
mixed
up
in
this
business
that
i
must
go
through
with
it
by
the
way
of
the
mysteries
the
greatest
that
i
have
met
with
is
the
fact
of
the
vampyre
having
anything
to
do
with
so
quiet
a
family
as
the
bannerworths
mr
chillingworth
pondered
over
the
thought
but
yet
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
it
in
no
way
tended
to
elucidate
anything
connected
with
the
affair
and
it
was
much
too
strange
and
singular
in
all
its
parts
to
be
submitted
to
any
process
of
thought
with
any
hope
of
coming
to
anything
like
a
conclusion
upon
the
subject--that
must
remain
until
some
facts
were
ascertained
and
to
obtain
them
mr
chillingworth
now
determined
to
try
this
was
precisely
what
was
most
desirable
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
while
things
remained
in
the
present
state
of
uncertainty
there
would
be
much
more
of
mystery
than
could
ever
be
brought
to
light
one
or
two
circumstances
cleared
up
the
minor
ones
would
follow
in
the
same
train
and
they
would
be
explained
by
the
others
and
if
ever
that
happy
state
of
things
were
to
come
about
why
then
there
would
be
a
perfect
calm
in
the
town
as
mr
chillingworth
was
going
along
he
thought
he
observed
two
men
sitting
inside
a
hedge
close
to
a
hay-rick
and
thinking
neither
of
them
had
any
business
there
he
determined
to
listen
to
their
conversation
and
ascertain
if
it
had
any
evil
tendency
or
whether
it
concerned
the
late
event
having
approached
near
the
gate
and
they
being
on
the
other
side
he
got
over
without
any
noise
and
unperceived
by
either
of
them
crept
close
up
to
them
so
you
haven't
long
come
from
sea
no
i
have
just
landed
how
is
it
you
have
thrown
aside
your
seaman's
clothes
and
taken
to
these
just
to
escape
being
found
out
found
out
what
do
you
mean
by
that
have
you
been
up
to
anything
yes
i
have
jack
i
have
been
up
to
something
worse
luck
to
me
but
i'm
not
to
be
blamed
either
what
is
it
all
about
inquired
his
companion
i
always
thought
you
were
such
a
steady-going
old
file
that
there
was
no
going
out
of
the
even
path
with
you
nor
would
there
have
been
but
for
one
simple
circumstance
what
was
that
i
will
tell
you
jack--i
will
tell
you
you
will
never
betray
me
i
am
sure
never
by
heavens
well
then
listen--it
was
this
i
had
been
some
time
aboard
our
vessel
i
had
sailed
before
but
the
captain
never
showed
any
signs
of
being
a
bad
man
and
i
was
willing
enough
to
sail
with
him
again
he
knew
i
was
engaged
to
a
young
woman
in
this
country
and
that
i
was
willing
to
work
hard
to
save
money
to
make
up
a
comfortable
home
for
us
both
and
that
i
would
not
sail
again
but
that
i
intended
to
remain
ashore
and
make
up
my
mind
to
a
shore
life
well
you
would
have
a
house
then
exactly
and
that's
what
i
wished
to
do
well
i
made
a
small
venture
in
the
cargo
and
thought
by
so
doing
that
i
should
have
a
chance
of
realizing
a
sum
of
money
that
would
put
us
both
in
a
comfortable
line
of
business
well
we
went
on
very
smoothly
until
we
were
coming
back
we
had
disposed
of
the
cargo
and
i
had
received
some
money
and
this
seemed
to
cause
our
captain
to
hate
me
because
i
had
been
successful
but
i
thought
there
was
something
else
in
it
than
that
but
i
could
not
tell
what
it
was
that
made
him
so
intolerably
cross
and
tyrannous
well
i
found
out
at
length
he
knew
my
intended
wife
he
knew
her
very
well
and
at
the
same
time
he
made
every
effort
he
could
to
induce
me
to
commit
some
act
of
disobedience
and
insubordination
but
i
would
not
for
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
trying
all
he
could
to
prevent
my
doing
my
duty
with
anything
like
comfort
however
i
learned
the
cause
of
all
this
afterwards
it
was
told
me
by
one
of
the
crew
'bill'
said
my
mate
'look
out
for
yourself'
'what's
in
the
wind'
said
i
'only
the
captain
has
made
a
dead
set
at
you
and
you'll
be
a
lucky
man
if
you
escape'
'what's
it
all
about'
said
i
'i
cannot
understand
what
he
means
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
i
don't
see
why
i
should
suddenly
be
treated
in
this
way'
'it's
all
about
your
girl
bill'
'indeed'
said
i
'what
can
that
have
to
do
with
the
captain
he
knows
nothing
of
her'
'oh
yes
he
does'
he
said
'if
it
were
not
for
you
he
would
have
the
girl
himself'
'i
see
now'
said
i
'ay
and
so
can
a
blind
man
if
you
open
his
eyes
but
he
wants
to
make
you
do
wrong--to
goad
you
on
to
do
something
that
will
give
him
the
power
of
disgracing
you
and
perhaps
of
punishing
you'
'he
won't
do
that'
said
i
'i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
bill
for
to
my
mind
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
go
the
whole
length
against
you
i
can't
make
it
out
unless
he
wishes
you
were
dead'
'i
dare
say
he
does'
said
i
'but
i
will
take
care
i
will
live
to
exact
a
reckoning
when
he
comes
ashore'
'that
is
the
best
and
when
we
are
paid
off
bill
if
you
will
take
it
out
of
him
and
pay
him
off
why
i
don't
care
if
i
lend
you
a
hand'
'we'll
say
more
about
that
dick'
said
i
'when
we
get
ashore
and
are
paid
off
if
we
are
overheard
now
it
will
be
said
that
we
are
conspiring
or
committing
mutiny
or
something
of
that
sort'
'you
are
right
bill'
he
said--'you
are
right
we'll
say
no
more
about
this
now
but
you
may
reckon
upon
me
when
we
are
no
longer
under
his
orders'
'then
there's
no
danger
you
know'
well
we
said
nothing
about
this
but
i
thought
of
it
and
i
had
cause
enough
too
to
think
of
it
for
each
day
the
captain
grew
more
and
more
tyrannous
and
brutal
i
knew
not
what
to
do
but
kept
my
resolution
of
doing
my
duty
in
spite
of
all
he
could
do
though
i
don't
mind
admitting
i
had
more
than
one
mind
to
kill
him
and
myself
afterwards
however
i
contrived
to
hold
out
for
another
week
or
two
and
then
we
came
into
port
and
were
released
from
his
tyranny
i
got
paid
off
and
then
i
met
my
messmate
and
we
had
some
talk
about
the
matter
'the
worst
of
it
is'
said
i
'we
shall
have
some
difficulty
to
catch
him
and
if
we
can
i'll
be
sworn
we
shall
give
him
enough
to
last
him
for
at
least
a
voyage
or
two'
'he
ought
to
have
it
smart'
said
my
messmate
'and
i
know
where
he
is
to
be
found'
'do
you--at
what
hour'
'late
at
night
when
he
may
be
met
with
as
he
comes
from
a
house
where
he
spends
his
evenings
'that
will
be
the
best
time
in
the
world
when
we
shall
have
less
interference
than
at
any
other
time
in
the
day
but
we'll
have
a
turn
to-night
if
you
will
be
with
me
as
he
will
be
able
to
make
too
good
a
defence
to
one
it
will
be
a
fight
and
not
a
chastisement'
'it
will
i
will
be
with
you
you
know
where
to
meet
me
i
shall
be
at
the
old
spot
at
the
usual
time
and
then
we
will
go'
we
parted
and
in
the
evening
we
both
went
together
and
sought
the
place
where
we
should
find
him
out
and
set
upon
him
to
advantage
he
was
nearly
two
hours
before
he
came
but
when
he
did
come
we
saluted
him
with
a
rap
on
the
head
that
made
him
hold
his
tongue
and
then
we
set
to
and
gave
him
such
a
tremendous
drubbing
that
we
left
him
insensible
but
he
was
soon
taken
away
by
some
watchmen
and
we
heard
that
he
was
doing
well
but
he
was
dreadfully
beaten
indeed
it
would
take
him
some
weeks
before
he
could
be
about
in
his
duties
he
was
fearfully
enraged
and
offered
fifty
pounds
reward
to
any
one
who
could
give
him
information
as
to
who
it
was
that
assaulted
him
i
believe
he
had
a
pretty
good
notion
of
who
it
was
but
he
could
not
swear
to
me
but
still
seeing
he
was
busying
himself
too
much
about
me
i
at
once
walked
away
and
went
on
my
way
to
another
part
of
the
country
to
get
married
ay
and
to
get
into
business
then
things
are
not
quite
so
bad
as
i
thought
for
at
first
no--no
not
so
bad
but
what
they
might
have
been
worse
a
great
deal
only
i
cannot
go
to
sea
any
more
that's
quite
certain
you
needn't
regret
that
i
don't
know
why
not
know
are
you
not
going
to
be
married--ain't
that
much
better
i
can't
say
replied
the
sailor
there's
no
knowing
how
my
bargain
may
turn
out
if
she
does
well
why
then
the
cruising
is
over
but
nothing
short
of
that
will
satisfy
me
for
if
my
wife
is
at
all
not
what
i
wish
her
to
be
why
i
shall
be
off
to
sea
i
don't
blame
you
either
i
would
do
so
too
if
it
were
possible
but
you
see
we
can't
do
so
well
on
land
as
you
do
at
sea
we
can
be
followed
about
from
pillar
to
post
and
no
bounds
set
to
our
persecution
that's
true
enough
said
the
other
we
can
cut
and
run
when
we
have
had
enough
of
it
however
i
must
get
to
the
village
as
i
shall
sleep
there
to-night
if
i
find
my
quarters
comfortable
enough
come
on
then
at
once
said
his
companion
it's
getting
dark
now
and
you
have
no
time
to
lose
these
two
now
got
up
and
walked
away
towards
the
village
and
chillingworth
arose
also
and
pursued
his
way
towards
the
hall
while
he
remarked
to
himself--
well--well
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
affair
at
all
events
by-the-bye
i
wonder
what
amount
of
females
are
deserted
in
the
navy
they
certainly
have
an
advantage
over
landsmen
in
the
respect
of
being
tied
to
tiresome
partners
they
can
at
least
for
a
season
get
a
release
from
their
troubles
and
be
free
at
sea
however
mr
chillingworth
got
to
the
hall
and
unobserved
for
he
had
been
especially
careful
not
to
be
seen
he
had
watched
on
all
sides
and
no
signs
of
a
solitary
human
being
had
he
seen
that
could
in
any
way
make
the
slightest
observation
upon
him
indeed
he
had
sheltered
himself
from
observation
at
every
point
of
his
road
especially
so
when
near
bannerworth
hall
where
there
were
plenty
of
corners
to
enable
him
to
do
so
and
when
he
arrived
there
he
entered
at
the
usual
spot
and
then
sat
down
a
few
moments
in
the
bower
i
will
not
sit
here
he
muttered
i
will
go
and
have
a
watch
at
that
mysterious
picture
there
is
the
centre
of
attraction
be
it
what
it
may
as
he
spoke
he
arose
and
walked
into
the
house
and
entered
the
same
apartment
which
has
been
so
often
mentioned
to
the
reader
here
he
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
full
before
the
picture
and
began
to
contemplate
it
well
for
a
good
likeness
i
cannot
say
i
ever
saw
anything
more
unprepossessing
i
am
sure
such
a
countenance
as
that
could
never
have
won
a
female
heart
surely
it
is
more
calculated
to
terrify
the
imagination
than
to
soothe
the
affections
of
the
timid
and
shrinking
female
however
i
will
have
an
inspection
of
the
picture
and
see
if
i
can
make
anything
of
it
as
he
spoke
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
picture
with
the
intention
of
removing
it
when
it
suddenly
was
thrust
open
and
a
man
stepped
down
the
doctor
was
for
a
moment
completely
staggered
it
was
so
utterly
unexpected
and
he
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
in
the
first
emotion
of
his
surprise
but
this
soon
passed
by
and
he
prepared
to
close
with
his
antagonist
which
he
did
without
speaking
a
word
there
was
a
fair
struggle
for
more
than
two
or
three
minutes
during
which
the
doctor
struggled
and
fought
most
manfully
but
it
was
evident
that
mr
chillingworth
had
met
with
a
man
who
was
his
superior
in
point
of
strength
for
he
not
only
withstood
the
utmost
force
that
chillingworth
could
bring
against
him
but
maintained
himself
and
turned
his
strength
against
the
doctor
chillingworth
panted
with
exertion
and
found
himself
gradually
losing
ground
and
was
upon
the
point
of
being
thrown
down
at
the
mercy
of
his
adversary
who
appeared
to
be
inclined
to
take
all
advantages
of
him
when
an
occurrence
happened
that
altered
the
state
of
affairs
altogether
while
they
were
struggling
the
doctor
borne
partially
to
the
earth--but
yet
struggling
suddenly
his
antagonist
released
his
hold
and
staggered
back
a
few
paces
there
you
swab--take
that
i
am
yard-arm
and
yard-arm
with
you
you
piratical-looking
craft--you
lubberly
buccaneering
son
of
a
fish-fag
before
however
jack
pringle
for
it
was
he
who
came
so
opportunely
to
the
rescue
of
doctor
chillingworth
could
find
time
to
finish
the
sentence
he
found
himself
assailed
by
the
very
man
who
but
a
minute
before
he
had
as
he
thought
placed
hors
de
combat
illustration
a
desperate
fight
ensued
and
the
stranger
made
the
greatest
efforts
to
escape
with
the
picture
but
found
he
could
not
get
off
without
a
desperate
struggle
he
was
at
length
compelled
to
relinquish
the
hope
of
carrying
that
off
for
both
mr
chillingworth
and
jack
pringle
were
engaged
hand
to
hand
but
the
stranger
struck
jack
so
heavy
a
blow
on
the
head
that
made
him
reel
a
few
yards
and
then
he
escaped
through
the
window
leaving
jack
and
mr
chillingworth
masters
of
the
field
but
by
no
means
unscathed
by
the
conflict
in
which
they
had
been
engaged
the
grand
consultation
broken
up
by
mrs
chillingworth
and
the
disappearance
of
varney
illustration
remarkable
was
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
the
circumstances
of
the
bannerworth
family
from
a
state
of
great
despondency
and
indeed
absolute
poverty
they
had
suddenly
risen
to
comfort
and
independence
it
seemed
as
if
the
clouds
that
had
obscured
their
destiny
had
now
with
one
accord
dissipated
and
that
a
brighter
day
was
dawning
not
only
had
the
circumstances
of
mental
terror
which
had
surrounded
them
given
way
in
a
great
measure
to
the
light
of
truth
and
reflection
but
those
pecuniary
distresses
which
had
pressed
upon
them
for
a
time
were
likewise
passing
away
and
it
seemed
probable
that
they
would
be
in
a
prosperous
condition
the
acquisition
of
the
title
deeds
of
the
estate
which
they
thought
had
passed
away
from
the
family
for
ever
became
to
them
in
their
present
circumstances
an
immense
acquisition
and
brought
to
their
minds
a
feeling
of
great
contentment
many
persons
in
their
situation
would
have
been
extremely
satisfied
at
having
secured
so
strong
an
interest
in
the
mind
of
the
old
admiral
who
was
very
wealthy
and
who
from
what
he
had
already
said
and
done
no
doubt
fully
intended
to
provide
handsomely
for
the
bannerworth
family
and
not
only
had
they
this
to
look
forward
to
if
they
had
chosen
to
regard
it
as
an
advantage
but
they
knew
that
by
the
marriage
of
flora
with
charles
holland
she
would
have
a
fortune
at
her
disposal
while
he
charles
would
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
demur
at
any
reasonable
amount
of
it
being
lavished
upon
her
mother
and
her
brothers
but
all
this
did
not
suit
the
high
and
independent
spirit
of
henry
bannerworth
he
was
one
who
would
rather
have
eaten
the
dust
that
he
procured
for
himself
by
some
meritorious
exertion
than
have
feasted
on
the
most
delicate
viands
placed
before
him
from
the
resources
of
another
but
now
that
he
knew
this
small
estate
the
title
deeds
of
which
had
been
so
singularly
obtained
had
once
really
belonged
to
the
family
but
had
been
risked
and
lost
at
the
gaming-table
he
had
no
earthly
scruple
in
calling
such
property
again
his
own
as
to
the
large
sum
of
money
which
sir
francis
varney
in
his
confessions
had
declared
to
have
found
its
way
into
the
possession
of
marmaduke
bannerworth
henry
did
not
expect
and
scarcely
wished
to
become
possessed
of
wealth
through
so
tainted
a
source
no
he
said
to
himself
frequently
no--i
care
not
if
that
wealth
be
never
forthcoming
which
was
so
badly
got
possession
of
let
it
sink
into
the
earth
if
indeed
it
be
buried
there
or
let
it
rot
in
some
unknown
corner
of
the
old
mansion
i
care
not
for
it
in
this
view
of
the
case
he
was
not
alone
for
a
family
more
unselfish
or
who
cared
so
little
for
money
could
scarcely
have
been
found
but
admiral
bell
and
charles
holland
argued
now
that
they
had
a
right
to
the
amount
of
money
which
marmaduke
bannerworth
had
hidden
somewhere
and
the
old
admiral
reasoned
upon
it
rather
ingeniously
for
he
said--
i
suppose
you
don't
mean
to
dispute
that
the
money
belongs
to
somebody
and
in
that
case
i
should
like
to
know
who
else
it
belonged
to
if
not
to
you
how
do
you
get
over
that
master
henry
i
don't
attempt
to
get
over
it
at
all
said
henry
all
i
say
is
that
i
do
dislike
the
whole
circumstances
connected
with
it
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
come
by
and
now
that
we
have
a
small
independence
i
hope
it
will
not
be
found
but
admiral
we
are
going
to
hold
a
family
consultation
as
to
what
we
shall
do
and
what
is
to
become
of
varney
he
has
convinced
me
of
his
relationship
to
our
family
and
although
his
conduct
has
certainly
been
extremely
equivocal
he
has
made
all
the
amends
in
his
power
and
now
as
he
is
getting
old
i
do
not
like
to
throw
him
upon
the
wide
world
for
a
subsistence
you
don't
contemplate
said
the
admiral
letting
him
remain
with
you
do
you
no
that
would
be
objectionable
for
a
variety
of
reasons
and
i
could
not
think
of
it
for
a
moment
i
should
think
not
the
idea
of
sitting
down
to
breakfast
dinner
tea
and
supper
with
a
vampyre
and
taking
your
grog
with
a
fellow
that
sucks
other
people's
blood
really
admiral
you
do
not
really
still
cling
to
the
idea
that
sir
francis
varney
is
a
vampyre
i
really
don't
know
he
clings
to
it
himself
that's
all
i
can
say
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances
i
might
as
well
give
him
the
benefit
of
his
own
proposition
and
suppose
that
he
is
a
vampyre
really
uncle
said
charles
holland
i
did
think
that
you
had
discarded
the
notion
did
you
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
and
it
ain't
so
desirable
to
be
a
vampyre
i
am
sure
that
any
one
should
pretend
to
it
who
is
not
therefore
i
take
the
fellow
upon
his
own
showing
he
is
a
vampyre
in
his
own
opinion
and
so
i
don't
see
for
the
life
of
me
why
he
should
not
be
so
in
ours
well
said
henry
waving
all
that
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
circumstances
seem
to
have
thrown
him
completely
at
our
mercy
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
and
what
is
to
become
of
him
for
the
future
i'll
tell
you
what
i'll
do
said
the
admiral
if
he
were
ten
times
a
vampyre
there
is
some
good
in
the
fellow
and
i
will
give
him
enough
to
live
upon
if
he
will
go
to
america
and
spend
it
they
will
take
good
care
there
that
he
sucks
no
blood
out
of
them
for
although
an
american
would
always
rather
lose
a
drop
of
blood
than
a
dollar
they
keep
a
pretty
sharp
look
out
upon
both
the
proposal
can
be
made
to
him
said
henry
at
all
events
it
is
one
which
i
don't
dislike
and
probably
one
that
he
would
embrace
at
once
because
he
seems
to
me
to
have
completely
done
with
ambition
and
to
have
abandoned
those
projects
concerning
which
at
one
time
he
took
such
a
world
of
trouble
don't
you
trust
to
that
said
the
admiral
what's
bred
in
the
bone
don't
so
easily
get
out
of
the
flesh
and
once
or
twice
when
master
varney
has
been
talking
i
have
seen
those
odd
looking
eyes
of
his
flash
up
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
quite
ready
to
begin
his
old
capers
again
and
alarm
the
whole
country
side
i
must
confess
said
charles
holland
that
i
myself
have
had
the
impression
once
or
twice
that
varney
was
only
subdued
for
a
time
and
that
with
a
proper
amount
of
provocation
he
would
become
again
a
very
serious
fellow
and
to
the
full
as
troublesome
as
he
has
been
do
you
doubt
his
sincerity
said
henry
no
i
do
not
do
that
henry
i
think
varney
fully
means
what
he
says
but
i
think
at
the
same
time
that
he
has
for
so
long
lead
a
strange
wild
and
reckless
life
that
he
will
find
it
very
far
from
easy
if
indeed
possible
to
shake
off
his
old
habits
and
settle
down
quietly
if
not
to
say
comfortably
i
regret
said
henry
that
you
have
such
an
impression
but
while
i
do
so
i
cannot
help
admitting
that
it
is
to
a
considerable
extent
no
more
than
a
reasonable
one
and
perhaps
after
all
my
expectation
that
varney
will
give
us
no
more
trouble
only
amounts
to
a
hope
that
he
will
not
do
so
and
nothing
more
but
let
us
consider
there
seems
to
be
some
slight
difference
of
opinion
among
us
as
to
whether
we
should
take
up
our
residence
at
this
new
house
of
ours
which
we
did
not
know
we
owned
at
dearbrook
or
proceed
to
london
and
there
establish
ourselves
or
again
return
to
bannerworth
hall
and
by
a
judicious
expenditure
of
some
money
make
that
a
more
habitable
place
than
it
has
been
for
the
last
twenty
years
now
i'll
tell
you
what
said
the
admiral
i
would
do
it's
quite
out
of
the
question
for
any
body
to
live
long
unless
they
see
a
ship
don't
you
think
so
miss
flora
why
how
can
you
ask
flora
such
a
question
uncle
said
charles
holland
when
you
know
she
don't
care
a
straw
about
ships
and
only
looks
upon
admirals
as
natural
curiosities
excepting
one
said
flora
and
he
is
an
admiral
who
is
natural
but
no
curiosity
unless
it
be
that
you
can
call
him
such
because
he
is
so
just
and
generous
and
as
for
ships
who
can
help
admiring
them
and
if
admiral
bell
proposes
that
we
live
in
some
pleasant
marine
villa
by
the
sea-coast
he
shall
have
my
vote
and
interest
for
the
proceeding
bravo
huzza
cried
the
admiral
i
tell
you
what
it
is
master
charley--you
horse
marine--i
have
a
great
mind
to
cut
you
out
and
have
miss
flora
myself
don't
uncle
said
charles
that
would
be
so
very
cruel
after
she
has
promised
me
so
faithfully
how
do
you
suppose
i
should
like
it
come
now
be
merciful
at
this
moment
and
before
any
one
could
make
another
remark
there
came
rather
a
sharp
ring
at
the
garden-gate
bell
and
henry
exclaimed--
that's
mr
chillingworth
and
i
am
glad
he
has
come
in
time
to
join
our
conference
his
advice
is
always
valuable
and
moreover
i
rather
think
he
will
bring
us
some
news
worth
the
hearing
the
one
servant
who
they
had
to
wait
upon
them
looked
into
the
room
and
said--if
you
please
here
is
mrs
chillingworth
mistress
you
mean
mr
no
it
is
mrs
chillingworth
and
her
baby
the
devil
said
the
admiral
what
can
she
want
i'll
come
and
let
you
know
said
mrs
chillingworth
what
i
want
and
she
darted
into
the
room
past
the
servant
i'll
soon
let
you
know
you
great
sea
crab
i
want
my
husband
and
what
with
your
vampyre
and
one
thing
and
another
i
haven't
had
him
at
home
an
hour
for
the
past
three
weeks
what
am
i
to
do
there
is
all
his
patients
getting
well
as
fast
as
they
can
without
him
and
when
they
find
that
out
do
you
think
they
will
take
any
more
filthy
physic
no
to
be
sure
not
people
ain't
such
fools
as
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
i'll
tell
you
what
we
will
do
ma'am
said
the
admiral
we'll
all
get
ill
at
once
on
purpose
to
oblige
ye
and
i'll
begin
by
having
the
measles
you
are
an
old
porpoise
and
i
believe
it
all
owing
to
you
that
my
husband
neglects
his
wife
and
family
what's
vampyres
to
him
i
should
like
to
know
that
he
should
go
troubling
about
them
i
never
heard
of
vampyres
taking
draughts
and
pills
no
nor
any
body
else
that
had
the
sense
of
a
goose
said
the
admiral
but
if
it's
your
husband
you
want
ma'am
it's
no
use
your
looking
for
him
here
for
here
he
is
not
then
where
is
he
he
is
running
after
some
of
your
beastly
vampyres
somewhere
i'll
be
bound
and
you
know
where
to
send
for
him
then
you
are
mistaken
for
indeed
we
don't
we
want
him
ourselves
ma'am
and
can't
find
him--that's
the
fact
it's
all
very
well
talking
sir
but
if
you
were
a
married
woman
with
a
family
about
you
and
the
last
at
the
breast
you'd
feel
very
different
from
what
you
do
now
i'm
d----d
if
i
don't
suppose
i
should
said
the
admiral
but
as
for
the
last
ma'am
i'd
soon
settle
that
i'd
wring
its
neck
and
shove
it
overboard
you
would
you
brute
it's
quite
clear
to
me
you
never
had
a
child
of
your
own
mrs
chillingworth
said
henry
i
think
you
have
no
right
to
complain
to
us
of
your
domestic
affairs
where
your
husband
goes
and
what
he
does
is
at
his
own
will
and
pleasure
and
really
i
don't
see
that
we
are
to
be
made
answerable
as
to
whether
he
is
at
home
or
abroad
to
say
nothing
of
the
bad
taste--and
bad
taste
it
most
certainly
is
of
talking
of
your
private
affairs
to
other
people
oh
dear
said
mrs
chillingworth
that's
your
idea
is
it
you
no-whiskered
puppy
really
madam
i
cannot
see
what
my
being
destitute
of
whiskers
has
to
do
with
the
affair
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
my
opinion
is
quite
as
good
without
them
as
with
them
i
will
speak
said
flora
to
the
doctor
when
i
see
him
will
you
miss
doll's-eyes
oh
dear
me
you'll
speak
to
the
doctor
will
you
what
on
earth
do
you
want
said
henry
for
your
husband's
sake
whom
we
all
respect
we
wish
to
treat
you
with
every
imaginable
civility
but
we
tell
you
candidly
that
he
is
not
here
and
therefore
we
cannot
conceive
what
more
you
can
require
of
us
oh
it's
a
row
said
the
admiral
that's
what
she
wants--woman
like
d----d
a
bit
do
they
care
what
it's
about
as
long
as
there's
a
disturbance
and
now
ma'am
will
you
sit
down
and
have
a
glass
of
grog
no
i
will
not
sit
down
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
look
upon
this
place
as
a
den
full
of
snakes
and
reptiles
that's
my
opinion
so
i'll
not
stay
any
longer
but
wishing
that
great
judgments
may
some
day
come
home
to
you
all
and
that
you
may
know
what
it
is
to
be
a
mother
with
five
babies
and
one
at
the
breast
i
despise
you
all
and
leave
you
so
saying
mrs
chillingworth
walked
from
the
place
feeling
herself
highly
hurt
and
offended
at
what
had
ensued
and
they
were
compelled
to
let
her
go
just
as
she
was
without
giving
her
any
information
for
they
had
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
serious
disturbance
she
had
created
on
a
former
occasion
when
she
had
actually
headed
a
mob
for
the
purpose
of
hunting
out
varney
the
vampyre
from
bannerworth
hall
and
putting
an
end
consequently
as
she
considered
to
that
set
of
circumstances
which
kept
the
doctor
so
much
from
his
house
to
the
great
detriment
of
a
not
very
extensive
practice
after
all
said
flora
mrs
chillingworth
although
she
is
not
the
most
refined
person
in
the
world
is
to
be
pitied
what
cried
the
admiral
miss
doll's-eyes
are
you
taking
her
part
oh
that's
nothing
she
may
call
me
what
she
likes
i
believe
she
is
a
good
wife
to
the
doctor
said
henry
notwithstanding
his
little
eccentricities
but
suppose
we
now
at
once
make
the
proposal
we
were
thinking
of
to
sir
francis
varney
and
so
get
him
to
leave
england
as
quickly
as
possible
and
put
an
end
to
the
possibility
of
his
being
any
more
trouble
to
anybody
agreed--agreed
it's
the
best
thing
that
can
be
done
and
it
will
be
something
gained
to
get
his
consent
at
once
i'll
run
up
stairs
to
him
said
charles
and
call
him
down
at
once
i
scarcely
doubt
for
a
moment
his
acquiescence
in
the
proposal
charles
holland
rose
and
ran
up
the
little
staircase
of
the
cottage
to
the
room
which
by
the
kindness
of
the
bannerworth
family
had
been
devoted
to
the
use
of
varney
he
had
not
been
gone
above
two
minutes
when
he
returned
hastily
with
a
small
scrap
of
paper
in
his
hand
which
he
laid
before
henry
saying--
there
what
think
you
of
that
henry
upon
taking
up
the
paper
saw
written
upon
it
the
words--
the
farewell
of
varney
the
vampyre
he
is
gone
said
charles
holland
the
room
is
vacant
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
had
removed
his
hat
and
cloak
and
all
that
belonged
to
him
he's
off
and
at
so
short
a
warning
and
in
so
abrupt
a
manner
that
i
fear
the
worst
what
can
you
fear
i
scarcely
know
what
but
we
have
a
right
to
fear
everything
and
anything
from
his
most
inexplicable
being
whose
whole
conduct
has
been
of
that
mysterious
nature
as
to
put
him
past
all
calculation
as
regards
his
motives
his
objects
or
his
actions
i
must
confess
that
i
would
have
hailed
his
departure
from
england
with
feelings
of
satisfaction
but
what
he
means
now
by
this
strange
manoeuvre
heaven
and
his
own
singular
intellect
can
alone
divine
i
must
confess
said
flora
i
should
not
at
all
have
thought
this
of
varney
it
seems
to
me
as
if
something
new
must
have
occurred
to
him
altogether
i
do
not
feel
any
alarm
concerning
his
actions
as
regards
us
i
am
convinced
of
his
sincerity
and
therefore
do
not
view
with
sensations
of
uneasiness
this
new
circumstance
which
appears
at
present
so
inexplicable
but
for
which
we
may
yet
get
some
explanation
that
will
be
satisfactory
to
us
all
i
cannot
conceive
said
henry
what
new
circumstances
could
have
occurred
to
produce
this
effect
upon
varney
things
remain
just
as
they
were
and
after
all
situated
as
he
is
if
any
change
had
taken
place
in
matters
out
of
doors
i
do
not
see
how
he
could
become
acquainted
with
them
so
that
his
leaving
must
have
been
a
matter
of
mere
calculation
or
of
impulse
at
the
moment--heaven
knows
which--but
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
actual
information
because
it
is
quite
evident
he
could
not
get
it
it
is
rather
strange
said
charles
holland
that
just
as
we
were
speculating
upon
the
probability
of
his
doing
something
of
this
sort
he
should
suddenly
do
it
and
in
this
singular
manner
too
oh
said
the
old
admiral
i
told
you
i
saw
his
eye
that
was
enough
for
me
i
knew
he
would
do
something
as
well
as
i
know
a
mainmast
from
a
chain
cable
he
can't
help
it
it's
in
the
nature
of
the
beast
and
that's
all
you
can
say
about
it
the
misadventure
of
the
doctor
with
the
picture
the
situation
of
dr
chillingworth
and
jack
pringle
was
not
of
that
character
that
permitted
much
conversation
or
even
congratulation
they
were
victors
it
was
true
and
yet
they
had
but
little
to
boast
of
besides
the
victory
victory
is
a
great
thing
it
is
like
a
gilded
coat
it
bewilders
and
dazzles
nobody
can
say
much
when
you
are
victorious
what
a
sound
and
yet
how
much
misery
is
there
not
hidden
beneath
it
this
victory
of
the
worthy
doctor
and
his
aid
amounted
to
this
they
were
as
they
were
before
without
being
any
better
but
much
the
worse
seeing
they
were
so
much
buffetted
that
they
could
hardly
speak
but
sat
for
some
moments
opposite
to
each
other
gasping
for
breath
and
staring
each
other
in
the
face
without
speaking
the
moonlight
came
in
through
the
window
and
fell
upon
the
floor
and
there
were
no
sounds
that
came
to
disturb
the
stillness
of
the
scene
nor
any
object
that
moved
to
cast
a
shadow
upon
the
floor
all
was
still
and
motionless
save
the
two
victors
who
were
much
distressed
and
bruised
well
said
jack
pringle
with
a
hearty
execration
as
he
wiped
his
face
with
the
back
of
his
hand
saving
your
presence
doctor
we
are
masters
of
the
field
doctor
but
it's
plaguey
like
capturing
an
empty
bandbox
after
a
hard
fight
but
we
have
got
the
picture
jack--we
have
got
the
picture
you
see
and
that
is
something
i
am
sure
we
saved
that
well
that
may
be
and
a
pretty
d----d
looking
picture
it
is
after
all
why
it's
enough
to
frighten
a
lady
into
the
sulks
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
if
it
were
burned
well
said
the
doctor
i
would
sooner
see
it
burned
than
in
the
hands
of
that--
what
exclaimed
jack
i
don't
know
said
mr
chillingworth
but
thief
i
should
say
for
it
was
somewhat
thief-like
to
break
into
another
man's
house
and
carry
off
the
furniture
a
pirate--a
regular
land
shark
something
that
is
not
the
same
as
an
honest
man
jack
but
at
all
events
we
have
beaten
him
back
this
time
yes
said
jack
the
ship's
cleared
no
company
is
better
than
bad
company
doctor
so
it
is
and
yet
it
don't
seem
clear
in
terms
but
jack
it
you
hadn't
come
in
time
i
should
have
been
but
scurvily
treated
he
was
too
powerful
for
me
i
was
as
nigh
being
killed
as
ever
i
have
been
but
you
were
just
in
time
to
save
me
well
he
was
a
large
ugly
fellow
sure
enough
and
looked
like
an
old
tree
did
you
see
him
yes
to
be
sure
i
did
well
i
could
not
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
features
in
fact
i
was
too
much
employed
to
see
anything
and
it
was
much
too
dark
to
notice
anything
particular
even
if
i
had
had
leisure
why
you
had
as
much
to
do
as
you
could
well
manage
i
must
say
that
at
all
events
i
didn't
see
much
of
him
myself
only
he
was
a
tall
out-of-the-way
sort
of
chap--a
long-legged
shark
he
gave
me
such
a
dig
or
two
as
i
haven't
had
for
a
long
while
nor
don't
want
to
get
again
though
i
don't
care
if
i
face
the
devil
himself
a
man
can't
do
more
than
do
his
best
doctor
no
jack
but
there
are
very
few
who
do
do
their
best
and
that's
the
truth
you
have
and
have
done
it
to
some
purpose
too
but
i
have
had
enough
for
one
day
he
was
almost
strong
enough
to
contend
against
us
both
yes
so
he
was
and
besides
that
he
almost
carried
away
the
picture--that
was
a
great
hindrance
to
him
don't
you
think
we
could
have
held
him
if
we
had
not
been
fighting
over
the
picture
yes
to
be
sure
we
could
we
could
have
gone
at
him
bodily
and
held
him
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
use
his
hands
we
could
have
hung
on
him
and
i
am
sure
if
i
came
to
grapple
yard-arm
and
yard-arm
he
would
have
told
a
different
tale
however
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
how
long
had
you
been
here
not
very
long
replied
the
doctor
whose
head
was
a
little
confused
by
the
blows
which
he
had
received
i
can't
now
tell
how
long
but
only
a
short
time
i
think
where
did
he
come
from
inquired
jack
come
from
jack
yes
doctor
where
did
he
came
from--the
window
i
suppose--the
same
way
he
went
out
i
dare
say--it's
most
likely
oh
no
no
he
come
down
from
behind
the
picture
there's
some
mystery
in
that
picture
i'll
swear
to
it
it's
very
strange
he
should
make
such
a
desperate
attempt
to
carry
it
away
yes
one
would
think
said
jack
there
was
more
in
it
than
we
can
see--that
it
is
worth
more
than
we
can
believe
perhaps
somebody
sets
particular
store
by
it
i
don't
know
said
mr
chillingworth
shaking
his
head
i
don't
know
how
that
may
be
but
certain
it
is
the
picture
was
the
object
of
his
visit
here--that
is
very
certain
it
was
he
was
endeavouring
to
carry
it
off
said
jack
it
would
be
a
very
good
ornament
to
the
black
hole
at
calcutta
the
utility
of
putting
it
where
it
cannot
be
seen
remarked
mr
chillingworth
i
cannot
very
well
see
though
i
dare
say
it
might
be
all
very
well
yes--its
ugly
features
would
be
no
longer
seen
so
far
it
would
be
a
good
job
but
are
you
going
to
remain
here
all
night
and
so
make
a
long
watch
of
it
doctor
why
jack
said
the
doctor
i
did
intend
watching
here
but
now
the
game
is
disturbed
it
is
of
no
use
remaining
here
we
have
secured
the
picture
and
now
there
will
be
no
need
of
remaining
in
the
house
in
fact
there
is
no
fear
of
robbery
now
not
so
long
as
we
are
here
said
jack
pringle
the
smugglers
won't
show
a
head
while
the
revenue
cutter
is
on
the
look
out
certainly
not
jack
said
mr
chillingworth
i
think
we
have
scared
them
away--the
picture
is
safe
yes--so
long
as
we
are
here
and
longer
too
i
hope
jack
shook
his
head
as
much
as
to
intimate
that
he
had
many
doubts
upon
such
a
point
and
couldn't
be
hurried
into
any
concession
of
opinion
of
the
safety
of
such
a
picture
as
that--much
as
he
disliked
it
and
as
poor
an
opinion
as
he
had
of
it
don't
you
think
it
will
be
safe
no
said
jack
and
why
not
said
mr
chillingworth
willing
to
hear
what
jack
could
advance
against
the
opinion
he
had
expressed
especially
as
he
had
disturbed
the
marauder
in
the
very
act
of
robbery
why
you'll
be
watched
by
this
very
man
and
when
you
are
gone
he
will
return
in
safety
and
take
this
plaguey
picture
away
with
him
well
he
might
do
so
said
mr
chillingworth
after
some
thought
he
even
endangered
his
own
escape
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
it
off
he
wants
it
said
jack
what
the
picture
aye
to
be
sure
do
you
think
anybody
would
have
tried
so
hard
to
get
away
with
it
he
wants
it
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
he
will
have
it
despite
all
that
can
be
done
to
prevent
it
that's
my
opinion
well
there
is
much
truth
in
that
but
what
to
do
i
don't
know
take
it
to
the
cottage
suggested
jack
the
picture
must
be
more
than
we
think
for
suppose
we
carry
it
along
that
is
no
bad
plan
of
yours
jack
said
mr
chillingworth
and
though
a
little
awkward
yet
it
is
not
the
worst
i
have
heard
but--but--what
will
they
say
when
they
see
this
frightful
face
in
that
quiet
yet
contented
house
why
they'll
say
you
brought
it
said
jack
i
don't
see
what
else
they
can
say
but
that
you
have
done
well
besides
when
you
come
to
explain
you
will
make
the
matter
all
right
to
'em
yes
yes
said
chillingworth
and
as
the
picture
now
seems
to
be
the
incomprehensible
object
of
attack
i
will
secure
that
at
all
events
i'll
help
you
thank
you
jack
your
aid
will
be
welcome
at
least
it
was
so
just
now
all
right
doctor
said
jack
i
may
be
under
your
hands
some
day
i'll
physic
you
for
nothing
said
mr
chillingworth
you
saved
my
life
one
good
turn
deserves
another
i'll
not
forget
thank
you
said
jack
as
he
made
a
wry
face
i
hope
you
won't
have
occasion
i'd
sooner
have
a
can
of
grog
than
any
bottle
of
medicine
you
can
give
me
i
ain't
ungrateful
neither
you
needn't
name
it
i
am
getting
my
breath
again
i
suppose
we
had
better
leave
this
place
as
soon
as
we
conveniently
can
exactly
the
sooner
the
better
we
can
take
it
the
more
leisurely
as
we
go
the
moon
was
up
there
were
no
clouds
now
but
there
was
not
a
very
strong
light
because
the
moon
was
on
the
wane
it
was
one
of
those
nights
during
which
an
imperceptible
vapour
arises
and
renders
the
moon
somewhat
obscure
or
at
least
it
robs
the
earth
of
her
rays
and
then
there
were
shadows
cast
by
the
moon
yet
they
grew
fainter
and
those
cast
upon
the
floor
of
the
apartment
were
less
distinct
than
at
first
there
seemed
scarce
a
breath
of
air
stirring
everything
was
quiet
and
still
no
motion--no
sound
save
that
of
the
breathing
of
the
two
who
sat
in
that
mysterious
apartment
who
gazed
alternately
round
the
place
and
then
in
each
other's
countenances
suddenly
the
silence
of
the
night
was
disturbed
by
a
very
slight
but
distinct
noise
which
struck
upon
them
with
peculiar
distinctness
it
was
a
gentle
tap
tap
at
the
window
as
if
some
one
was
doing
it
with
their
fingernail
they
gazed
on
each
other
for
some
moments
in
amazement
and
then
at
the
window
but
they
saw
nothing
and
yet
had
there
been
anything
they
must
have
seen
it
but
there
was
not
even
a
shadow
well
said
mr
chillingworth
after
he
had
listened
to
the
tap
tap
several
times
without
being
able
to
find
out
or
imagine
what
it
could
arise
from
what
on
earth
can
it
be
don't
know
said
jack
very
composedly
squinting
up
at
the
window
can't
see
anything
well
but
it
must
be
something
persisted
mr
chillingworth
it
must
be
something
i
dare
say
it
is
but
i
don't
see
anything
i
can't
think
what
it
can
be
unless--
unless
what
speak
out
said
the
doctor
impatiently
why
unless
it
is
davy
jones
himself
tapping
with
his
long
finger-nails
a-telling
us
as
how
we've
been
too
long
already
here
then
i
presume
we
may
as
well
go
and
yet
i
am
more
disposed
to
deem
it
some
device
of
the
enemy
to
dislodge
us
from
this
place
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
them
to
effect
some
nefarious
scheme
or
other
they
have
afloat
it
may
be
and
is
i
dare
say
a
do
of
some
sort
or
other
said
jack
but
what'
can
it
be
there
it
is
again
said
the
doctor
don't
you
hear
it
i
can
as
plain
as
i
can
hear
myself
yes
said
jack
i
can
hear
it
plain
enough
and
can
see
it
too
and
that
is
more
yes
yes
i
can
tell
all
about
it
plain
enough
you
can
well
then
shew
me
said
the
doctor
as
he
strode
up
to
the
window
before
which
jack
was
standing
gazing
upon
one
particular
spot
of
the
shattered
window
with
much
earnestness
where
is
it
look
there
said
jack
pointing
with
his
finger
to
a
particular
spot
to
which
the
doctor
directed
his
attention
expecting
to
see
a
long
skinny
hand
tapping
against
the
glass
but
he
saw
nothing
where
is
it
do
you
see
that
twig
of
ivy
or
something
of
the
sort
inquired
jack
yes
i
do
very
well
watch
that
and
when
the
wind
catches
it--and
there
is
but
very
little--it
lifts
it
up
and
then
falling
down
again
it
taps
the
glass
just
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
slight
gust
of
wind
and
it
gave
a
practical
illustration
to
his
words
for
the
tapping
was
heard
as
often
as
the
plant
was
moved
by
the
wind
well
said
mr
chillingworth
however
simple
and
unimportant
the
matter
may
be
yet
i
cannot
but
say
i
am
always
well
pleased
to
find
a
practical
explanation
of
it
so
that
there
will
be
no
part
left
in
doubt
there
is
none
about
that
said
jack
none
well
we
are
not
beset
then
we
may
as
well
consider
of
the
manner
of
our
getting
clear
of
this
place
what
sort
of
burthen
this
picture
may
be
i
know
not
but
i
will
make
the
attempt
to
carry
it
avast
there
said
jack
i
will
carry
it
at
all
events
i'll
take
the
first
spell
and
if
i
can't
go
on
we'll
turn
and
turn
about
we
can
divide
the
weight
from
the
first
and
then
neither
of
us
will
be
tired
at
all
just
as
you
please
sir
said
jack
pringle
i
am
willing
to
obey
orders
and
if
we
are
to
get
in
to-night
before
they
are
all
a-bed
we
had
better
go
at
once
and
then
we
shall
not
disturb
them
good
jack
said
mr
chillingworth
very
good
let
us
begin
to
beat
our
retreat
at
once
very
good
said
jack
they
both
rose
and
approached
the
picture
which
stood
up
in
one
corner
half
reclining
against
the
wall
the
light
at
least
so
much
as
there
was
fell
upon
it
and
gave
it
a
ghastly
and
deathly
hue
which
made
mr
chillingworth
feel
an
emotion
he
could
not
at
all
understand
but
as
soon
as
he
could
he
withdrew
his
eyes
from
off
the
picture
and
they
proceeded
to
secure
it
with
some
cord
so
that
they
might
carry
it
between
them
the
easier--with
less
trouble
and
more
safety
these
preparations
did
not
take
long
in
making
and
when
completed
they
gave
another
inquiring
look
round
the
chamber
and
mr
chillingworth
again
approached
the
window
and
gazed
out
upon
the
garden
below
but
saw
nothing
to
attract
his
attention
turning
away
he
came
to
the
picture
with
which
jack
pringle
had
been
standing
they
proceeded
towards
the
stairs
adopting
every
precaution
they
could
take
to
prevent
any
surprise
and
any
attempt
upon
the
object
of
their
solicitude
then
they
came
to
the
great
hall
and
having
opened
the
door
they
carried
it
out
then
shutting
the
door
they
both
stood
outside
of
bannerworth
hall
and
before
taking
the
picture
up
in
their
hands
they
once
more
looked
suspiciously
around
them
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
and
so
shouldering
the
ominous
portrait
they
proceeded
along
the
garden
till
they
conveyed
it
into
the
roadway
now
said
jack
we
are
off
we
can
scud
along
under
press
of
sail
you
know
i
would
rather
not
said
the
doctor
for
two
reasons
one
of
which
is
i
can't
do
it
myself
and
the
other
is
we
should
run
the
risk
of
injuring
the
picture
besides
this
there
is
no
reason
for
so
doing
very
well
said
jack
make
it
agreeable
to
yourself
doctor
see
you
jack's
alive
and
i
am
willing
to
do
all
i
can
to
help
you
i
am
very
glad
of
your
aid
said
mr
chillingworth
so
we
will
proceed
slowly
i
shall
be
glad
when
we
are
there
for
there
are
few
things
more
awkward
than
this
picture
to
carry
it
is
not
heavy
said
jack
giving
it
a
hitch
up
that
first
pulled
the
doctor
back
and
then
pushed
him
forward
again
no
but
stop
don't
do
that
often
jack
or
else
i
shall
be
obliged
to
let
go
to
save
myself
from
falling
said
the
doctor
very
sorry
said
jack
hope
it
didn't
inconvenience
you
but
i
could
carry
this
by
myself
and
so
could
i
returned
mr
chillingworth
but
the
probability
is
there
would
be
some
mischief
done
to
it
and
then
we
should
be
doing
more
harm
than
good
so
we
should
said
jack
they
proceeded
along
with
much
care
and
caution
it
was
growing
late
now
and
no
one
was
about--at
least
they
met
none
people
did
not
roam
about
much
after
dark
especially
since
the
reports
of
the
vampyre
became
current
for
notwithstanding
all
their
bravery
and
violence
while
in
a
body
yet
to
meet
and
contend
with
him
singly
and
unseen
was
not
at
all
a
popular
notion
among
them
indeed
they
would
sooner
go
a
mile
out
of
their
way
or
remain
in
doors
which
they
usually
did
the
evening
was
not
precisely
dark
there
was
moonlight
enough
to
save
it
from
that
but
there
was
a
mist
hanging
about
that
rendered
objects
at
a
short
distance
very
indistinct
their
walk
was
uninterrupted
by
any
one
and
they
had
got
through
half
the
distance
without
any
disturbance
or
interruption
whatever
when
they
arrived
at
the
precincts
of
the
village
jack
pringle
said
to
dr
chillingworth
do
you
intend
going
through
the
village
doctor
why
not
there
will
be
nobody
about
and
if
there
should
be
we
shall
be
safe
enough
from
any
molestation
seeing
there
are
none
here
who
would
dare
to
harm
us
it
is
the
shortest
way
too
very
good
said
jack
i
am
agreeable
and
as
for
any
one
harming
me
they
know
better
but
at
all
events
there's
company
and
there's
less
danger
you
know
doctor
though
i'm
always
company
to
myself
but
haven't
any
objection
to
a
messmate
now
and
then
they
pursued
their
way
in
silence
for
some
distance
the
doctor
not
caring
about
continuing
the
talk
of
jack
which
amounted
to
nothing
besides
he
had
too
much
to
do
for
notwithstanding
the
lightness
of
the
picture
which
jack
had
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
doctor
of
he
found
it
was
heavy
and
ungainly
indeed
had
he
been
by
himself
he
would
have
had
some
trouble
to
have
got
it
away
we
are
nearly
there
said
jack
putting
down
his
end
of
the
picture
which
brought
doctor
chillingworth
to
a
standstill
yes
we
are
but
what
made
you
stop
why
you
see
said
jack
giving
his
trowsers
a
hitch
as
i
said
before
we
are
nearly
there
well
what
of
that
we
intended
to
go
there
did
we
not
inquired
chillingworth
yes
exactly
that
is
you
intended
to
do
so
i
know
but
i
didn't
what
do
you
mean
by
that
inquired
chillingworth
you
are
a
complete
riddle
to-night
jack
what
is
the
matter
with
you
nothing
only
you
see
i
don't
want
to
go
into
the
cottage
'cause
you
see
the
admiral
and
i
have
had
what
you
may
call
a
bit
of
a
growl
and
i
am
in
disgrace
there
a
little
though
i
don't
know
why
or
wherefore
i
always
did
my
duty
by
him
as
i
did
by
my
country
the
ould
man
however
takes
fits
into
his
head
at
the
same
time
i
shall
take
some
too
jack's
as
good
as
his
master
ashore
at
all
events
well
then
you
object
to
go
in
said
chillingworth
that
is
the
state
of
the
case
not
that
i'm
afraid
or
have
any
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
but
i
don't
want
to
make
anybody
else
uncomfortable
by
causing
black
looks
very
well
jack
said
the
doctor
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
and
if
you
don't
like
to
come
i
won't
press
you
against
your
inclination
i
understand
doctor
i
will
leave
you
here
if
you
can
manage
the
rest
of
the
way
by
yourself
there
are
not
two
hundred
yards
now
to
go
so
you
are
all
safe
so
good
bye
good
bye
jack
said
doctor
chillingworth
who
stood
wiping
his
forehead
whilst
the
picture
was
standing
up
against
the
poles
do
you
want
a
hand
up
first
no
thank
you
i
can
get
it
up
very
well
without
any
trouble--it's
not
so
heavy
good
bye
then
said
jack
and
in
a
few
moments
more
jack
pringle
was
out
of
sight
and
the
doctor
was
alone
with
the
ominous
picture
he
had
not
far
to
go
and
was
within
hail
of
the
cottage
but
it
was
late
and
yet
he
believed
he
should
find
them
up
for
the
quietude
and
calmness
of
the
evening
hour
was
that
which
most
chimed
with
their
feelings
at
such
a
time
they
could
look
out
upon
the
face
of
nature
and
the
freedom
of
thought
appeared
the
greater
because
there
was
no
human
being
to
clash
with
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
scene
well
muttered
chillingworth
i'll
go
at
once
to
the
cottage
with
my
burthen
how
they
will
look
at
me
and
wonder
what
could
induce
me
to
bring
this
away
i
can
hardly
help
smiling
at
the
thought
of
how
they
will
look
at
the
apparition
i
shall
make
thus
filled
with
notions
that
appeared
to
please
him
the
doctor
shouldered
the
picture
and
walked
slowly
along
until
he
reached
the
dead
wall
that
ran
up
to
the
entrance
or
nearly
so
of
the
gardens
there
was
a
plantation
of
young
trees
that
overhung
the
path
and
cast
a
deep
shadow
below--a
pleasant
spot
in
hot
weather
the
doctor
had
been
carrying
the
picture
resting
the
side
of
it
on
the
small
of
his
arm
and
against
his
shoulder
but
this
was
an
inconvenient
posture
because
the
weight
of
the
picture
cut
his
arm
so
much
that
he
was
compelled
to
pause
and
shift
it
more
on
his
shoulder
there
he
muttered
that
will
do
for
the
present
and
last
until
i
reach
the
cottage
garden
he
was
proceeding
along
at
a
slow
and
steady
pace
bestowing
all
his
care
and
attention
to
the
manner
of
holding
the
picture
when
he
was
suddenly
paralysed
by
the
sound
of
a
great
shout
of
such
a
peculiar
character
that
he
involuntarily
stopped
and
the
next
moment
something
heavy
came
against
him
with
great
force
just
as
if
a
man
had
jumped
from
the
wall
on
to
him
this
was
the
truth
for
in
another
moment
and
before
he
could
recover
himself
he
found
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
deprive
him
of
the
picture
this
at
once
aroused
him
and
he
made
an
instant
and
a
vigorous
defence
but
he
was
compelled
to
let
go
his
hold
of
the
picture
and
turn
to
resist
the
infuriated
attack
that
was
now
commenced
upon
himself
for
some
moments
it
was
doubtful
who
would
be
the
victor
but
the
wind
and
strength
of
the
doctor
were
not
enough
to
resist
the
powerful
adversary
against
whom
he
had
to
contend
and
the
heavy
blows
that
were
showered
down
upon
him
at
first
he
was
enabled
to
bear
up
against
this
attack
and
then
he
returned
many
of
the
blows
with
interest
but
the
stunning
effect
of
the
blows
he
received
himself
was
such
that
he
could
not
help
himself
and
felt
his
senses
gradually
failing
his
strength
becoming
less
and
less
in
a
short
time
he
received
such
a
blow
that
he
was
laid
senseless
on
the
earth
in
an
instant
how
long
he
remained
thus
he
could
not
say
but
it
could
not
have
been
long
for
all
around
him
seemed
just
as
it
was
before
he
was
attacked
the
moon
had
scarcely
moved
and
the
shadows
such
as
they
were
were
falling
in
the
same
direction
as
before
i
have
not
been
long
here
he
muttered
after
a
few
moments'
reflection
but--but--
he
stopped
short
for
on
looking
around
him
he
saw
the
object
of
his
solicitude
was
gone
the
picture
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
it
had
been
carried
off
the
instant
he
had
been
vanquished
gone
he
said
in
a
low
disconsolate
tone
and
after
all
i
have
done
he
wiped
his
hand
across
his
brow
and
finding
it
cut
he
looked
at
the
back
of
his
hand
and
saw
by
the
deep
colour
that
it
was
blood
indeed
he
could
now
feel
it
trickle
down
his
face
what
to
do
he
hardly
knew
he
could
stand
and
after
having
got
upon
his
feet
he
staggered
back
against
the
wall
against
which
he
leaned
for
support
and
afterwards
he
crept
along
with
the
aid
of
its
support
until
he
came
to
the
door
he
was
observed
from
the
window
where
henry
and
charles
holland
seeing
him
come
up
with
such
an
unsteady
gait
rushed
to
the
door
to
ascertain
what
was
the
matter
what
doctor
exclaimed
henry
bannerworth
what
is
the
matter
i
am
almost
dead
i
think
said
chillingworth
lend
me
your
arm
henry
henry
and
charles
holland
immediately
stepped
out
and
took
him
between
them
into
the
parlour
and
placed
him
upon
a
couch
what
on
earth
has
happened
doctor--have
you
got
into
disgrace
with
the
populace
no
no
give
me
some
drink--some
water
i
am
very
faint--very
faint
give
him
some
wine
or
what's
better
some
grog
said
the
admiral
why
he's
been
yard-arm
with
some
pirate
or
other
and
he's
damaged
about
the
figure-head
you
ain't
hurt
in
your
lower
works
are
you
doctor
said
the
admiral
but
the
doctor
took
no
notice
of
the
inquiry
but
eagerly
sipped
the
contents
of
a
glass
that
charles
holland
had
poured
out
of
a
bottle
containing
some
strong
hollands
and
which
appeared
to
nerve
him
much
there
said
the
admiral
that
will
do
you
good
how
did
all
this
damage
to
your
upper
works
come
about
eh
let
him
wash
his
face
and
hands
first
he
will
be
better
able
to
talk
afterwards
oh
thank
you
said
chillingworth
i
am
much
better
but
i
have
had
some
hard
bruises
how
did
it
happen
i
went
by
myself
to
watch
in
the
room
where
the
picture
was
in
bannerworth
hall
where
the
picture
was
said
henry
where
it
is
you
mean
do
you
not
doctor
no
where
it
was
and
where
it
is
not
now
gone
yes
gone
away
i'll
tell
you
all
about
it
i
went
there
to
watch
but
found
nobody
or
nothing
there
but
suddenly
a
man
stepped
out
from
behind
the
picture
and
we
had
a
fight
over
it
after
which
just
as
i
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
jack
pringle
came
in
the
dog
muttered
the
admiral
yes
he
came
in
just
in
time
i
believe
to
save
my
life
for
the
man
whoever
he
was
would
not
have
hesitated
about
it
well
jack
is
a
good
man
said
the
admiral
there
may
be
worse
at
least
well
we
had
a
desperate
encounter
for
some
minutes
during
which
this
fellow
wanted
to
carry
off
the
picture
carry
off
the
picture
yes
we
had
a
struggle
for
that
but
we
could
not
capture
him
he
was
so
violent
that
he
broke
away
and
got
clear
off
with
the
picture
no
he
left
the
picture
behind
well
we
were
very
tired
and
bruised
and
we
sat
down
to
recover
ourselves
from
our
fatigue
and
to
consider
what
was
best
to
be
done
but
we
were
some
time
before
we
could
leave
and
then
we
determined
that
we
would
take
the
picture
away
with
us
as
it
seemed
to
be
coveted
by
the
robber
for
what
object
we
cannot
tell
well
well--where
is
the
picture
you
shall
hear
all
about
it
in
a
minute
if
you'll
let
me
take
my
time
i
am
tired
and
sore
well
we
brought
the
picture
out
and
jack
helped
me
carry
it
till
he
came
within
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
of
the
cottage
and
there
left
me
the
lubber
said
the
admiral
interjectionally
well
i
rested
awhile
and
then
taking
the
picture
on
my
shoulders
i
proceeded
along
with
it
until
i
came
to
the
wall
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
great
shout
and
then
down
came
something
heavy
upon
me
just
as
if
a
man
had
jumped
down
upon
me
and--and--
yes
said
the
doctor
it
was--
was
what
inquired
the
admiral
just
what
you
all
seemed
to
anticipate
you
are
all
before
me
but
that
was
it
a
man
yes
i
had
a
struggle
with
him
and
got
nearly
killed
for
i
am
not
equal
to
him
in
strength
i
was
sadly
knocked
about
and
finally
all
the
senses
were
knocked
out
of
me
and
i
was
i
suppose
left
for
dead
and
what
became
of
the
picture
i
don't
know
but
i
suppose
it
was
taken
away
as
when
i
came
to
myself
it
was
gone
indeed
i
have
some
faint
recollection
of
seeing
him
seize
the
portrait
as
i
was
falling
there
was
a
pause
of
some
moments
during
which
all
the
party
appeared
to
be
employed
with
their
own
thoughts
and
the
whole
were
silent
do
you
think
it
was
the
same
man
who
attacked
you
in
the
house
that
obtained
the
picture
at
last
inquired
henry
bannerworth
i
cannot
say
but
i
think
it
most
probable
that
it
was
the
same
indeed
the
general
appearance
as
near
as
i
could
tell
in
the
dark
was
the
same
but
what
i
look
upon
as
much
stronger
is
the
object
appears
to
be
the
same
in
both
cases
that
is
very
true
said
henry
bannerworth--very
true
and
i
think
it
more
than
probable
myself
but
come
doctor
you
will
require
rest
and
nursing
after
your
dangers
the
alarm
at
anderbury--the
suspicions
of
the
bannerworth
family
and
the
mysterious
communication
illustration
about
twenty
miles
to
the
southward
of
bannerworth
hall
was
a
good-sized
market-town
called
anderbury
it
was
an
extensive
and
flourishing
place
and
from
the
beauty
of
its
situation
and
its
contiguity
to
the
southern
coast
of
england
it
was
much
admired
and
in
consequence
numerous
mansions
and
villas
of
great
pretension
had
sprang
up
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
betides
there
were
some
estates
of
great
value
and
one
of
these
called
anderbury-on-the-mount
in
consequence
of
the
mansion
itself
which
was
of
an
immense
extent
being
built
upon
an
eminence
was
to
be
let
or
sold
this
town
of
anderbury
was
remarkable
not
only
for
the
beauty
of
its
aspect
but
likewise
for
the
quiet
serenity
of
its
inhabitants
who
were
a
prosperous
thriving
race
and
depended
very
much
upon
their
own
resources
there
were
some
peculiar
circumstances
why
anderbury-on-the-mount
was
to
let
it
had
been
for
a
great
number
of
years
in
possession
of
a
family
of
the
name
of
milltown
who
had
resided
there
in
great
comfort
and
respectability
until
an
epidemic
disorder
broke
out
first
among
the
servants
and
then
spreading
to
the
junior
branches
of
the
family
and
from
them
to
their
seniors
produced
such
devastation
that
in
the
course
of
three
weeks
there
was
but
one
young
man
left
of
the
whole
family
and
he
by
native
vigour
of
constitution
had
baffled
the
disorder
and
found
himself
alone
in
his
ancestral
halls
the
last
of
his
race
soon
a
settled
melancholy
took
possession
of
him
and
all
that
had
formerly
delighted
him
now
gave
him
pain
inasmuch
as
it
brought
to
his
mind
a
host
of
recollections
of
the
most
agonising
character
in
vain
was
it
that
the
surrounding
gentry
paid
him
every
possible
attention
and
endeavoured
to
do
all
that
was
in
their
power
to
alleviate
the
unhappy
circumstances
in
which
he
was
placed
if
he
smiled
it
was
in
a
sad
sort
and
that
was
very
seldom
and
at
length
he
announced
his
intention
of
leaving
the
neighbourhood
and
seeking
abroad
and
in
change
of
scene
for
that
solace
which
he
could
not
expect
to
find
in
his
ancestral
home
after
what
had
occurred
within
its
ancient
walls
there
was
not
a
chamber
but
which
reminded
him
of
the
past--there
was
not
a
tree
or
a
plant
of
any
kind
or
description
but
which
spoke
to
him
plainly
of
those
who
were
now
no
more
and
whose
merry
laughter
had
within
his
own
memory
made
that
ancient
place
echo
with
glee
filling
the
sunny
air
with
the
most
gladsome
shouts
such
as
come
from
the
lips
of
happy
youth
long
before
the
world
has
robbed
it
of
any
of
its
romance
or
its
beauty
there
was
a
general
feeling
of
regret
when
this
young
man
announced
the
fact
of
his
departure
to
a
foreign
land
for
he
was
much
respected
and
the
known
calamities
which
he
had
suffered
and
the
grief
under
which
he
laboured
invested
his
character
with
a
great
and
painful
interest
an
entertainment
was
given
to
him
upon
the
eve
of
his
departure
and
on
the
next
day
he
was
many
miles
from
the
place
and
the
estate
of
anderbury-on-the-mount
was
understood
to
be
sold
or
let
the
old
mansion
had
remained
then
for
a
year
or
two
vacant
for
it
was
a
place
of
too
much
magnitude
and
required
by
far
too
expensive
an
establishment
to
keep
it
going
to
enable
any
person
whose
means
were
not
very
large
to
think
of
having
anything
to
do
with
it
so
therefore
it
remained
unlet
and
wearing
that
gloomy
aspect
which
a
large
house
untenanted
so
very
quickly
assumes
it
was
quite
a
melancholy
thing
to
look
upon
it
and
to
think
what
it
must
have
once
been
and
what
it
might
be
still
compared
to
what
it
actually
was
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighbourhood
had
made
up
their
minds
that
anderbury-on-the-mount
would
remain
untenanted
for
many
a
year
to
come
and
perhaps
ultimately
fall
into
ruin
and
decay
but
in
this
they
were
doomed
to
be
disappointed
for
on
the
evening
of
a
dull
and
gloomy
day
about
one
week
after
the
events
we
have
recorded
as
taking
place
at
bannerworth
hall
and
its
immediate
neighbourhood
a
travelling
carriage
with
four
horses
and
an
out-rider
came
dashing
into
the
place
and
drew
up
at
the
principal
inn
in
the
town
which
was
called
the
anderbury
arms
the
appearance
of
such
an
equipage
although
not
the
most
unusual
thing
in
the
world
in
consequence
of
the
many
aristocratic
families
who
resided
in
the
neighbourhood
caused
at
all
events
some
sensation
and
perhaps
the
more
so
because
it
drove
up
to
the
inn
instead
of
to
any
of
the
mansions
of
the
neighbourhood
thereby
showing
that
the
stranger
whoever
he
was
came
not
as
a
visitor
but
either
merely
baited
in
the
town
being
on
his
road
somewhere
else
or
had
some
special
business
in
it
which
would
soon
be
learned
the
out-rider
who
was
in
handsome
livery
had
gallopped
on
in
advance
of
the
carriage
a
short
distance
for
the
purpose
of
ordering
the
best
apartments
in
the
inn
to
be
immediately
prepared
for
the
reception
of
his
master
who
is
he
asked
the
landlord
it's
the
baron
stolmuyer
saltsburgh
bless
my
heart
i
never
heard
of
him
before
where
did
he
come
from--somewhere
abroad
i
suppose
i
can't
tell
you
anything
of
him
further
than
that
he
is
immensely
rich
and
is
looking
for
a
house
he
has
heard
that
there
is
one
to
let
in
this
immediate
neighbourhood
and
that's
what
has
brought
him
from
london
i
suppose
yes
there
is
one
and
it
is
called
anderbury-on-the-mount
well
he
will
very
likely
speak
to
you
about
it
himself
for
here
he
comes
by
this
time
the
carriage
had
halted
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
and
the
door
being
opened
and
the
steps
lowered
there
alighted
from
it
a
tall
man
attired
in
a
kind
of
pelisse
or
cloak
trimmed
with
rich
fur
the
body
of
it
being
composed
of
velvet
upon
his
head
he
wore
a
travelling
cap
and
his
fingers
as
he
grasped
the
cloak
around
him
were
seen
to
be
covered
with
rings
of
great
value
such
a
personage
coming
in
such
style
was
of
course
likely
to
be
honoured
in
every
possible
way
by
the
landlord
of
the
inn
and
accordingly
he
was
shown
most
obsequiously
to
the
handsomest
apartment
in
the
house
and
the
whole
establishment
was
put
upon
the
alert
to
attend
to
any
orders
he
might
choose
to
give
he
had
not
been
long
in
the
place
when
he
sent
for
the
landlord
who
hastily
scrambling
on
his
best
coat
and
getting
his
wife
to
arrange
the
tie
of
his
neckcloth
proceeded
to
obey
the
orders
of
his
illustrious
guest
whatever
they
might
chance
to
be
he
found
the
baron
stolmuyer
reclining
upon
a
sofa
and
having
thrown
aside
his
velvet
cloak
trimmed
with
rich
fur
he
showed
that
underneath
it
he
wore
a
costume
of
great
richness
and
beauty
although
certainly
the
form
it
covered
was
not
calculated
to
set
it
off
to
any
great
advantage
for
the
baron
was
merely
skin
and
bone
and
looked
like
a
man
who
had
just
emerged
from
a
long
illness
for
his
face
was
ghastly
pale
and
the
landlord
could
not
help
observing
that
there
was
a
strange
peculiarity
about
his
eyes
the
reason
of
which
he
could
not
make
out
you
are
the
landlord
of
this
inn
i
presume
said
the
baron
and
consequently
no
doubt
well
acquainted
with
the
neighbourhood
i
have
the
honour
to
be
all
that
sir
i
have
been
here
about
sixteen
years
and
in
that
time
i
certainly
ought
to
know
something
of
the
neighbourhood
'tis
well
some
one
told
me
there
was
a
little
cottage
sort
of
place
to
let
here
and
as
i
am
simple
and
retired
in
my
habits
i
thought
that
it
might
possibly
suit
me
a
little
cottage
sir
there
are
certainly
little
cottages
to
let
but
not
such
as
would
suit
you
and
if
i
might
have
presumed
sir
to
think
i
should
have
considered
anderbury-on-the-mount
which
is
now
to
let
would
have
been
the
place
for
you
it
is
a
large
place
sir
and
belonged
to
a
good
family
although
they
are
now
all
dead
and
gone
except
one
and
it's
he
who
wants
to
let
the
old
place
anderbury-on-the-mount
said
the
baron
was
the
name
of
the
place
mentioned
to
me
but
i
understood
it
was
a
little
place
oh
sir
that
is
quite
a
mistake
who
told
you
so
it's
the
largest
place
about
here
there
are
a
matter
of
twenty-seven
rooms
in
it
and
it
stands
altogether
upon
three
hundred
acres
of
ground
and
have
you
the
assurance
said
the
baron
to
call
that
anything
but
a
cottage
when
the
castle
of
the
stolmuyers
at
saltzburgh
has
one
suite
of
reception
rooms
thirty
in
number
opening
into
each
other
and
the
total
number
of
apartments
in
the
whole
building
is
two
hundred
and
sixty
it
is
surrounded
by
eight
miles
of
territory
the
devil
said
the
landlord
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
when
i
am
astonished
i
generally
say
the
devil
they
want
eight
hundred
pounds
a
year
for
anderbury-on-the-mount
a
mere
trifle
i
will
sleep
here
to-night
and
in
the
morning
i
will
go
and
look
at
the
place
it
is
near
the
sea
half
a
mile
sir
exactly
from
the
beach
and
one
of
the
most
curious
circumstances
of
all
connected
with
it
is
that
there
is
a
subterranean
passage
from
the
grounds
leading
right
away
down
to
the
sea-coast
a
most
curious
place
sir
partly
cut
out
of
the
cliff
with
cellars
in
it
for
wine
and
other
matters
that
in
the
height
of
summer
are
kept
as
cool
as
in
the
deep
winter
time
it's
more
for
curiosity
than
use
such
a
place
and
the
old
couple
that
now
take
care
of
the
house
make
a
pretty
penny
i'll
be
bound
though
they
won't
own
it
by
showing
that
part
of
the
place
it
may
suit
me
but
i
shall
be
able
to
give
a
decisive
answer
when
i
see
it
on
the
morrow
you
will
let
my
attendants
have
what
they
require
and
see
that
my
horses
be
well
looked
to
certainly
oh
certainly
sir
of
course
you
might
go
far
indeed
sir
before
you
found
an
inn
where
everything
would
be
done
as
things
are
done
here
is
there
anything
in
particular
sir
you
would
like
for
dinner
how
can
i
tell
that
idiot
until
the
dinner
time
arrives
well
but
sir
in
that
case
you
know
we
scarcely
know
what
to
do
because
you
see
sir
you
understand--
it
is
very
strange
to
me
that
you
can
neither
see
nor
understand
your
duty
i
am
accustomed
to
having
the
dinner
tables
spread
with
all
that
money
can
procure
then
i
choose
but
not
before
what
it
suits
me
to
partake
of
wil
sir
that
is
a
very
good
way
and
perhaps
we
ain't
quite
so
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
as
we
ought
to
be
in
these
parts
but
another
time
sir
we
shall
know
better
what
we
are
about
without
a
doubt
and
i
only
hope
sir
that
we
shall
have
you
in
the
neighbourhood
for
a
long
time
and
so
sir
putting
one
thing
to
another
and
then
drawing
a
conclusion
from
both
of
them
you
see
sir
you
will
be
able
to
understand
peace
begone
what
is
the
use
of
all
this
bellowing
to
me--i
want
it
not--i
care
not
for
it
the
baron
spoke
these
words
so
furiously
that
the
landlord
was
rather
terrified
than
otherwise
and
left
the
room
hastily
muttering
to
himself
that
he
had
never
come
across
such
a
tiger
and
wondering
where
the
baron
could
have
possibly
come
from
and
what
amount
of
wealth
he
could
be
possessed
of
that
would
enable
him
to
live
in
such
a
princely
style
as
he
mentioned
if
the
baron
stolmuyer
of
saltzburgh
had
wished
ever
so
much
to
impress
upon
the
minds
of
all
persons
in
the
neighbourhood
the
fact
of
his
wealth
and
importance
he
could
not
have
adopted
a
better
plan
to
accomplish
that
object
than
by
first
of
all
impressing
such
facts
upon
the
mind
of
the
landlord
of
the
anderbury
arms
for
in
the
course
of
another
hour
it
was
tolerably
well
spread
all
over
the
town
that
never
had
there
been
such
a
guest
at
the
anderbury
arms
and
that
he
called
anderbury-on-the-mount
with
all
its
rooms--all
its
outbuildings
and
its
three
hundred
acres
of
ground
a
cottage
this
news
spread
like
wildfire
awaking
no
end
of
speculation
and
giving
rise
to
the
most
exaggerated
rumours
so
that
a
number
of
persons
came
to
the
inn
on
purpose
to
endeavour
to
get
a
look
at
the
baron
but
he
did
not
stir
from
his
apartments
so
that
these
wondermongers
were
disappointed
and
even
forced
to
go
away
as
wise
as
they
came
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
they
made
up
their
minds
that
in
the
morning
they
should
surely
be
able
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
him
which
was
considered
a
great
treat
for
a
man
with
an
immense
income
is
looked
upon
in
england
as
a
natural
curiosity
the
landlord
took
his
guest
at
his
word
as
regards
the
dinner
and
provided
such
a
repast
as
seldom
indeed
graced
the
board
at
the
anderbury
arms--a
repast
sufficient
for
twenty
people
and
certainly
which
was
a
monstrous
thing
to
set
before
one
individual
the
baron
however
made
no
remark
but
selected
a
portion
from
some
of
the
dishes
and
those
dishes
that
he
did
select
from
were
of
the
simplest
kind
and
not
such
as
the
landlord
expected
him
to
take
so
that
he
really
paid
about
one
hundred
times
the
amount
he
ought
to
have
done
for
what
actually
passed
his
lips
and
then
what
a
fidget
the
landlord
was
in
about
his
wines
for
he
doubted
not
but
such
a
guest
would
be
extremely
critical
and
hard
to
please
but
to
his
great
relief
the
baron
declined
taking
any
wine
merely
washing
down
his
repast
with
a
tumbler
of
cool
water
and
then
although
the
hour
was
very
early
he
retired
at
once
to
rest
the
landlord
was
not
disposed
to
disregard
the
injunction
which
the
baron
had
given
him
to
attend
carefully
on
his
servants
and
horses
and
after
giving
orders
that
nothing
should
be
stinted
as
regarded
the
latter
he
himself
looked
to
the
creature-comforts
of
the
former
and
he
did
this
with
a
double
motive
for
not
only
was
he
anxious
to
make
the
most
he
could
out
of
the
baron
in
the
way
of
charges
but
he
was
positively
panting
with
curiosity
to
know
more
about
so
singular
a
personage
and
he
thought
that
surely
the
servants
must
be
able
to
furnish
him
with
some
particulars
regarding
their
eccentric
master
in
this
however
he
was
mistaken
for
although
they
told
him
all
they
knew
that
amounted
to
so
little
as
really
not
to
be
worth
the
learning
they
informed
him
that
they
had
been
engaged
all
in
the
last
week
and
that
they
knew
nothing
of
the
baron
whatever
or
where
he
came
from
or
what
he
was
excepting
that
he
paid
them
most
liberal
wages
and
was
not
very
exacting
in
the
service
he
required
of
them
this
was
very
unsatisfactory
and
when
the
landlord
started
on
a
mission
which
he
considered
himself
bound
to
perform
to
a
mr
leek
in
the
town
who
had
the
letting
of
anderbury-on-the-mount
he
was
quite
vexed
to
think
what
a
small
amount
of
information
he
was
able
to
carry
to
him
i
can
tell
him
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
quickly
towards
the
agent's
residence
i
can
tell
him
the
baron's
name
and
that
in
the
morning
he
wants
to
look
at
anderbury-on-the-mount
but
that's
all
i
know
of
him
except
that
he
is
a
most
extraordinary
man--indeed
the
most
extraordinary
that
i
ever
came
near
mr
leek
the
house
agent
notwithstanding
the
deficiency
of
the
facts
contained
in
the
landlord's
statement
was
well
enough
satisfied
to
hear
that
any
one
of
apparent
wealth
was
inquiring
after
the
large
premises
to
let
for
as
he
said
truly
to
the
landlord--
the
commission
on
letting
and
receiving
the
rentals
of
such
a
property
is
no
joke
to
me
precisely
said
the
landlord
i
thought
it
was
better
to
come
and
tell
you
at
once
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
is
enormously
rich
if
that
be
satisfactorily
proved
it's
of
no
consequence
what
he
is
or
who
he
is
and
you
may
depend
i
shall
be
round
to
the
inn
early
in
the
morning
to
attend
upon
him
and
in
that
case
perhaps
if
you
have
any
conversation
with
him
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
mention
that
i
will
show
him
over
the
premises
at
his
own
hour
and
you
shall
not
be
forgotten
you
may
depend
if
any
arrangement
is
actually
come
to
it
will
be
just
as
well
for
you
to
tell
him
what
a
nice
property
it
is
and
that
it
is
to
be
let
for
eight
hundred
a
year
or
sold
outright
for
eight
thousand
pounds
i
will
you
may
depend
mr
leek
a
most
extraordinary
man
you
will
find
him
not
the
handsomest
in
the
world
i
can
tell
you
but
handsome
is
as
handsome
does
say
i
and
if
he
takes
anderbury-on-the-mount
i
have
no
doubt
but
he
will
spend
a
lot
of
money
in
the
neighbourhood
and
we
shall
all
be
the
better
of
that
of
course
as
you
well
know
sir
this
then
was
thoroughly
agreed
upon
between
these
high
contracting
powers
and
the
landlord
returned
home
very
well
satisfied
indeed
with
the
position
in
which
he
had
put
the
affair
and
resolved
upon
urging
on
the
baron
as
far
as
it
lay
within
his
power
so
to
do
to
establish
himself
in
the
neighbourhood
and
to
allow
him
to
be
purveyor-in-general
to
his
household
which
if
the
baron
continued
in
his
liberal
humour
would
be
unquestionably
a
very
pleasant
post
to
occupy
the
visitor
and
the
death
in
the
subterranean
passage
illustration
about
an
hour
and
a
half
after
the
baron
had
retired
to
rest
and
while
the
landlord
was
still
creeping
about
enjoining
silence
on
the
part
of
the
establishment
so
that
the
slumbers
of
a
wealthy
and
no
doubt
illustrious
personage
should
not
be
disturbed
there
arrived
a
horseman
at
the
anderbury
arms
he
was
rather
a
singular-looking
man
with
a
shifting
uneasy-looking
glance
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
being
suddenly
pounced
upon
and
surprised
by
some
one
and
although
his
apparel
was
plain
yet
it
was
good
in
quality
and
his
whole
appearance
was
such
as
to
induce
respectful
attention
the
only
singular
circumstance
was
that
such
a
traveller
so
well
mounted
should
be
alone
but
that
might
have
been
his
own
fancy
so
that
the
absence
of
an
attendant
went
for
nothing
doubtless
if
the
whole
inn
had
not
been
in
such
a
commotion
about
the
illustrious
and
wealthy
baron
this
stranger
would
have
received
more
consideration
and
attention
than
he
did
upon
alighting
he
walked
at
once
into
what
is
called
the
coffee-room
of
the
hotel
and
after
ordering
some
refreshments
of
which
he
partook
but
sparingly
he
said
in
a
mild
but
solemn
sort
of
tone
to
the
waiter
who
attended
upon
him--
tell
the
baron
stolmuyer
of
saltzburgh
that
there
is
one
here
who
wants
to
see
him
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
the
waiter
but
the
baron
is
gone
to
bed
it
matters
not
to
me
if
you
nor
no
one
else
in
this
establishment
will
deliver
the
message
i
charge
you
with
i
must
do
so
myself
i'll
speak
to
my
master
sir
but
the
baron
is
a
very
great
gentleman
indeed
and
i
don't
think
my
master
would
like
to
have
him
disturbed
the
stranger
hesitated
for
a
time
and
then
he
said--
show
me
the
baron's
apartment
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
ask
any
one
person
connected
with
this
establishment
to
disturb
him
when
i
am
quite
willing
to
do
so
myself
show
me
the
way
well
but
sir
the
baron
may
get
in
a
rage
and
say
very
naturally
that
we
had
no
business
to
let
anybody
walk
up
to
his
room
and
disturb
him
because
we
wouldn't
do
so
ourselves
so
that
you
see
sir
when
you
come
to
consider
it
hardly
seems
the
right
sort
of
thing
since
said
the
stranger
rising
i
cannot
procure
even
the
common
courtesy
of
being
shown
to
the
apartment
of
the
person
whom
i
seek
i
must
find
him
myself
as
he
spoke
he
walked
out
of
the
room
and
began
ascending
the
staircase
despite
the
remonstrances
of
the
waiter
who
called
after
him
repeatedly
but
could
not
induce
him
to
stop
and
when
he
found
that
such
was
the
case
he
made
his
way
to
the
landlord
to
give
the
alarm
that
for
all
he
knew
to
the
contrary
some
one
had
gone
up
stairs
to
murder
the
baron
this
information
threw
the
landlord
into
such
a
fix
that
he
knew
not
what
to
be
at
at
one
moment
he
was
for
rushing
up
stairs
and
endeavouring
to
interfere
and
at
another
he
thought
the
best
plan
would
be
to
pretend
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
while
he
was
in
this
state
of
uncertainty
the
stranger
succeeded
in
making
his
way
up
stairs
to
the
floor
from
which
proceeded
the
bedrooms
and
apparently
having
no
fear
whatever
of
the
baron
stolmuyer's
indignation
before
his
eyes
he
opened
door
after
door
until
he
came
to
one
which
led
him
into
the
apartment
occupied
by
that
illustrious
individual
the
baron
half
undressed
only
lay
in
an
uneasy
slumber
upon
the
bed
and
the
stranger
stood
opposite
to
him
for
some
minutes
as
if
considering
what
he
should
do
it
would
be
easy
he
said
to
kill
him
but
it
will
pay
me
better
to
spare
him
i
may
be
wrong
in
supposing
that
he
has
the
means
which
i
hope
he
has
but
that
i
shall
soon
discover
by
his
conversation
stretching
out
his
hand
he
tapped
the
baron
lightly
on
the
shoulder
who
thereupon
opened
his
eyes
and
sprang
to
his
feet
instantly
glancing
with
fixed
earnestness
at
the
intruder
upon
whose
face
shone
the
light
of
a
lamp
which
was
burning
in
the
apartment
then
the
baron
shrunk
back
and
the
stranger
folding
his
arms
said--
you
know
me
let
our
interview
be
as
brief
as
possible
there
needs
no
explanations
between
us
for
we
both
know
all
that
could
be
said
by
some
accident
you
have
become
rich
while
i
continue
quite
otherwise
it
matters
not
how
this
has
occurred
the
fact
is
everything
i
don't
know
the
amount
of
your
possessions
but
from
your
style
of
living
they
must
be
great
and
therefore
it
is
that
i
make
no
hesitation
in
asking
of
you
as
a
price
for
not
exposing
who
and
what
you
are
a
moderate
sum
i
thought
that
you
were
dead
i
know
you
did
but
you
behold
me
here
and
consequently
that
delusion
vanishes
what
sum
do
you
require
and
what
assurance
can
i
have
that
when
you
get
it
the
demand
will
not
be
repeated
on
the
first
opportunity
i
can
give
you
no
such
assurance
perhaps
that
would
satisfy
you
entirely
but
for
more
reasons
than
i
choose
to
enter
into
i
am
extremely
anxious
to
leave
england
at
once
and
forever
give
me
the
power
to
do
so
that
i
require
and
you
will
never
hear
of
me
again
illustration
the
baron
hesitated
for
some
few
seconds
during
which
he
looked
scrutinizingly
at
his
companion
and
then
he
said
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
seemed
as
if
he
were
making
the
remark
to
himself
rather
than
to
the
other--
you
look
no
older
than
you
did
when
last
we
parted
and
that
was
years
ago
why
should
i
look
older
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
i
need
not
but
to
be
brief
i
do
not
wish
to
interfere
with
any
plans
or
projects
you
may
have
on
hand
i
do
not
wish
to
be
a
hindrance
to
you
let
me
have
five
thousand
pounds
and
i
am
off
at
once
and
forever
i
tell
you
five
thousand
the
man
raves--five
thousand
pounds
say
one
thousand
and
it
is
yours
no
i
have
fixed
my
price
and
if
you
do
not
consent
i
now
tell
you
that
i
will
blazon
forth
even
in
this
house
who
and
what
you
are
and
let
your
schemes
of
ambition
or
of
cupidity
be
what
they
may
you
may
be
assured
that
i
will
blast
them
all
this
is
no
place
in
which
to
argue
such
a
point
come
out
into
the
open
air
'walls
have
ears'
but
come
out
and
i
will
give
you
such
special
reasons
why
you
should
not
now
press
your
claim
at
all
that
you
shall
feel
much
beholden
to
me
for
them
and
not
regret
your
visit
if
that
we
come
to
terms
i
no
more
desire
than
you
can
do
that
any
one
should
overhear
our
conversation
i
prefer
the
open
air
for
any
conference
be
it
whatever
it
may--much
prefer
it
and
therefore
most
willingly
embrace
your
proposition
come
out
the
baron
put
on
his
travelling
cap
and
the
rich
velvet
cloak
edged
with
fur
that
he
possessed
and
leaving
his
chamber
a
few
paces
in
advance
of
his
strange
visitor
he
descended
the
staircase
followed
by
him
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
they
found
the
landlord
and
almost
the
whole
of
the
establishment
assembled
in
deep
consultation
as
to
whether
or
not
any
one
was
to
go
up
stairs
and
ascertain
if
the
stranger
who
had
sought
the
baron's
chamber
was
really
a
friend
or
an
enemy
but
when
they
saw
the
two
men
coming
down
at
all
events
apparently
amicably
it
was
a
great
relief
and
the
landlord
rushed
forward
and
opened
the
door
for
which
piece
of
service
he
got
a
very
stately
bow
from
the
baron
and
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
from
his
visitor
and
then
they
both
passed
out
i
have
ascertained
said
the
man
who
came
on
horseback
that
for
the
last
week
in
london
you
have
lived
in
a
style
of
the
most
princely
magnificence
and
that
you
came
down
here
attended
as
if
you
were
one
of
the
first
nobles
of
the
land
these
things
amuse
the
vulgar
said
the
baron
i
do
not
mind
admitting
to
you
that
i
contemplate
residing
on
this
spot
and
perhaps
contracting
a
marriage
another
marriage
and
why
not
if
wives
will
die
suddenly
and
no
one
knows
why
who
is
to
help
it
i
do
not
pretend
to
control
the
fates
this
between
us
is
idle
talk
indeed--most
idle
for
we
know
there
are
certain
circumstances
which
account
for
the
strangest
phenomena
but
what
roaring
sound
is
that
which
comes
so
regularly
and
steadily
upon
the
ear
it
is
the
sea
washing
upon
the
coast
the
tide
is
no
doubt
advancing
and
as
the
eddying
surges
roll
in
upon
the
pebbly
shore
they
make
what
to
my
mind
is
this
pleasant
music
i
did
not
think
we
were
so
near
the
ocean
the
moon
is
rising
let
us
walk
upon
the
beach
and
as
that
sound
is
such
pleasant
music
you
shall
hear
it
while
i
convince
you
what
unpleasant
consequences
will
arise
from
a
refusal
of
the
modest
and
moderate
terms
i
offer
you
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
but
i
must
confess
it
does
seem
to
me
most
extraordinary
that
you
ask
of
me
a
positive
fortune
for
fear
you
should
deprive
me
of
a
portion
of
one
but
you
cannot
mean
what
you
say
while
they
were
talking
they
reached
a
long
strip
of
sand
which
was
by
the
seashore
at
the
base
of
some
cliffs
through
which
was
excavated
the
passage
from
the
coast
into
the
grounds
of
anderbury
house
and
which
had
been
so
expatiated
upon
by
the
landlord
of
the
inn
in
his
description
of
the
advantages
attendant
upon
that
property
there
were
some
rude
steps
leading
to
a
narrow
arched
door-way
which
constituted
an
entrance
to
this
subterraneous
region
and
as
the
moonlight
streamed
over
the
wide
waste
of
waters
and
fell
upon
this
little
door-way
in
the
face
of
the
cliff
he
became
convinced
that
it
was
the
entrance
to
that
excavation
and
he
eyed
it
curiously
what
place
is
that
said
his
companion
it
is
a
private
entrance
to
the
grounds
of
a
mansion
in
this
neighbourhood
private
enough
i
should
presume
for
if
there
be
any
other
means
of
reaching
the
house
surely
no
one
would
go
through
such
a
dismal
hole
as
that
towards
it
but
come
make
up
your
mind
at
once
there
need
be
no
quarrelling
upon
the
subject
of
our
conference
but
let
it
be
a
plain
matter
of
yes
or
no
is
it
worth
your
while
to
be
left
alone
in
peace
or
is
it
not
it
is
worth
my
while
but
not
at
such
a
price
as
that
you
mentioned
and
i
cannot
help
thinking
that
some
cheaper
mode
of
accomplishing
the
same
object
will
surely
present
itself
very
shortly
i
do
not
understand
you
you
talk
ambiguously
but
my
acts
said
the
baron
shall
be
clear
and
plain
enough
as
you
shall
see
could
you
believe
it
possible
that
i
was
the
sort
of
person
to
submit
tamely
to
any
amount
of
extortion
you
chose
to
practise
upon
me
there
was
a
time
when
i
thought
you
possessed
great
sense
and
judgment
when
i
thought
that
you
were
a
man
who
weighed
well
the
chances
of
what
you
were
about
but
now
i
know
to
the
contrary
and
i
think
for
less
than
a
thousand
pounds
i
may
succeed
in
ridding
myself
of
you
i
do
not
understand
you
you
had
better
beware
how
you
tamper
with
me
for
i
am
not
one
who
will
be
calmly
disposed
to
put
up
with
much
the
sense
tact
and
worldly
knowledge
which
you
say
you
have
before
from
time
to
time
given
me
credit
for
belongs
to
me
still
and
i
am
not
likely
easily
to
commit
myself
indeed
do
you
think
you
bear
such
a
charmed
life
that
nothing
can
shake
it
i
think
nothing
of
the
sort
but
i
know
what
i
can
do--i
am
armed
and
i
and
since
it
comes
to
this
take
the
reward
of
your
villany
for
it
was
you
who
made
me
what
i
am
and
would
now
seek
to
destroy
my
every
hope
of
satisfaction
as
the
baron
spoke
he
drew
from
his
breast
a
small
pistol
which
with
the
quickness
of
thought
he
held
full
in
the
face
of
his
companion
and
pulled
the
trigger
there
can
be
no
doubt
on
earth
that
his
intention
was
to
commit
the
murder
but
the
pistol
missed
fire
and
he
was
defeated
in
his
intention
at
that
moment
then
the
stranger
laughed
scornfully
and
drawing
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
he
presented
it
at
the
baron's
head
saying--
do
i
not
bear
a
charmed
life
if
i
had
not
should
i
have
escaped
death
from
you
now
no
i
could
not
but
you
perceive
that
even
a
weapon
that
might
not
fail
you
upon
another
occasion
is
harmless
against
me
and
can
you
expect
that
i
will
hesitate
now
to
take
full
and
ample
revenge
upon
you
for
this
dastardly
attempt
these
words
were
spoken
with
great
volubility
so
much
so
indeed
that
they
only
occupied
a
few
very
brief
seconds
in
delivering
and
then
perhaps
the
baron's
career
might
have
ended
for
it
seemed
to
be
fully
the
intention
of
the
other
to
conclude
what
he
said
by
firing
the
pistol
in
his
face
but
the
wily
aspect
of
the
baron's
countenance
was
after
all
but
a
fair
index
of
the
mind
and
just
as
the
last
words
passed
the
lips
of
his
irritated
companion
he
suddenly
dropped
in
a
crouching
position
to
the
ground
and
seizing
his
legs
threw
him
over
his
head
in
an
instant
the
pistol
was
discharged
at
the
same
moment
and
then
with
a
shout
of
rage
and
satisfaction
the
baron
sprang
upon
his
foe
and
kneeling
upon
his
breast
he
held
aloft
in
his
hand
a
glittering
dagger
the
highly-polished
blade
of
which
caught
the
moonbeams
and
reflected
them
into
the
dazzled
eyes
of
the
conquered
man
whose
fate
now
appeared
to
be
certain
fool
said
the
baron
you
must
needs
then
try
conclusions
with
me
and
not
content
with
the
safety
of
insignificance
you
must
be
absurd
enough
to
think
it
possible
you
could
extort
from
me
whatever
sums
your
fancy
dictated
or
with
any
effect
threaten
me
if
i
complied
not
with
your
desires
have
mercy
upon
me
i
meant
not
to
take
your
life
and
therefore
why
should
you
take
mine
you
would
have
taken
it
and
therefore
you
shall
die
know
too
as
this
is
your
last
moment
that
vampyre
as
you
are
and
as
i
of
all
men
best
know
you
to
be
i
will
take
especial
care
that
you
shall
be
placed
in
some
position
after
death
where
the
revivifying
moonbeams
may
not
touch
you
so
that
this
shall
truly
be
your
end
and
you
shall
rot
away
leaving
no
trace
behind
of
your
existence
sufficient
to
contain
the
vital
principle
no--no
you
cannot--will
not
you
will
have
mercy
ask
the
famished
tiger
for
mercy
when
you
intrude
upon
his
den
as
he
spoke
the
baron
ground
his
teeth
together
with
rage
and
in
an
instant
buried
the
poniard
in
the
throat
of
his
victim
the
blade
went
through
to
the
yellow
sand
beneath
and
the
murderer
still
knelt
upon
the
man's
chest
while
he
who
had
thus
received
so
fatal
a
blow
tossed
his
arms
about
with
agony
and
tried
in
vain
to
shriek
the
nature
of
the
wound
however
prevented
him
from
uttering
anything
but
a
low
gurgling
sound
for
he
was
nearly
choked
with
his
own
blood
and
soon
his
eyes
became
fixed
and
of
a
glassy
appearance
he
stretched
out
his
two
arms
and
dug
his
fingers
deep
into
the
sand
the
baron
drew
forth
the
poniard
and
a
gush
of
blood
immediately
followed
it
and
then
one
deep
groan
testified
to
the
fact
that
the
spirit
if
there
be
a
spirit
had
left
its
mortal
habitation
and
winged
its
flight
to
other
realms
if
there
be
other
realms
for
it
to
wing
its
flight
to
he
is
dead
said
the
baron
and
at
the
same
moment
a
roll
of
the
advancing
tide
swept
over
the
body
drenching
the
living
as
well
as
the
dead
with
the
brine
of
the
ocean
the
baron
stooped
and
rinsed
the
dagger
in
the
advancing
tide
from
the
clotted
blood
which
had
clung
to
it
and
then
wiping
it
carefully
he
returned
it
to
its
sheath
which
was
hidden
within
the
folds
of
his
dress
and
rising
from
his
kneeling
posture
upon
the
body
he
stood
by
its
side
with
folded
arms
gazing
upon
it
for
some
minutes
in
silence
heedless
of
the
still
advancing
water
which
was
already
considerably
above
his
feet
then
he
spoke
in
his
ordinary
accents
and
evidently
caring
nothing
for
the
fact
that
he
had
done
such
a
deed
i
must
dispose
of
this
carcase
he
said
which
now
seems
so
lifeless
for
the
moon
is
up
and
if
its
beams
fall
upon
it
i
know
from
former
experience
what
will
happen
it
will
rise
again
and
walk
the
earth
seeking
for
vengeance
upon
me
and
the
thirst
for
that
vengeance
will
become
such
a
part
of
its
very
nature
that
it
will
surely
accomplish
something
if
not
all
that
it
desires
after
a
few
moments'
consideration
he
stooped
and
with
more
strength
than
one
would
have
thought
it
possible
a
man
reduced
almost
as
he
was
to
a
skeleton
could
have
exerted
he
lifted
the
body
and
carried
it
rapidly
up
the
beach
towards
the
cliffs
he
threw
it
down
upon
the
stone
steps
that
led
to
the
small
door
of
the
excavation
in
the
cliff
and
it
fell
upon
them
with
a
sickening
sound
as
if
some
of
the
bones
were
surely
broken
by
the
fall
the
object
then
of
the
baron
seemed
to
be
to
get
this
door
open
if
he
possibly
could
but
that
was
an
object
easier
to
be
desired
than
carried
into
effect
for
although
he
exerted
his
utmost
power
he
did
not
succeed
in
moving
it
an
inch
and
he
began
evidently
to
think
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
so
but
yet
he
did
not
give
up
the
attempt
at
once
but
looking
about
upon
the
beach
until
he
found
a
large
heavy
stone
he
raised
it
in
his
arms
and
approaching
the
door
he
flung
it
against
it
with
such
tremendous
force
that
it
flew
open
instantly
disclosing
within
a
dark
and
narrow
passage
apparently
rejoiced
that
he
had
accomplished
this
much
he
stopped
cautiously
within
the
entrance
and
then
taking
from
a
concealed
pocket
that
was
in
the
velvet
cloak
which
he
wore
a
little
box
he
produced
from
it
some
wax-lights
and
some
chemical
matches
which
by
the
slightest
effort
he
succeeded
in
igniting
and
then
with
one
of
the
lights
in
his
hand
to
guide
him
on
his
way
he
went
on
exploring
the
passage
and
treading
with
extreme
caution
as
he
went
for
fear
of
falling
into
any
of
the
ice-wells
which
were
reported
to
be
in
that
place
after
proceeding
about
twenty
yards
and
finding
that
there
was
no
danger
he
became
less
cautious
but
in
consequence
of
such
less
caution
he
very
nearly
sacrificed
his
life
for
he
came
upon
an
ice-well
which
seemed
a
considerable
depth
and
into
which
he
had
nearly
plunged
headlong
he
started
back
with
some
degree
of
horror
but
that
soon
left
him
and
then
after
a
moment's
thought
he
sought
for
some
little
nook
in
the
wall
in
which
he
might
place
the
candle
and
soon
finding
one
that
answered
the
purpose
well
he
there
left
it
having
all
the
appearance
of
a
little
shrine
while
he
proceeded
again
to
the
mouth
of
that
singular
and
cavernous-looking
place
he
had
evidently
quite
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
for
without
a
moment's
hesitation
he
lifted
the
body
again
and
carried
it
within
the
entrance
walking
boldly
and
firmly
now
that
he
knew
there
was
no
danger
between
him
and
the
light
which
shed
a
gleam
through
the
darkness
of
the
place
of
a
very
faint
and
flickering
character
he
reached
it
rapidly
and
when
he
got
to
the
side
of
the
well
he
without
a
moment's
hesitation
flung
it
headlong
down
and
listening
attentively
he
heard
it
fall
with
a
slight
plash
as
if
there
was
some
water
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
it
was
an
annoyance
however
for
him
to
find
that
the
distance
was
not
so
deep
as
he
had
anticipated
and
when
he
took
the
light
from
the
niche
where
he
had
placed
it
and
looked
earnestly
down
he
could
see
the
livid
ghastly-looking
face
of
the
dead
man
for
the
body
had
accidentally
fallen
upon
its
back
which
was
a
circumstance
he
had
not
counted
upon
and
one
which
increased
the
chances
greatly
of
its
being
seen
should
any
one
be
exploring
from
curiosity
that
not
very
inviting
place
this
was
annoyance
but
how
could
it
be
prevented
unless
indeed
he
chose
to
descend
and
make
an
alteration
in
the
disposition
of
the
corpse
but
this
was
evidently
what
he
did
not
choose
to
do
so
after
muttering
to
himself
a
few
words
expressive
of
his
intention
to
leave
it
where
it
was
he
replaced
the
candle
after
extinguishing
it
in
the
box
from
whence
he
had
taken
it
and
carefully
walked
out
of
the
dismal
place
the
moonbeams
were
shining
very
brightly
and
beautifully
upon
the
face
of
the
cliffs
when
he
emerged
from
the
subterranean
passage
so
that
he
could
see
the
door
the
steps
and
every
object
quite
distinctly
and
to
his
gratification
he
found
that
he
had
not
destroyed
any
fastening
that
was
to
the
door
but
that
when
it
was
slammed
shut
it
struck
so
hard
and
fast
that
the
strength
of
one
man
could
not
possibly
move
it
even
the
smallest
fraction
of
an
inch
i
shall
be
shown
all
this
to-morrow
he
said
and
if
i
take
this
house
i
must
have
an
alteration
made
in
this
door
so
that
it
may
open
with
a
lock
instead
of
by
main
violence
as
at
present
but
if
in
the
morning
when
i
view
anderbury
house
i
can
avoid
an
entrance
into
this
region
i
will
do
so
and
at
my
leisure
if
i
become
the
possessor
of
the
estate
i
can
explore
every
nook
and
cranny
of
it
he
then
folded
his
cloak
about
him
after
pulling
the
door
as
closely
as
he
could
he
walked
slowly
and
thoughtfully
back
to
the
inn
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
idea
of
the
murder
he
had
committed
did
not
annoy
him
in
the
least
and
that
in
his
speculations
upon
the
subject
he
congratulated
himself
much
upon
having
so
far
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
certainly
a
most
troublesome
acquaintance
'tis
well
indeed
he
said
that
just
at
this
juncture
he
should
throw
himself
in
my
way
and
enable
me
so
easy
to
feel
certain
that
i
shall
never
more
be
troubled
with
him
truly
i
ran
some
risk
and
when
my
pistol
missed
fire
it
seemed
as
if
my
evil
star
was
in
its
ascendant
and
that
i
was
doomed
myself
to
become
the
victim
of
him
whom
i
have
laid
in
so
cold
a
grave
but
i
have
been
victorious
and
i
am
willing
to
accept
the
circumstance
as
an
omen
of
the
past--that
my
fortunes
are
on
the
change
i
think
i
shall
be
successful
now
and
with
the
ample
means
which
i
now
possess
surely
in
this
country
where
gold
is
loved
so
well
i
shall
be
able
to
overcome
all
difficulties
and
to
unite
myself
to
some
one
who--but
no
matter
her
fate
is
an
after
consideration
the
marriage
in
the
bannerworth
family
arranged
illustration
after
the
adventure
of
the
doctor
with
regard
to
the
picture
about
which
such
an
air
of
mystery
and
interest
has
been
thrown
the
bannerworth
family
began
to
give
up
all
hopes
of
ever
finding
a
clue
to
those
circumstances
concerning
which
they
would
certainly
have
liked
to
have
known
the
truth
but
of
which
it
was
not
likely
they
would
ever
hear
anything
more
dr
chillingworth
now
had
no
reserve
and
when
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
feel
that
he
could
converse
without
an
effort
he
took
an
opportunity
while
the
whole
of
the
family
were
present
to
speak
of
what
had
been
his
hopes
and
his
expectations
you
are
all
aware
he
said
now
of
the
story
of
marmaduke
bannerworth
and
what
an
excessively
troublesome
person
he
was
with
all
deference
to
you
henry
first
of
all
as
to
spending
all
his
money
at
the
gaming-table
and
leaving
his
family
destitute
and
then
when
he
did
get
a
lump
of
money
which
might
have
done
some
good
to
those
he
left
behind
him--hiding
it
somewhere
where
it
could
not
be
found
at
all
and
so
leaving
you
all
in
great
difficulty
and
distress
when
you
might
have
been
independent
that's
true
enough
doctor
said
henry
but
you
know
the
old
proverb--that
ill-gotten
wealth
never
thrives
so
that
i
don't
regret
not
finding
this
money
for
i
am
sure
we
should
have
been
none
the
happier
with
it
and
perhaps
not
so
happy
oh
bother
the
old
proverb
thirty
or
forty
thousand
pounds
is
no
trifle
to
be
talked
lightly
of
or
the
loss
of
which
to
be
quietly
put
up
with
on
account
of
a
musty
proverb
it's
a
large
sum
and
i
should
like
to
have
placed
it
in
your
hands
but
as
you
cannot
doctor
there
can
be
no
good
possibly
done
by
regretting
it
no
certainly
i
don't
mean
that
utter
regret
is
always
a
very
foolish
thing
but
it's
questionable
whether
something
might
not
be
done
in
the
matter
after
all
for
you
as
it
appears
by
all
the
evidence
we
can
collect
that
it
must
have
been
varney
after
all
who
jumped
down
upon
me
from
the
garden-wall
in
so
sudden
a
manner
and
if
the
picture
be
valuable
to
him
it
must
be
valuable
to
us
but
how
are
we
to
get
it
and
if
we
could
i
do
not
see
that
it
would
be
of
much
good
to
anybody
for
after
all
it
is
but
a
painting
there
you
go
again
said
the
doctor
depreciating
what
you
know
nothing
about
now
listen
to
me
master
henry
and
i
will
tell
you
that
picture
evidently
had
some
sort
of
lining
at
the
back
over
the
original
canvas
and
do
you
think
i
would
have
taken
such
pains
to
bring
it
away
with
me
if
that
lining
had
not
made
me
suspect
that
between
it
and
the
original
picture
the
money
in
bank
notes
was
deposited
had
you
any
special
reason
for
supposing
such
was
the
case
yes
most
unquestionably
i
had
for
when
i
got
the
picture
fairly
down
i
found
various
inequalities
in
the
surface
of
the
back
which
led
me
to
believe
that
rolls
of
notes
were
deposited
and
that
the
great
mistake
we
had
all
along
made
was
in
looking
behind
the
picture
instead
of
at
the
picture
itself
i
meant
immediately
to
have
cut
it
to
pieces
when
i
reached
here
with
it
but
now
it
has
got
into
the
hands
of
somebody
else
who
knows
i
suspect
as
much
i
do
it
is
rather
provoking
rather
provoking
is
that
the
way
to
talk
of
the
loss
of
heaven
knows
how
many
thousands
of
pounds
i
am
quite
aggravated
myself
at
the
idea
of
the
thing
and
it
puts
me
in
a
perfect
fever
to
think
of
it
i
can
assure
you
but
what
can
we
do
oh
i
propose
an
immediate
crusade
against
varney
the
vampyre
for
who
but
he
could
have
made
such
an
attack
upon
me
and
force
me
to
deliver
up
such
a
valuable
treasure
never
heed
it
doctor
said
flora
let
it
go
we
have
never
had
or
enjoyed
that
money
so
it
cannot
matter
and
it
is
not
to
be
considered
as
the
loss
of
an
actual
possession
because
we
never
did
actually
possess
it
yes
chimed
in
the
admiral
bother
the
money
what
do
we
care
about
it
and
besides
charley
holland
is
going
to
be
very
busy
busy
said
the
doctor
how
do
you
mean
why
isn't
he
going
to
be
married
directly
to
flora
here
and
am
not
i
going
to
settle
the
whole
of
my
property
upon
him
on
condition
that
he
takes
the
name
of
bell
instead
of
holland
for
you
see
his
mother
was
my
sister
and
of
course
her
name
was
bell
as
for
his
father
holland
it
can't
matter
to
him
now
what
charley
is
called
and
if
he
don't
take
the
name
of
bell
i
shall
be
the
last
in
the
family
for
i
am
not
likely
to
marry
and
have
any
little
bells
about
me
no
said
the
doctor
i
should
say
not
and
that's
the
reason
why
you
want
to
ring
the
changes
upon
charles
holland's
name
do
you
see
the
joke
admiral
i
can't
say
i
do--where
is
it
it's
all
very
well
to
talk
of
jokes
but
if
i
was
like
charles
going
to
be
married
i
shouldn't
be
in
any
joking
humour
i
can
tell
you
but
quite
the
reverse
and
as
for
you
and
your
picture
if
you
want
it
doctor
just
run
after
varney
yourself
for
it
or
stay--i
have
a
better
idea
than
that--get
your
wife
to
go
and
ask
him
for
it
and
if
she
makes
half
such
a
clamour
about
his
ears
that
she
did
about
ours
he
will
give
it
her
in
a
minute
to
get
rid
of
her
my
wife--you
don't
mean
to
say
she
has
been
here
yes
but
she
has
though
and
now
doctor
i
can
tell
you
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
service
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
of
course
picked
up
a
little
experience
and
if
i
were
you
some
of
these
days
when
mrs
chillingworth
ain't
very
well
i'd
give
her
a
composing
draught
that
would
make
her
quiet
enough
ah
that's
not
my
style
of
practice
admiral
but
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
mrs
chillingworth
has
annoyed
you
so
much
pho
pho
man--pho
pho
do
you
think
she
could
annoy
me
why
i
have
encountered
storms
and
squalls
in
all
latitudes
and
it
isn't
a
woman's
tongue
now
that
can
do
anything
of
an
annoying
character
i
can
tell
you
far
from
it--very
far
from
it
so
don't
distress
yourself
upon
that
head
but
come
doctor
we
are
going
to
have
the
wedding
the
day
after
to-morrow
no
no
said
flora
the
week
after
next
you
mean
is
it
the
week
after
next
i'll
be
hanged
if
i
didn't
think
it
was
the
day
after
to-morrow
but
of
course
you
know
best
as
you
have
settled
it
all
among
you
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
of
course
i
shall
with
great
pleasure
returned
the
doctor
be
present
on
the
interesting
occasion
but
do
you
intend
taking
possession
of
bannerworth
hall
again
no
certainly
not
said
henry
we
propose
going
to
the
dearbrook
estate
and
there
remaining
for
a
time
to
see
how
we
all
like
it
we
may
perchance
enjoy
it
very
much
for
i
have
heard
it
spoken
of
as
an
attractive
little
property
enough
and
one
that
any
one
might
fancy
after
being
resident
a
short
time
upon
it
well
said
the
admiral
that
is
i
believe
settled
among
us
but
i
am
sure
we
sha'n't
like
it
on
account
of
the
want
of
the
sea
why
i
tell
you
i
have
not
seen
a
ship
myself
for
this
eighteen
months
there's
a
state
of
things
you
see
that
won't
do
to
last
because
one
would
get
dry-mouldy
it's
a
shocking
thing
to
see
nothing
but
land
land
wherever
you
go
from
the
preceding
conversation
may
be
gathered
what
were
the
designs
of
the
bannerworth
family
and
what
progress
had
been
made
in
carrying
them
out
from
the
moment
they
had
discovered
the
title-deeds
of
the
dearbrook
property
they
had
ceased
to
care
about
the
large
sum
of
money
which
marmaduke
bannerworth
had
been
supposed
to
have
hidden
in
some
portion
of
bannerworth
hall
they
had
already
passed
through
quite
enough
of
the
busy
turmoils
of
existence
to
be
grateful
for
anything
that
promised
ease
and
competence
and
that
serenity
of
mind
which
is
the
dearest
possession
which
any
one
can
compass
consequently
was
it
that
with
one
accord
they
got
rid
of
all
yearning
after
the
large
sum
which
the
doctor
was
so
anxious
to
procure
for
them
and
looked
forward
to
a
life
of
great
happiness
and
contentment
on
the
whole
too
when
they
came
to
talk
the
matter
over
quietly
among
themselves
they
were
not
sorry
that
varney
had
taken
himself
off
in
the
way
he
had
for
really
it
was
a
great
release
and
as
he
had
couched
his
farewell
in
words
which
signified
it
was
a
final
one
they
were
inclined
to
think
that
he
must
have
left
england
and
that
it
was
not
likely
they
should
ever
again
encounter
him
under
any
circumstances
whatever
it
was
to
be
considered
quite
as
a
whim
of
the
old
admiral's
the
changing
of
charles
holland's
name
to
bell
but
as
charles
himself
said
when
the
subject
was
broached
to
him--i
am
so
well
content
to
be
called
whatever
those
to
whom
i
feel
affection
think
proper
that
i
give
up
my
name
of
holland
without
a
pang
willingly
adopting
in
its
stead
one
that
has
always
been
hallowed
in
my
remembrance
with
the
best
and
kindest
recollections
and
thus
this
affair
was
settled
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
flora
who
was
quite
as
well
content
to
be
called
mrs
bell
as
to
be
called
mrs
holland
since
the
object
of
her
attachment
remained
the
same
the
wedding
was
really
fixed
for
the
week
after
that
which
followed
the
conversation
we
have
recorded
but
the
admiral
was
not
at
all
disposed
to
allow
flora
and
his
nephew
charles
to
get
through
such
an
important
period
of
their
lives
without
some
greater
demonstration
and
show
than
could
be
made
from
the
little
cottage
where
they
dwelt
and
consequently
he
wished
that
they
should
leave
that
and
proceed
at
once
to
a
larger
mansion
which
he
had
his
eye
upon
a
few
miles
off
and
which
was
to
be
had
furnished
for
a
time
at
the
pleasure
of
any
one
and
we
won't
shut
ourselves
up
said
the
admiral
but
we
will
find
out
all
the
christian-like
people
in
the
neighbourhood
and
invite
them
to
the
wedding
and
we
will
have
a
jolly
good
breakfast
together
and
lots
of
music
and
a
famous
lunch
and
after
that
a
dinner
and
then
a
dance
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
so
that
there
shall
be
no
want
of
fun
as
may
be
well
supposed
both
charles
and
flora
shrunk
from
so
public
an
affair
but
as
the
old
man
had
evidently
set
his
heart
upon
it
they
did
not
like
to
say
they
positively
would
not
so
after
a
vain
attempt
to
dissuade
him
from
removing
at
all
from
the
cottage
until
they
removed
for
good
they
gave
up
the
point
to
him
and
he
had
it
all
his
own
way
he
took
the
house
for
one
month
which
had
so
taken
his
fancy
and
certainly
a
pretty
enough
place
it
was
although
they
found
out
afterwards
that
why
it
was
he
was
so
charmed
with
it
consisted
in
the
fact
that
it
bore
the
name
of
a
vessel
which
he
had
once
commanded
but
this
they
did
not
know
until
a
long
time
afterwards
when
it
slipped
out
by
mere
accident
they
stipulated
with
the
admiral
that
there
should
not
be
more
than
twenty
guests
at
the
breakfast
which
was
to
succeed
the
marriage
ceremony
and
to
that
he
acceded
but
henry
whispered
to
charles
holland--
i
know
this
public
wedding
to
be
distasteful
to
you
and
most
particularly
do
i
know
it
is
distasteful
to
flora
so
if
you
do
not
mind
playing
a
trick
upon
the
old
man
i
can
very
easily
put
you
in
the
way
of
cheating
him
entirely
indeed
i
should
like
to
hear
and
what
is
more
i
should
like
to
practise
if
you
think
it
will
not
so
entirely
offend
him
as
to
make
him
implacable
not
at
all
not
at
all
he
will
laugh
himself
when
he
comes
to
know
it
as
much
as
any
of
us
the
present
difficulty
will
be
to
procure
flora's
connivance
but
that
we
must
do
the
best
way
we
can
by
persuasion
what
this
scheme
was
will
ultimately
appear
but
certain
it
is
that
the
old
admiral
had
no
suspicion
of
what
was
going
on
and
proceeded
to
make
all
his
arrangements
accordingly
from
his
first
arrival
in
the
market
town--in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
was
bannerworth
hall--it
will
be
recollected
that
he
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
the
lawyer
in
whose
name
a
forged
letter
had
been
sent
him
informing
him
of
the
fact
that
his
nephew
charles
holland
intended
marrying
into
a
family
of
vampyres
it
was
this
letter
as
the
reader
is
aware
which
brought
the
old
admiral
and
jack
pringle
into
the
neighbourhood
of
the
hall
and
although
it
was
a
manoeuvre
to
get
rid
of
charles
holland
which
failed
most
signally
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
such
a
letter
was
the
production
of
sir
francis
varney
and
that
he
wrote
it
for
the
express
purpose
of
getting
rid
of
charles
from
the
hall
who
had
begun
materially
to
interfere
with
his
plans
and
projects
there
after
some
conversation
with
himself
the
admiral
thought
that
this
lawyer
would
be
just
the
man
to
recommend
the
proper
sort
of
people
to
be
invited
to
the
wedding
of
charles
and
flora
so
he
wrote
to
him
inviting
himself
to
dinner
and
received
back
a
very
gracious
reply
from
the
lawyer
who
declared
that
the
honour
of
entertaining
a
gentleman
whom
he
so
much
respected
as
admiral
bell
was
greater
than
he
had
a
right
to
expect
by
a
great
deal
and
that
he
should
feel
most
grateful
for
his
company
and
await
his
coming
with
the
greatest
impatience
a
devilish
civil
fellow
that
attorney
said
the
admiral
as
he
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
almost
enough
to
put
one
in
conceit
of
lawyers
yes
said
jack
pringle
who
had
overheard
the
admiral
read
the
letter
yes
we
will
honour
him
and
i
only
hope
he
will
have
plenty
of
grog
because
you
see
if
he
don't--d--n
it
what's
that
can't
you
keep
things
to
yourself
this
latter
exclamation
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
admiral
was
so
indignant
at
jack
for
listening
to
what
he
had
been
saying
as
to
throw
a
leaden
inkstand
that
happened
to
be
upon
the
table
at
his
head
you
mutinous
swab
he
said
cannot
a
gentleman
ask
me
to
dinner
or
cannot
i
ask
myself
without
you
putting
your
spoke
in
the
windlass
you
vagabond
oh
well
said
jack
if
you
are
out
of
temper
about
it
i
had
better
send
my
mark
to
the
lawyer
and
tell
him
that
we
won't
come
as
it
has
made
some
family
differences
family
you
thief
said
the
admiral
what
do
you
mean
what
family
do
you
think
would
own
you
d--n
me
if
i
don't
think
you
came
over
in
some
strange
ship
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
if
you
interfere
in
this
matter
i'll
be
hanged
if
i
don't
blow
your
brains
out
and
you'll
be
hanged
if
you
do
said
jack
as
he
walked
out
of
the
room
so
it's
all
one
either
way
old
fizgig
what
roared
the
admiral
as
he
sprang
up
and
ran
after
jack
have
i
lived
all
these
years
to
be
called
names
in
my
own
ship--i
mean
my
own
house
what
does
the
infernal
rascal
mean
by
it
the
admiral
no
doubt
would
have
pursued
jack
very
closely
had
not
flora
intercepted
him
and
by
gentle
violence
got
him
back
to
the
room
no
one
else
could
have
ventured
to
have
stopped
him
but
the
affection
he
had
for
her
was
so
great
that
she
could
really
accomplish
almost
anything
with
him
and
by
listening
quietly
to
his
complaints
of
jack
pringle--which
however
involved
a
disclosure
of
the
fact
which
he
had
intended
to
keep
to
himself
that
he
had
sought
the
lawyer's
advice--she
succeeded
in
soothing
him
completely
so
that
he
forgot
his
anger
in
a
very
short
time
but
the
old
man's
anger
although
easily
aroused
never
lasted
very
long
and
upon
the
whole
it
was
really
astonishing
what
he
put
up
with
from
jack
pringle
in
the
way
of
taunts
and
sneers
of
all
sorts
and
descriptions
and
now
and
then
not
a
little
real
abuse
and
probably
he
thought
likewise
that
jack
pringle
did
not
mean
what
he
said
on
the
same
principle
that
he
the
admiral
when
he
called
jack
a
mutinous
swab
and
a
marine
certainly
did
not
mean
that
jack
was
those
things
but
merely
used
them
as
expletives
to
express
a
great
amount
of
indignation
at
the
moment
because
as
may
be
well
supposed
nothing
in
the
world
could
be
worse
in
admiral
bell's
estimation
that
to
be
a
mutinous
swab
or
a
marine
it
was
rather
a
wonder
though
that
in
his
anger
some
day
he
did
not
do
jack
some
mischief
for
as
we
have
had
occasion
to
notice
in
one
or
two
cases
the
admiral
was
not
extremely
particular
as
to
what
sorts
of
missiles
he
used
when
he
considered
it
necessary
to
throw
something
at
jack's
head
it
would
not
have
been
a
surprising
thing
if
jack
had
really
made
some
communication
to
the
lawyer
but
he
did
stop
short
at
that
amount
of
pleasantry
and
as
he
himself
expressed
it
for
once
in
a
way
he
let
the
old
man
please
himself
the
admiral
soon
forgot
this
little
dispute
and
then
pleased
himself
with
the
idea
that
he
should
pass
a
pleasant
day
with
the
attorney
ah
well
he
said
who
would
have
thought
that
ever
i
should
have
gone
and
taken
dinner
with
a
lawyer--and
not
only
done
that
but
invited
myself
too
it
shows
us
all
that
there
may
be
some
good
in
all
sorts
of
men
lawyers
included
and
i
am
sure
after
this
i
ought
to
begin
to
think
what
i
never
thought
before
and
that
is
that
a
marine
may
actually
be
a
useful
person
it
shows
that
as
one
gets
older
one
gets
wiser
illustration
it
was
an
immense
piece
of
liberality
for
a
man
brought
up
as
admiral
bell
had
been
in
decidedly
one
of
the
most
prejudiced
branches
of
the
public
service
to
make
any
such
admissions
as
these
a
very
great
thing
it
was
and
showed
a
liberality
of
mind
such
as
even
at
the
present
time
is
not
readily
found
it
is
astonishing
as
well
as
amusing
to
find
how
the
mind
assimilates
itself
to
the
circumstances
in
which
it
is
placed
and
how
society
being
cut
up
into
small
sections
imagines
different
things
merely
as
a
consequence
of
their
peculiar
application
we
shall
find
that
even
people
living
at
different
ends
of
a
city
will
look
with
a
sort
of
pity
and
contempt
upon
each
other
and
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
public
writers
are
found
who
use
what
little
ability
they
may
possess
in
pandering
to
their
feelings
it
was
as
contemptible
and
silly
as
it
was
reprehensible
for
a
late
celebrated
novelist
to
pretend
that
he
believed
there
was
at
place
called
bloomsbury-square
but
he
really
did
not
know
because
that
was
merely
done
for
the
purpose
of
raising
a
silly
laugh
among
persons
who
were
neither
respectable
on
account
of
their
abilities
or
their
conduct
but
to
return
from
this
digression
the
admiral
attired
in
his
best
suit
which
always
consisted
of
a
blue
coat
the
exact
colour
of
the
navy
uniform
an
immense
pale
primrose
coloured
waistcoat
and
white
kerseymere
continuations
went
to
the
lawyer's
as
had
been
arranged
if
anything
at
all
could
flatter
the
old
man's
vanity
successfully
it
certainly
would
be
the
manner
in
which
he
was
received
at
the
lawyer's
house
where
everything
was
done
that
could
give
him
satisfaction
a
very
handsome
repast
was
laid
before
him
and
when
the
cloth
was
removed
the
admiral
broached
the
subject
upon
which
he
wished
to
ask
the
advice
of
his
professional
friend
after
telling
him
of
the
wedding
that
was
to
come
off
he
said--
now
i
have
bargained
to
invite
twenty
people
and
of
course
as
that
is
exclusive
of
any
of
the
family
and
as
i
don't
know
any
people
about
this
neighbourhood
except
yourself
i
want
you
and
your
family
to
come
to
start
with
and
then
i
want
you
to
find
me
out
some
more
decent
people
to
make
up
the
party
i
feel
highly
flattered
said
the
attorney
that
in
such
a
case
as
this
you
should
have
come
to
me
and
my
only
great
fear
is
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
give
you
satisfaction
oh
you
needn't
be
afraid
of
that
there
is
no
fear
on
that
head
so
i
shall
leave
it
all
to
you
to
invite
the
folks
that
you
think
proper
i
will
endeavour
certainly
admiral
to
do
my
best
of
course
living
in
the
town
as
i
have
for
many
years
i
know
some
very
nice
people
as
well
as
some
very
queer
ones
oh
we
don't
want
any
of
the
queer
ones
but
let
those
who
are
invited
be
frank
hearty
good-tempered
people
such
as
one
will
be
glad
to
meet
over
and
over
again
without
any
ceremony--none
of
your
simpering
people
who
are
afraid
to
laugh
for
fear
of
opening
their
mouths
too
wide
but
who
are
so
mighty
genteel
that
they
are
afraid
to
enjoy
anything
for
fear
it
should
be
vulgar
i
understand
you
admiral
perfectly
and
shall
endeavour
to
obey
your
instructions
to
the
very
letter
but
if
i
should
unfortunately
invite
anybody
you
don't
like
you
must
excuse
me
for
making
such
a
mistake
oh
of
course--of
course
never
mind
that
and
if
any
disagreeable
fellow
comes
we
will
smother
him
in
some
way
it
would
serve
him
right
for
no
one
ought
to
make
himself
disagreeable
after
being
honoured
with
an
invitation
from
you
but
i
will
be
most
especially
careful
and
i
hope
that
such
a
circumstance
will
not
occur
never
mind
if
it
should
i'll
tell
you
what
i'll
do
i'll
set
jack
pringle
upon
him
and
if
he
don't
worry
his
life
out
it
will
be
a
strange
thing
to
me
oh
said
the
lawyer
i
am
glad
you
have
mentioned
him
for
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
of
saying
that
i
have
done
all
in
my
power
to
make
him
comfortable
all
in
your
power
to
make
him
comfortable
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
have
placed
such
a
dinner
before
him
as
will
please
him
i
told
him
to
ask
for
just
whatever
he
likes
the
admiral
looked
at
the
lawyer
with
amazement
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
and
then
he
said
d--n
it
why
you
don't
mean
to
tell
me
that
that
rascal
is
here
oh
yes
he
came
about
ten
minutes
i
before
you
arrived
and
said
you
were
coming
and
he
has
been
down
stairs
feasting
all
the
while
since
stop
a
bit
do
you
happen
to
have
any
loaded
fire
arms
in
the
house
we
have
got
an
old
bunderbuss
but
what
for
admiral
to
shoot
that
scoundrel
pringle
i'll
blow
his
brains
out
as
sure
as
fate
the
impudence
of
his
coming
here
directly
against
my
orders
too
my
dear
sir
calm
yourself
and
think
nothing
of
it
it's
of
no
consequence
whatever
no
consequence
where
is
that
blunderbuss
of
yours
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
mutiny
is
of
no
consequence
give
me
the
blunderbuss
but
my
clear
sir
we
only
keep
it
in
terrorem
and
have
no
bullets
never
mind
that
we
can
cram
in
a
handful
of
nails
or
brass
buttons
or
hammer
up
a
few
halfpence--anything
of
that
sort
will
do
to
settle
his
business
with
how
do
you
get
on
old
tarbarrel
said
jack
putting
his
head
in
at
the
door
are
you
making
yourself
comfortable
i'll
be
hanged
if
i
don't
think
you
have
a
drop
too
much
already
you
look
so
precious
red
about
the
gills
i
have
been
getting
on
famous
and
i
thought
i'd
just
hop
up
for
a
minute
to
make
your
mind
easy
about
me
and
tell
you
so
it
was
quite
evident
that
jack
had
done
justice
to
the
good
cheer
of
the
lawyer
for
he
was
rather
unsteady
and
had
to
hold
by
the
door-post
to
support
himself
while
there
was
such
a
look
of
contentment
upon
his
countenance
as
contrasted
with
the
indignation
that
was
manifest
upon
the
admiral's
face
that
as
the
saying
is
it
would
have
made
a
cat
laugh
to
see
them
be
off
with
ye
jack
said
the
lawyer
be
off
with
ye
go
down
stairs
again
and
enjoy
yourself
don't
you
see
that
the
admiral
is
angry
with
you
oh
he
be
bothered
said
jack
i'll
soon
settle
him
if
he
comes
any
of
his
nonsense
and
mind
mr
lawyer
whatever
you
do
don't
you
give
him
too
much
to
drink
the
lawyer
ran
to
the
door
and
pushed
jack
out
for
he
rightly
enough
suspected
that
the
quietness
of
the
admiral
was
only
that
calm
which
precedes
a
storm
of
more
than
usual
amount
and
magnitude
so
he
was
anxious
to
part
them
at
once
he
then
set
about
appeasing
as
well
as
he
could
the
admiral's
anger
by
attributing
the
perseverance
of
jack
in
following
him
wherever
he
went
to
his
great
affection
for
him
which
combined
with
his
ignorance
might
make
him
often
troublesome
when
he
had
really
no
intention
of
being
so
this
was
certainly
the
best
way
of
appeasing
the
old
man
and
indeed
the
only
way
in
which
it
could
be
done
successfully
and
the
proof
that
it
was
so
consisted
in
the
fact
that
the
admiral
did
consent
at
the
suggestion
of
the
attorney
to
forgive
jack
once
more
for
the
offence
he
had
committed
the
baron
takes
anderbury
house
and
decides
upon
giving
a
grand
entertainment
illustration
it
was
not
considered
anything
extraordinary
that
although
the
baron
stolmuyer
of
saltzburgh
went
out
with
the
mysterious
stranger
who
had
arrived
at
the
anderbury
arms
to
see
him
he
should
return
without
him
for
certainly
he
was
not
bound
to
bring
him
back
by
any
means
whatever
moreover
he
entered
the
inn
so
quietly
and
with
such
an
appearance
of
perfect
composure
that
no
one
could
have
suspected
for
a
moment
that
he
had
been
guilty
really
of
the
terrific
crime
which
had
been
laid
to
his
charge--a
crime
which
few
men
could
have
committed
in
so
entirely
unmoved
and
passionless
a
manner
as
he
had
done
it
but
he
seemed
to
consider
the
taking
of
a
human
life
as
a
thing
not
of
the
remotest
consequence
and
not
to
be
considered
at
all
as
a
matter
which
was
to
put
any
one
out
of
the
way
but
as
a
thing
to
be
done
when
necessity
required
with
all
the
ease
in
the
world
without
arousing
or
awaking
any
of
those
feelings
of
remorse
which
one
would
suppose
ought
to
find
a
place
in
the
heart
of
a
man
who
had
been
guilty
of
such
monstrous
behaviour
he
walked
up
to
his
own
apartment
again
and
retired
to
rest
with
the
same
feeling
apparently
of
calmness
and
the
same
ability
to
taste
of
the
sweets
of
repose
as
had
before
characterized
him
the
stranger's
horse
which
was
a
valuable
and
beautiful
animal
remained
in
the
stable
of
the
inn
and
as
of
course
that
was
considered
a
guarantee
for
his
return
the
landlord
when
he
himself
retired
to
rest
left
one
of
his
establishment
sitting
up
to
let
in
the
man
who
now
lay
so
motionless
and
so
frightful
in
appearance
in
one
of
the
ice-wells
of
the
mysterious
passage
leading
from
the
base
of
the
cliff
to
the
grounds
of
anderbury
house
but
the
night
wore
on
and
the
man
who
had
been
left
to
let
the
stranger
in
after
making
many
efforts
to
keep
himself
awake
dropped
into
sound
repose
which
he
might
just
as
well
have
done
in
the
first
instance
inasmuch
as
although
he
knew
it
not
he
was
engaged
in
the
vain
task
of
waiting
for
the
dead
the
morning
was
fresh
and
beautiful
and
at
a
far
earlier
hour
than
a
person
of
his
quality
was
expected
to
make
his
appearance
the
baron
descended
from
his
chamber
for
somehow
or
other
by
common
consent
it
seems
to
be
agreed
that
great
personages
must
be
late
in
rising
and
equally
late
in
going
to
bed
but
the
baron
was
evidently
not
so
disposed
to
turn
night
into
day
and
the
landlord
congratulated
himself
not
a
little
upon
the
fact
that
he
was
ready
for
his
illustrious
guest
when
he
descended
so
unexpectedly
from
his
chamber
as
he
did
an
ample
breakfast
was
disposed
of
that
is
to
say
it
was
placed
upon
the
table
and
charged
to
the
baron
who
selected
from
it
what
he
pleased
and
when
the
meal
was
over
the
landlord
ventured
to
enter
the
apartment
and
said
to
him
with
all
due
humility--
if
you
please
sir
mr
leek
who
has
the
letting
of
anderbury-on-the-mount
that
is
anderbury
house
as
it
is
usually
called
is
here
sir
and
would
be
happy
to
take
your
orders
as
to
when
you
would
be
pleased
to
look
at
those
premises
i
shall
be
ready
to
go
in
half
a
hour
said
the
baron
and
as
the
distance
is
not
great
i
will
walk
from
here
to
the
mansion
this
message
was
duly
communicated
to
mr
leek
who
thereupon
determined
upon
waiting
until
the
baron
should
announce
his
readiness
to
depart
upon
the
expedition
and
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
for
in
about
half-an-hour
afterwards
he
descended
to
the
hall
and
then
mr
leek
was
summoned
who
came
out
of
the
bar
with
such
a
grand
rush
that
he
fell
over
a
mat
that
was
before
him
and
saluted
the
baron
by
digging
his
head
into
his
stomach
and
then
falling
sprawling
at
his
feet
and
laying
hold
of
his
ankle
this
little
incident
was
duly
apologised
for
and
explained
after
which
mr
leek
walked
on
through
the
town
towards
anderbury-on-the-mount
followed
by
the
illustrious
personage
whom
he
sincerely
hoped
he
should
be
able
to
induce
to
take
it
it
was
a
curious
thing
to
see
how
they
traversed
the
streets
together
for
while
the
baron
walked
right
on
and
with
a
solemn
and
measured
step
mr
leek
managed
to
get
along
a
few
paces
in
front
of
him
sideways
so
that
he
could
keep
up
a
sort
of
conversation
upon
the
merits
of
anderbury
house
and
the
neighbourhood
in
general
without
much
effort
to
which
remarks
the
baron
made
such
suitable
and
dignified
replies
as
a
baron
would
be
supposed
to
make
you
will
find
sir
said
mr
leek
that
everything
about
anderbury
is
extremely
select
and
amazingly
correct
and
i
am
sure
a
more
delightful
place
to
live
in
could
not
be
found
ah
said
the
baron
very
likely
it's
lively
too
continued
mr
leek
very
lively
and
there
are
two
chapels
of
ease
besides
the
church
that's
a
drawback
said
the
baron
a
drawback
sir
well
i
am
sorry
i
mentioned
it
but
perhaps
you
are
a
roman
catholic
sir
and
in
that
case
the
chapels
of
ease
have
no
interest
for
you
not
the
slightest
but
do
not
sir
run
away
with
any
assumption
concerning
my
religious
opinions
for
i
am
not
a
roman
catholic
no
sir
no
sir
nor
more
am
i
and
as
far
as
i
think
and
my
opinion
goes
i
say
why
shouldn't
a
gentleman
with
a
large
fortune
be
what
he
likes
or
nothing
if
he
likes
that
better
but
here
we
are
sir
close
to
one
of
the
entrances
of
anderbury
house
there
are
three
principal
entrances
you
understand
sir
on
three
sides
of
the
estate
and
the
fourth
side
faces
the
sea
where
there
is
that
mysterious
passage
that
leads
down
from
the
grounds
to
the
beach
which
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
sir
the
landlord
of
the
inn
mentioned
it
we
consider
it
a
great
curiosity
sir
i
can
assure
you
in
these
parts--a
very
great
curiosity
and
it's
an
immense
advantage
to
the
house
because
you
see
sir
in
extremely
hot
weather
all
sorts
of
provisions
can
be
taken
down
there
and
kept
at
such
a
very
low
temperature
as
to
be
quite
delightful
that
is
an
advantage
mr
leek
rang
the
bell
that
hung
over
one
of
the
entrances
and
his
summons
for
admission
was
speedily
answered
by
the
old
couple
who
had
charge
of
the
premises
and
then
with
a
view
of
impressing
them
with
a
notion
of
the
importance
of
the
personage
whom
he
had
brought
to
look
at
the
place
he
said
aloud--
the
baron
stoltmayor
of
saltsomething
has
come
to
look
at
the
premises
this
announcement
was
received
with
all
due
deference
and
respect
and
the
task
of
showing
the
baron
the
premises
at
once
fairly
commenced
here
you
have
said
mr
leek
assuming
an
oratorical
attitude--here
you
have
the
umbrageous
trees
stooping
down
to
dip
their
leaves
in
the
purling
waters
here
you
have
the
sweet
foliage
lending
a
delicious
perfume
to
the
balmy
air
here
you
have
the
murmuring
waterfalls
playing
music
of
the
spheres
to
the
listening
birds
who
sit
responsive
upon
the
dancing
boughs
here
you
have
all
the
fragrance
of
the
briny
ocean
mingling
with
the
scent
of
a
bank
of
violets
and
wrapping
the
senses
in
elysium
here
you
may
never
tire
of
an
existence
that
presents
never-ending
charms
and
that
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
which
you
may
live
far
beyond
the
allotted
span
of
man
enough--enough
said
the
baron
here
you
have
the
choicest
exotics
taking
kindly
to
a
soil
gifted
by
nature
with
the
most
extraordinary
powers
of
production
and
all
that
can
pamper
the
appetite
or
yield
delight
to
the
senses
is
scattered
around
by
nature
with
a
liberal
hand
it
is
quite
impossible
that
royalty
should
come
near
the
favoured
spot
without
visiting
it
as
a
thing
of
course
and
i
forgot
to
mention
that
a
revenue
is
derived
from
some
cottages
which
although
small
is
yet
sufficient
to
pay
the
tithe
on
the
whole
estate
there
there--that
will
do
here
you
have
purling
rills
and
cascades
and
fish-ponds
so
redundant
with
the
finny
tribe
that
you
have
but
to
wish
for
sport
and
it
is
yours
here
you
have
in
the
mansion
chambers
that
vie
with
the
accommodation
of
a
palace--ample
dormitories
and
halls
of
ancient
grandeur
here
you
have--
stop
said
the
baron
stop
i
cannot
be
pestered
in
this
way
with
your
description
i
have
no
patience
to
listen
to
such
mere
words--show
me
the
house
at
once
and
let
me
judge
for
myself
certainly
sir
oh
certainly
only
i
thought
it
right
to
give
you
a
slight
description
of
the
place
as
it
really
was
and
now
sir
that
we
have
reached
the
house
i
may
remark
that
here
we
have--
silence
said
the
baron
if
you
begin
with
here
we
have
i
know
not
when
you
will
leave
off
all
i
require
of
you
is
to
show
me
the
place
and
to
answer
any
question
which
i
may
put
to
you
concerning
it
i
will
draw
my
own
conclusions
and
nothing
you
can
say
one
way
or
another
will
affect
my
imagination
certainly
sir
certainly
i
shall
only
be
too
happy
to
answer
any
questions
that
may
be
put
to
me
by
a
person
of
your
lordship's
great
intelligence
and
all
i
can
remark
is
that
when
you
reach
the
drawing-room
floor
any
person
may
truly
say
here
you
have--i
really
beg
your
pardon
sir--i
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
saying
here
you
have
i
assure
you
but
the
words
came
out
quite
unawares
i
assure
you
peace--peace
cried
again
the
baron
you
disturb
me
by
this
incessant
clatter
thus
admonished
mr
leek
was
now
quiet
and
allowed
the
baron
in
his
own
way
to
make
what
investigation
he
pleased
concerning
anderbury
house
the
investigation
was
not
one
that
could
be
gone
over
in
ten
minutes
for
the
house
was
extremely
extensive
and
the
estate
altogether
presented
so
many
features
of
beauty
and
interest
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
linger
over
it
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
the
grounds
were
most
extensive
and
planted
with
such
a
regard
to
order
and
regularity
everything
being
in
its
proper
place
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
an
estate
so
well
kept
and
although
the
baron
was
not
a
man
who
said
much
it
was
quite
evident
by
what
little
he
did
utter
that
he
was
very
well
pleased
with
anderbury-on-the-mount
and
now
said
mr
leek
i
will
do
myself
the
pleasure
sir
of
showing
your
grace
the
subterranean
passage
at
this
moment
a
loud
ring
at
one
of
the
entrance
gates
was
heard
and
upon
the
man
who
had
charge
of
the
house
answering
the
summons
for
admission
he
found
that
it
was
a
gentleman
who
gave
a
card
on
which
was
the
name
of
sir
john
westlake
and
who
desired
to
see
the
premises
sir
john
westlake
said
mr
leek
oh
i
recollect
he
did
call
at
my
office
and
say
that
he
thought
of
taking
anderbury-on-the-mount
a
gentleman
of
great
and
taste
is
sir
john
but
i
must
tell
him
baron
that
you
have
the
preference
if
you
choose
to
embrace
it
at
this
moment
the
stranger
advanced
and
when
he
saw
the
baron
he
bowed
courteously
upon
which
mr
leek
said--
i
regret
sir
john
that
if
you
should
take
a
fancy
to
the
place
i
am
compelled
first
of
all
to
give
this
gentleman
the
refusal
of
it
certainly
said
sir
john
westlake
do
not
let
me
interfere
with
any
one
i
have
nearly
made
up
my
mind
and
came
to
look
over
the
property
again
but
of
course
if
this
gentleman
is
beforehand
with
me
i
must
be
content
i
wish
particularly
to
go
down
to
the
subterranean
passage
to
the
beach
if
it
is
not
too
much
trouble
trouble
certainly
not
sir
here
davis
get
some
links
and
we
can
go
at
once
and
as
this
gentleman
likewise
has
seen
everything
but
that
strange
excavation
he
will
probably
descend
with
us
certainly
said
the
baron
i
shall
have
great
pleasure
and
he
said
it
with
so
free
and
unembarrassed
an
air
that
no
one
could
have
believed
for
a
moment
in
the
possibility
that
such
a
subject
of
fearful
interest
to
him
was
there
to
be
found
the
entrance
from
the
grounds
into
this
deep
cavernous
place
was
in
a
small
but
neat
building
that
looked
like
a
summer-house
and
now
torches
being
procured
and
one
lit
a
door
was
opened
which
conducted
at
once
into
the
commencement
of
the
excavation
and
mr
leek
heading
the
way
the
distinguished
party
as
that
gentleman
loved
afterwards
to
call
it
in
his
accounts
of
the
transaction
proceeded
into
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
as
it
were
and
quickly
lost
all
traces
of
the
daylight
the
place
did
not
descend
by
steps
but
by
a
gentle
slope
which
it
required
some
caution
to
traverse
because
being
cut
in
the
chalk
which
in
some
places
was
worn
very
smooth
it
was
extremely
slippery
but
this
was
a
difficulty
that
a
little
practice
soon
overcame
and
as
they
went
on
the
place
became
more
interesting
every
minute
even
the
baron
allowed
mr
leek
to
make
a
speech
upon
the
occasion
and
that
gentleman
said--
you
will
perceive
that
this
excavation
must
have
been
made
at
a
great
expense
out
of
the
solid
cliff
and
in
making
it
some
of
the
most
curious
specimens
of
petrifaction
and
fossil
remains
were
found
you
see
that
the
roof
is
vaulted
and
that
it
is
only
now
and
then
a
lump
of
chalk
has
fallen
in
or
a
great
piece
of
flint
and
now
we
come
to
one
of
the
ice-wells
they
came
to
a
deep
excavation
down
which
they
looked
and
when
the
man
held
the
torch
beneath
its
surface
they
could
dimly
see
the
bottom
of
it
where
there
was
a
number
of
large
pieces
of
flint
stone
and
apparently
likewise
the
remains
of
broken
bottles
there
used
to
be
a
windlass
at
the
top
of
this
said
mr
leek
and
the
things
were
let
down
in
a
basket
they
do
say
that
ice
will
keep
for
two
years
in
one
of
these
places
and
are
there
more
of
these
excavations
said
the
baron
oh
dear
yes
sir
there
are
five
or
six
of
them
for
different
purposes
for
when
the
family
that
used
to
live
in
anderbury
house
had
grand
entertainments
which
they
sometimes
had
in
the
summer
season
they
always
had
a
lot
of
men
down
here
cooling
wines
and
passing
them
up
from
hand
to
hand
to
the
house
from
the
gradual
slope
of
this
passage
down
to
the
cliffs
and
the
zigzag
character
of
it
it
may
be
well
supposed
that
it
was
of
considerable
extent
indeed
mr
leek
asserted
that
it
was
half
a
mile
in
actual
measured
length
the
baron
was
not
at
all
anxious
to
run
any
risk
of
a
discovery
of
the
dead
body
which
he
had
cast
into
that
ice-well
which
was
nearest
to
the
opening
on
to
the
beach
so
as
he
went
on
he
negatived
the
different
proposals
that
were
made
to
look
down
into
the
excavations
and
succeeded
in
putting
a
stop
to
that
species
of
inquiry
in
the
majority
of
instances
but
he
could
not
wholly
do
so
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
his
purpose
if
he
had
encouraged
a
look
into
every
one
of
the
ice-wells
for
in
that
case
their
similarity
of
appearance
might
have
tired
out
sir
john
westlake
before
they
got
to
the
last
one
but
as
it
was
when
they
reached
the
one
down
which
the
body
had
been
precipitated
he
had
the
mortification
to
hear
mr
leek
say--
and
now
sir
john
and
you
my
lord
baron
as
we
have
looked
at
the
first
of
these
ice
wells
and
at
none
of
the
others
suppose
we
look
at
the
last
the
baron
was
afraid
to
say
anything
because
if
the
body
were
discovered
and
identified
as
that
of
the
visitor
at
the
inn
and
who
had
been
seen
last
with
him
any
reluctance
on
his
part
to
have
that
ice-well
examined
might
easily
afterwards
be
construed
into
a
very
powerful
piece
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
him
he
therefore
merely
bowed
his
assent
thinking
that
the
examination
would
be
but
a
superficial
one
and
that
in
consequence
he
should
escape
easily
from
any
disagreeable
consequences
but
this
the
fates
ordained
otherwise
and
there
seemed
no
hope
of
that
ice-well
in
particular
escaping
such
an
investigation
as
was
sure
to
induce
some
uncomfortable
results
davis
said
mr
leek
these
places
are
not
deep
you
see
and
i
was
thinking
that
if
you
went
down
one
of
them
it
would
be
as
well
for
then
you
would
be
able
to
tell
the
gentlemen
what
the
bottom
was
fairly
composed
of
you
understand
oh
i
don't
mind
sir
said
davis
i
have
been
down
one
of
them
before
to-day
i
can
tell
you
sir
i
do
not
see
the
necessity
said
sir
john
westlake
exactly
of
such
a
thing
but
still
if
you
please
and
this
gentleman
wishes--
i
have
no
wish
upon
the
occasion
said
the
baron
and
like
yourself
cannot
see
the
necessity
oh
there
is
no
trouble
said
mr
leek
and
it's
better
now
you
are
here
that
you
see
and
understand
all
about
it
how
can
you
get
down
davis
why
sir
it
ain't
above
fourteen
feet
altogether
so
i
sha'n't
have
any
difficulty
for
i
can
hang
by
my
hands
about
half
the
distance
and
drop
the
remainder
as
he
spoke
he
took
off
his
coat
and
then
stuck
the
link
he
carried
into
a
cleft
of
the
rock
that
was
beside
the
brink
of
the
excavation
the
baron
now
saw
that
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
avoiding
a
discovery
of
the
fact
of
the
dead
body
being
in
that
place
and
his
only
hope
was
that
in
its
descent
it
might
have
become
so
injured
as
to
defy
identification
but
this
was
a
faint
hope
because
he
recollected
that
he
had
himself
seen
the
face
which
was
turned
upwards
and
the
period
after
death
was
by
far
too
short
for
him
to
have
any
hope
that
decomposition
could
have
taken
place
even
to
the
most
limited
extent
the
light
which
was
stuck
in
a
niche
shed
but
a
few
inefficient
rays
down
into
the
pit
and
as
the
baron
stood
with
folded
arms
looking
calmly
on
he
expected
each
moment
a
scene
of
surprise
and
terror
would
ensue
nor
was
he
wrong
for
scarcely
had
the
man
plunged
down
into
that
deep
place
than
he
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
and
terror
and
shouted--
murder
murder
lift
me
out
there
is
a
dead
man
down
here
and
i
have
jumped
upon
him
a
dead
man
cried
mr
leek
and
sir
john
westlake
in
a
breath
how
very
strange
said
the
baron
lend
me
a
hand
cried
davis
lend
me
a
hand
out
i
cannot
stand
this
you
know
lend
me
a
hand
out
i
say
at
once
this
was
easier
to
speak
of
than
to
do
and
mr
davis
began
to
discover
that
it
was
easier
by
far
to
get
into
a
deep
pit
than
to
get
out
of
one
notwithstanding
that
his
assertion
of
having
been
down
into
those
places
was
perfectly
true
but
then
he
had
met
with
nothing
alarming
and
had
been
able
perfectly
at
his
leisure
to
scramble
out
the
best
way
he
could
now
however
his
frantic
efforts
to
release
himself
from
a
much
more
uncomfortable
situation
than
he
had
imagined
it
possible
for
him
to
get
into
were
of
so
frantic
a
nature
that
he
only
half
buried
himself
in
pieces
of
chalk
which
he
kept
pulling
down
with
vehemence
from
the
sides
of
the
pit
and
succeeded
in
accomplishing
nothing
towards
his
rescue
oh
the
fellow
is
only
joking
said
the
baron
and
amusing
himself
at
our
expense
but
the
manner
in
which
the
man
cried
for
help
and
the
marked
terror
which
was
in
every
tone
was
quite
sufficient
to
prove
that
he
was
not
acting
for
if
he
were
a
more
accomplished
mimic
could
not
have
been
found
on
the
stage
than
he
was
this
is
serious
said
sir
john
westlake
and
cannot
be
allowed
have
you
any
ropes
here
by
which
we
can
assist
him
from
the
pit
don't
be
alarmed
my
man
for
if
there
be
a
dead
body
in
the
pit
it
can't
harm
you
take
your
time
quietly
and
easily
and
you
will
assuredly
get
out
aye
said
the
baron
the
more
haste
the
worst
speed
is
an
english
proverb
and
in
this
case
it
will
be
fully
exemplified
this
man
would
easily
leave
the
pit
if
he
would
have
the
patience
with
care
and
quietness
to
clamber
up
its
sides
it
would
appear
that
davis
felt
the
truth
of
these
exhortations
for
although
he
trembled
excessively
he
did
begin
to
make
some
progress
in
his
ascent
and
get
so
high
that
mr
leek
was
enabled
to
get
hold
of
his
hand
and
give
him
a
little
assistance
so
that
in
another
minute
or
so
he
was
rescued
from
his
situation
which
was
not
one
of
peril
although
it
was
certainly
one
of
fright
he
trembled
so
excessively
and
stuttered
and
stammered
that
for
some
minutes
no
one
could
understand
very
well
what
he
said
but
at
length
upon
making
himself
intelligible
he
exclaimed--
there
has
been
a
murder
there
has
been
a
murder
committed
and
the
body
thrown
into
the
ice
pit
i
felt
that
i
jumped
down
upon
something
soft
and
when
i
put
down
my
hand
to
feel
what
it
was
it
came
across
a
dead
man's
face
and
then
of
course
i
called
out
you
certainly
did
call
out
yes
and
so
would
anybody
i
think
under
such
circumstances
i
suppose
i
shall
be
hung
now
because
i
had
charge
of
the
house
that
did
not
strike
me
until
this
moment
said
the
baron
but
if
there
be
a
dead
body
in
that
pit
it
certainly
places
this
man
in
a
very
awkward
position
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
said
davis
i
don't
know
no
more
about
it
than
the
child
unborn
there
is
a
dead
man
in
the
ice-well
and
that
is
all
i
know
about
it
but
whether
he
has
been
there
a
long
time
or
a
short
time
i
don't
know
any
more
than
the
moon
so
it's
no
use
bothering
me
about
it
my
good
man
said
the
baron
it
would
be
very
wrong
indeed
to
impute
to
you
any
amount
of
criminality
in
this
business
since
you
may
be
entirely
innocent
and
i
for
one
believe
that
you
are
so
for
i
cannot
think
that
any
guilty
man
would
venture
into
the
place
where
he
had
put
the
body
of
his
victim
in
the
way
that
you
ventured
into
that
pit
i
say
i
cannot
believe
it
possible
and
therefore
i
think
you
innocent
and
will
take
care
to
see
that
no
injustice
is
done
you
but
at
the
same
time
i
cannot
help
adding
that
i
think
of
course
you
will
find
yourself
suspected
in
some
way
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
sir
said
davis
but
as
i
happen
to
be
quite
innocent
i
am
very
easy
about
it
and
don't
care
one
straw
what
people
say
i
have
not
been
in
this
excavation
for
heaven
knows
how
long
but
what's
to
be
done
said
mr
leek
i
suppose
it's
our
duty
to
do
something
under
such
circumstances
unquestionably
said
the
baron
and
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
inform
the
police
of
what
has
happened
so
that
the
body
may
be
got
up
and
as
i
have
now
seen
enough
of
the
estate
to
satisfy
me
as
regards
its
capabilities
i
decide
at
once
upon
taking
it
if
i
can
agree
upon
the
conditions
of
the
tenancy
and
i
will
purchase
it
if
the
price
be
such
as
i
think
suitable
well
said
mr
leek
if
anything
could
reconcile
me
to
the
extraordinary
circumstance
that
has
just
occurred
it
certainly
is
baron
the
having
so
desirable
a
tenant
for
anderbury-on-the-mount
as
yourself
but
we
need
not
traverse
all
this
passage
again
for
it
is
much
nearer
now
to
get
out
upon
the
sea-coast
at
once
as
we
are
so
close
to
the
other
opening
upon
the
beach
it
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
town
and
give
information
to
the
authorities
of
the
discovery
which
we
have
made
it
is
absolutely
necessary
said
the
baron
so
to
do
so
come
along
at
once
i
shall
proceed
to
my
inn
and
as
of
course
i
have
seen
nothing
more
than
yourselves
and
consequently
could
only
repeat
your
evidence
i
do
not
see
that
my
presence
is
called
for
nevertheless
of
course
if
the
justices
think
it
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
appear
i
can
have
no
possible
objection
to
so
do
this
was
as
straightforward
as
anything
that
could
be
desired
and
moreover
it
was
rather
artfully
put
together
for
it
seemed
to
imply
that
he
mr
leek
would
be
slighted
if
his
evidence
was
not
considered
sufficient
of
course
said
mr
leek
i
don't
see
at
all
why
as
you
sir
have
only
the
same
thing
to
say
as
myself
i
should
not
be
sufficient
don't
call
upon
me
on
any
account
said
sir
john
westlake
oh
no
no
cried
mr
leek
there
is
no
occasion
i
won't
you
may
depend
if
it
can
be
helped
sir
john
in
rather
a
nervous
and
excited
manner
bade
them
good
day
before
they
got
quite
into
the
town
and
hurried
off
while
the
baron
with
a
dignified
bow
when
he
reached
the
door
of
his
hotel
said
to
mr
leek--
of
course
i
do
not
like
the
trouble
of
judicial
investigations
more
than
anybody
else
and
therefore
unless
it
is
imperatively
necessary
that
i
should
appear
i
shall
take
it
as
a
favour
to
be
released
from
such
a
trouble
my
lord
baron
said
mr
leek
you
may
depend
that
i
shall
mention
that
to
the
magistrates
and
the
coroner
and
all
those
sort
of
people
and
then
mr
leek
walked
away
but
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
did
so
they
will
have
him
as
sure
as
fate
just
because
he
is
a
baron
and
his
name
will
look
well
in
the
'county
chronicle'
mr
leek
then
repaired
immediately
to
the
house
of
one
of
the
principal
magistrates
and
related
what
had
occurred
to
the
great
surprise
of
that
gentleman
who
suggested
immediately
the
propriety
of
making
the
fact
known
to
the
coroner
of
the
district
as
it
was
more
his
business
than
a
magistrate's
in
the
first
instance
since
nobody
was
accused
of
the
offence
this
suggestion
was
immediately
followed
and
that
functionary
directed
that
the
body
should
be
removed
from
where
it
was
to
the
nearest
public-house
and
immediately
issued
his
precept
for
an
inquiry
into
the
case
by
this
time
the
matter
had
begun
to
get
bruited
about
in
the
town
and
of
course
it
went
from
mouth
to
mouth
with
many
exaggerations
and
although
it
by
no
means
did
follow
that
a
murder
had
been
committed
because
a
dead
body
had
been
found
yet
such
was
the
universal
impression
and
the
matter
began
to
be
talked
about
as
the
murder
in
the
subterranean
passage
leading
to
anderbury
house
with
all
the
gusto
which
the
full
particulars
of
some
deed
of
blood
was
calculated
to
inspire
and
how
it
spread
about
was
thus--
the
fact
was
that
mr
leek
was
so
anxious
to
let
anderbury-on-the-mount
to
the
rich
baron
stolmuyer
of
saltzburgh
that
he
got
a
friend
of
his
to
come
and
personate
sir
john
westlake
while
he
the
baron
was
looking
at
the
premises
in
order
to
drive
him
at
once
to
a
conclusion
upon
the
matter
so
that
what
made
sir
john
so
very
anxious
that
he
should
not
be
called
forward
in
the
matter
consisted
in
the
simple
fact
that
he
was
nothing
else
than
plain
mr
brown
who
kept
a
hatter's
shop
in
the
town
but
he
could
not
keep
his
own
counsel
and
instead
of
holding
his
tongue
as
he
ought
to
have
done
about
the
matter
he
told
it
to
every
one
he
met
so
that
in
a
short
time
it
was
generally
known
that
something
serious
and
startling
had
occurred
in
the
subterranean
passage
to
anderbury
house
and
a
great
mob
of
persons
thronged
the
beach
in
anxious
expectation
of
getting
more
information
on
the
matter
the
men
likewise
who
had
been
ordered
by
the
coroner
to
remove
the
body
soon
reached
the
spot
and
they
gave
an
increased
impetus
to
the
proceedings
by
opening
the
door
of
the
subterranean
passage
and
then
looking
earnestly
along
the
beach
as
if
in
expectation
of
something
or
somebody
of
importance
when
eagerly
questioned
by
the
mob
for
the
throng
of
persons
now
assembled
quite
amounted
to
a
mob
to
know
what
they
waited
for
one
of
them
said--
a
coffin
was
to
have
been
brought
down
to
take
the
body
in
this
announcement
at
once
removed
anything
doubtful
that
might
be
in
the
minds
of
any
of
them
upon
the
subject
and
at
once
proclaimed
the
fact
not
only
that
there
was
a
dead
body
but
that
if
they
looked
out
they
would
see
it
forthwith
the
throng
thickened
and
by
the
time
two
men
were
observed
approaching
with
a
coffin
on
their
shoulders
there
was
scarcely
anybody
left
in
the
town
except
a
few
rare
persons
indeed
who
were
not
so
curious
as
their
neighbours
it
was
not
an
agreeable
job
even
to
those
men
who
were
not
the
most
particular
in
the
world
to
be
removing
so
loathsome
a
spectacle
as
that
which
they
were
pretty
sure
to
encounter
in
the
ice-well
but
they
did
not
shrink
from
it
and
by
setting
about
it
as
a
duty
they
got
through
it
tolerably
well
they
took
with
them
several
large
torches
and
then
one
having
descended
into
the
pit
fastened
a
rope
under
the
arms
of
the
dead
man
and
so
he
was
hauled
out
and
placed
in
the
shell
that
was
ready
to
receive
him
they
were
all
surprised
at
the
fresh
and
almost
healthful
appearance
of
the
countenance
and
it
was
quite
evident
to
everybody
that
if
any
one
had
known
him
in
life
they
could
not
have
the
least
possible
difficulty
in
recognising
him
now
that
he
was
no
more
and
the
only
appearance
of
injury
which
he
exhibited
was
in
that
dreadful
wound
which
had
certainly
proved
his
death
and
which
was
observable
in
his
throat
the
moment
they
looked
upon
him
illustration
the
crush
to
obtain
a
sight
of
the
body
was
tremendous
at
the
moment
it
was
brought
out
and
a
vast
concourse
of
persons
followed
it
in
procession
to
the
town
where
the
greatest
excitement
prevailed
it
was
easily
discovered
that
no
known
person
was
missing
and
some
who
had
caught
a
sight
of
the
body
went
so
far
as
to
assert
that
it
must
have
been
in
the
ice-well
for
years
and
that
the
extreme
cold
had
preserved
it
in
all
its
original
freshness
the
news
of
course
came
round
although
not
through
the
baron
for
he
did
not
condescend
to
say
one
word
about
it
at
the
inn
and
it
was
the
landlord
who
first
started
the
suggestion
of--what
suppose
it
is
the
gentleman
who
left
his
horse
here
this
idea
had
no
sooner
got
possession
of
his
brain
than
it
each
moment
seemed
to
him
to
assume
a
more
reasonable
and
tangible
form
and
without
saying
any
more
to
any
one
else
about
it
he
at
once
started
off
to
where
the
body
lay
awaiting
an
inquest
to
see
if
his
suspicions
were
correct
when
he
arrived
at
the
public-house
and
asked
to
see
the
body
he
was
at
once
permitted
to
do
so
for
the
landlord
knew
him
and
was
as
curious
as
he
could
be
upon
the
subject
by
any
possibility
one
glance
of
course
was
sufficient
and
the
landlord
at
once
said--
yes
i
have
seen
him
before
though
i
don't
know
his
name
he
came
to
my
house
last
night
and
left
his
horse
there
and
although
i
only
saw
him
for
a
moment
as
he
passed
through
the
hall
i
am
certain
i
am
not
mistaken
i
dare
say
all
my
waiters
will
recognise
him
as
well
as
the
baron
stolmuyer
of
saltzburgh
who
is
staying
with
me
and
who
no
doubt
knows
very
well
who
he
is
for
he
went
out
with
him
late
and
came
home
alone
and
i
ordered
one
of
my
men
to
wait
up
all
night
in
order
to
let
in
this
very
person
who
is
now
lying
dead
before
us
the
deuce
you
did
but
you
don't
suppose
the
baron
murdered
him
do
you
it's
a
mystery
to
me
altogether--quite
a
profound
mystery
it's
very
unlikely
certainly
and
what's
the
most
extraordinary
part
of
the
whole
affair
is
how
the
deuce
could
he
come
into
one
of
the
ice-wells
belonging
to
anderbury
house
that's
what
puzzles
me
altogether
well
it
will
all
come
out
i
hope
at
the
inquest
which
is
to
be
held
at
four
o'clock
to
day
there
must
have
been
foul
play
somewhere
but
the
mystery
is
where
and
that
heaven
only
knows
perhaps
i
shall
attend
said
the
landlord
of
course
to
identify
him
and
i
suppose
unless
anybody
claims
the
horse
i
may
as
well
keep
possession
of
it
don't
you
flatter
yourself
that
you
will
get
the
horse
out
of
the
transaction
don't
you
know
quite
well
that
the
government
takes
possession
of
everything
as
don't
belong
to
nobody
yes
but
i
have
got
him
and
possession
you
know
is
nine
points
of
the
law
it
may
be
so
but
their
tenth
point
will
get
the
better
of
you
for
all
that
you
take
my
word
for
it
the
horse
will
be
claimed
of
you
but
i
don't
mind
as
an
old
acquaintance
putting
you
up
to
a
dodge
in
what
way
why
i'll
tell
you
what
happened
with
a
friend
of
mine
but
don't
think
it
was
me
for
if
it
was
i
would
tell
you
at
once
so
don't
think
it
he
kept
a
country
public-house
and
one
day
an
elderly
gentleman
came
in
and
appeared
to
be
unwell
he
just
uttered
a
word
or
two
and
then
dropped
down
dead
he
happened
to
have
in
his
fob
a
gold
repeater
that
was
worth
at
least
a
hundred
guineas
and
my
friend
before
anybody
came
took
it
out
and
popped
in
in
its
stead
an
old
watch
that
he
had
which
was
not
worth
a
couple
of
pounds
it
was
running
a
risk
it
was
but
it
turned
out
very
well
because
the
old
gentleman
happened
to
be
a
very
eccentric
person
and
was
living
alone
so
that
his
friends
really
did
not
know
what
he
had
or
what
he
had
not
but
took
it
for
granted
that
any
watch
produced
belonged
to
him
so
if
i
were
you
in
this
case
when
the
gentleman's
horse
is
claimed
i'd
get
the
d--dest
old
screw
i
could
and
let
them
have
that
you
would
indeed
would
i
and
glory
in
it
too
as
the
very
best
thing
that
could
be
done
now
a
horse
is
of
use
to
you
i
believe
ye
it
is
exactly
but
what's
the
use
of
it
to
government
and
what's
more
if
it
went
to
the
government
there
might
be
some
excuse
but
the
government
will
know
no
more
about
it
and
make
not
so
much
as
i
shall
some
jack-in-office
will
lay
hold
of
it
as
a
thing
of
course
and
a
perquisite
when
you
might
just
as
well
and
a
great
deal
better
too
keep
it
yourself
for
it
would
do
you
some
good
as
you
say
and
none
to
them
i'll
do
it
it
is
a
good
and
a
happy
thought
there
is
no
reason
on
earth
why
i
shouldn't
do
it
and
i
will
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
it
now
well
i
am
glad
you
have
what
do
you
think
now
the
dead
man's
horse
is
worth
oh
fifty
or
sixty
guineas
value
then
very
good
then
when
the
affair
is
all
settled
i
will
trouble
you
for
twenty
pounds
you
yes
to
be
sure
who
else
do
you
suppose
is
going
to
interfere
with
you
one
is
enough
ain't
it
at
a
time
and
i
think
after
giving
you
such
advice
as
i
have
that
i
am
entitled
at
all
events
to
something
i
tell
you
what
said
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
taking
all
things
into
consideration
i
have
altered
my
mind
rather
and
won't
do
it
very
good
you
need
not
only
mind
if
you
do
i
am
down
upon
you
like
a
shot
the
excitement
contingent
upon
the
inquest
was
very
great
indeed
the
large
room
in
the
public-house
where
it
was
held
was
crowded
to
suffocation
with
persons
who
were
anxious
to
be
present
at
the
proceedings
when
the
landlord
reached
home
of
course
he
told
his
guest
the
baron
of
the
discovery
he
had
made
that
the
murdered
man
was
the
strange
visitor
of
the
previous
night
for
now
from
the
frightful
wound
he
had
received
in
his
throat
the
belief
that
he
was
murdered
became
too
rational
a
one
to
admit
of
any
doubts
and
was
that
which
was
universally
adopted
in
preference
to
any
other
suggestion
upon
the
occasion
although
no
doubt
people
would
be
found
who
would
not
scruple
to
aver
that
he
had
cut
his
own
throat
after
making
his
way
into
the
well
belonging
to
anderbury
house
the
landlord
had
his
own
misgivings
concerning
his
guest
the
baron
now
that
something
had
occurred
of
such
an
awful
and
mysterious
a
nature
to
one
who
was
evidently
known
to
him
it
did
not
seem
to
be
a
pleasant
thing
to
have
such
an
intimate
friend
of
a
man
who
had
been
murdered
in
one's
house
especially
when
it
came
to
be
considered
that
he
was
the
last
person
seen
in
his
company
and
that
consequently
he
was
peculiarly
called
upon
to
give
an
explanation
of
how
and
under
what
circumstances
he
had
parted
with
him
the
baron
was
sitting
smoking
in
the
most
unconcerned
manner
in
the
world
when
the
landlord
came
to
bring
him
this
intelligence
and
when
he
had
heard
him
to
an
end
the
remark
he
made
was--
really
you
very
much
surprise
me
but
perhaps
as
you
are
better
acquainted
with
the
town
than
i
am
you
can
tell
me
who
he
was
why
sir
that
is
what
we
hoped
you
would
be
able
to
tell
us
how
should
i
tell
you
he
introduced
himself
to
me
as
a
mr
mitchell
a
surveyor
and
he
said
that
hearing
i
talked
of
purchasing
or
renting
anderbury-on-the-mount
he
came
to
tell
me
that
the
principal
side
wall
that
you
could
see
from
the
beach
was
off
the
perpendicular
indeed
sir
yes
and
as
this
was
a
very
interesting
circumstance
to
me
considering
that
i
really
did
contemplate
such
a
purchase
or
renting
and
do
so
still
as
it
was
a
moonlight
night
and
he
said
he
could
show
me
in
a
minute
what
he
meant
if
i
would
accompany
him
i
did
so
but
when
we
got
there
and
on
the
road
i
heard
quite
enough
of
him
to
convince
me
that
he
was
a
little
out
of
his
senses
and
consequently
i
paid
no
more
attention
to
what
he
said
but
walked
home
and
left
him
on
the
beach
it's
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
sir
there
is
no
such
person
i
assure
you
as
mitchell
a
surveyor
in
the
town
so
i
can't
make
it
out
in
the
least
but
i
tell
you
i
consider
the
man
out
of
his
senses
and
perhaps
that
may
account
for
the
whole
affair
oh
yes
sir
that
would
certainly
but
still
it's
a
very
odd
thing
because
we
don't
know
of
such
a
person
at
all
and
it
does
seem
so
extraordinary
that
he
should
have
made
his
appearance
all
of
a
sudden
in
this
sort
of
way
i
suppose
sir
that
you
will
attend
the
inquest
now
that's
to
be
held
upon
him
oh
yes
i
have
no
objection
whatever
to
that
indeed
i
feel
myself
bound
to
do
so
because
i
suppose
mine
is
the
latest
evidence
that
can
be
at
all
produced
concerning
him
unquestionably
sir
our
coroner
is
a
very
clever
man
and
you
will
be
glad
to
know
him--very
glad
to
know
him
sir
and
he
will
be
glad
to
know
you
so
i
am
sure
it
will
be
a
mutual
gratification
it's
at
four
o'clock
the
inquest
is
to
be
and
i
dare
say
sir
if
you
are
there
by
half-past
it
will
be
time
enough
no
doubt
of
that
but
i
will
be
punctual
we
have
already
said
the
room
in
which
the
inquest
was
to
be
held
was
crowded
almost
to
suffocation
and
not
only
was
that
the
case
but
the
lower
part
of
the
house
was
crammed
with
people
likewise
and
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
but
the
baron
would
have
shrunk
from
such
an
investigation
from
a
number
of
curious
eyes
if
he
could
have
done
so
while
the
landlord
of
the
house
would
have
had
no
objection
as
far
as
his
profit
was
concerned
in
the
sale
of
a
great
quantity
of
beer
and
spirits
to
have
had
such
an
occurrence
every
day
in
the
week
if
possible
the
body
lay
still
in
the
shell
where
it
had
been
originally
placed
after
it
had
been
viewed
by
the
jury
and
almost
every
one
had
remarked
upon
the
extraordinary
fresh
appearance
it
wore
they
proceeded
at
once
to
the
inquiry
and
the
first
witness
who
appeared
was
mr
leek
who
deposed
to
have
been
in
company
with
some
gentlemen
viewing
anderbury
house
and
to
have
found
the
body
in
one
of
the
ice-wells
of
that
establishment
this
evidence
was
corroborated
by
that
of
davis
who
had
so
unexpectedly
jumped
into
the
well
without
being
aware
that
it
contained
already
so
disagreeable
a
visitor
as
it
did
in
the
person
of
the
murdered
man
regarding
the
cause
of
whose
death
the
present
inquiry
was
instituted
then
the
landlord
identified
the
body
as
that
of
a
gentleman
who
had
come
to
his
house
on
horseback
and
who
had
afterwards
walked
out
with
baron
stolmuyer
of
saltzburgh
who
was
one
of
his
guests
is
that
gentleman
in
attendance
said
the
coroner
yes
sir
he
is
i
told
him
about
it
and
he
has
kindly
come
forward
to
give
all
the
evidence
in
his
power
concerning
it
there
was
a
general
expression
of
interest
and
curiosity
when
the
baron
stepped
forward
attired
in
his
magnificent
coat
trimmed
with
fur
and
tendered
his
evidence
to
the
coroner
which
of
course
was
precisely
the
same
as
the
statement
he
had
made
to
the
landlord
of
the
house
for
as
he
had
made
up
such
a
well
connected
story
he
was
not
likely
to
prevaricate
or
to
depart
from
it
in
the
smallest
particular
he
was
listened
to
with
breathless
attention
and
when
he
had
concluded
the
coroner
with
a
preparatory
hem
said
to
him
and
you
have
reason
to
suppose
sir
that
this
person
was
out
of
his
senses
it
seemed
to
me
so
he
talked
wildly
and
incoherently
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
fully
induce
such
a
belief
you
left
him
on
the
beach
i
did
i
found
when
i
got
there
that
it
was
only
a
very
small
portion
indeed
of
anderbury
house
that
was
visible
and
although
the
moon
shone
brightly
i
must
confess
i
did
not
see
myself
any
signs
of
deviation
from
the
perpendicular
and
such
being
the
case
i
left
the
spot
at
once
because
i
could
have
no
further
motive
in
staying
and
moreover
it
was
not
pleasant
to
be
out
at
night
with
a
man
whom
i
thought
was
deranged
i
regretted
after
making
this
discovery
that
i
had
come
from
home
on
such
a
fool's
errand
but
as
when
one
is
going
to
invest
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
any
enterprise
one
is
naturally
anxious
to
know
all
about
it
i
went
little
suspecting
that
the
man
was
insane
did
you
see
him
after
that
certainly
not
until
to-day
when
i
recognised
in
the
body
that
has
been
exhibited
to
me
the
same
individual
gentlemen
said
the
coroner
to
the
jury
it
appears
to
me
that
this
is
a
most
mysterious
affair
the
deceased
person
has
a
wound
in
his
throat
which
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
hear
from
a
medical
witness
has
been
the
cause
of
death
and
the
most
singular
part
of
the
affair
is
how
if
he
inflicted
it
upon
himself
he
has
managed
to
dispose
of
the
weapon
with
which
he
did
the
deed
the
last
person
seen
in
his
company
said
one
of
the
jury
was
the
baron
and
i
think
he
is
bound
to
give
some
better
explanation
of
the
affair
i
am
yet
to
discover
said
the
baron
that
the
last
person
who
acknowledges
to
having
been
in
the
company
of
a
man
afterwards
murdered
must
of
necessity
be
the
murderer
yes
but
how
do
you
account
sir
for
there
being
no
weapon
found
by
which
the
man
could
have
done
the
deed
himself
i
don't
account
for
it
at
all--how
do
you
this
is
irregular
said
the
coroner
call
the
next
witness
this
was
a
medical
man
who
briefly
stated
that
he
had
seen
the
deceased
and
that
the
wound
in
his
throat
was
amply
sufficient
to
account
for
his
death
that
it
was
inflicted
with
a
sharp
instrument
having
an
edge
on
each
side
this
then
seemed
to
conclude
the
case
and
the
coroner
remarked--
gentlemen
of
the
jury--i
think
this
is
one
of
those
peculiar
cases
in
which
an
open
verdict
is
necessary
or
else
an
adjournment
without
date
so
that
the
matter
can
be
resumed
at
any
time
if
fresh
evidence
can
be
procured
concerning
it
there
is
no
one
accused
of
the
offence
although
it
appears
to
me
impossible
that
the
unhappy
man
could
have
committed
the
act
himself
we
have
no
reason
to
throw
the
least
shade
of
suspicion
or
doubt
upon
the
evidence
of
the
baron
stolmuyer
of
saltzburgh
for
as
far
as
we
know
anything
of
the
matter
the
murdered
man
may
have
been
in
the
company
of
a
dozen
people
after
the
baron
left
him
a
desultory
conversation
ensued
which
ended
in
an
adjournment
of
the
inquest
without
any
future
day
being
mentioned
for
its
re-assembling
and
so
the
baron
stolmuyer
entirely
escaped
from
what
might
have
been
a
very
serious
affair
to
him
it
did
not
however
appear
to
shake
him
in
his
resolution
of
taking
anderbury-on-the-mount
although
mr
leek
very
much
feared
it
would
but
he
announced
to
that
gentleman
his
intention
fully
of
doing
so
and
told
him
to
get
the
necessary
papers
drawn
up
forthwith
i
hope
he
said
within
a
few
weeks'
time
to
be
fairly
installed
in
that
mansion
and
then
i
will
trouble
you
mr
leek
to
give
me
a
list
of
the
names
of
all
the
best
families
in
the
neighbourhood
for
i
intend
giving
an
entertainment
on
a
grand
scale
in
the
mansion
and
grounds
sir
said
mr
leek
i
shall
with
the
greatest
pleasure
attend
upon
you
in
every
possible
way
in
this
affair
this
is
a
very
excellent
neighbourhood
and
you
will
have
no
difficulty
i
assure
you
sir
in
getting
together
an
extremely
capital
and
creditable
assemblage
of
persons
there
could
not
be
a
better
plan
devised
for
at
once
introducing
all
the
people
who
are
worth
knowing
to
you
i
thank
you
said
the
baron
i
think
the
place
will
suit
me
well
and
as
the
baroness
stolmuyer
of
saltzburgh
is
dead
i
have
some
idea
of
marrying
again
and
therefore
it
becomes
necessary
and
desirable
that
i
should
be
well
acquainted
with
the
surrounding
families
of
distinction
in
this
neighbourhood
this
was
a
hint
not
at
all
likely
to
be
thrown
away
upon
mr
leek
who
was
the
grand
gossip-monger
of
the
place
and
he
treasured
it
up
in
order
to
see
if
he
could
not
make
something
of
it
which
would
be
advantageous
to
himself
he
knew
quite
enough
of
the
select
and
fashionable
families
in
that
neighbourhood
to
be
fully
aware
that
neither
the
baron's
age
nor
his
ugliness
would
be
any
bar
to
his
forming
a
matrimonial
alliance
there
is
not
one
of
them
he
said
to
himself
who
would
not
marry
the
very
devil
himself
and
be
called
the
countess
lucifer
or
any
name
of
the
kind
always
provided
there
was
plenty
of
money
and
that
the
baron
has
without
doubt
so
it
is
equally
without
doubt
he
may
pick
and
choose
where
he
pleases
this
was
quite
correct
of
mr
leek
and
showed
his
great
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
we
entertain
with
him
a
candid
opinion
that
if
the
baron
stolmuyer
of
saltzburgh
had
been
ten
times
as
ugly
as
he
was
and
heaven
knows
that
was
needless
he
might
pick
and
choose
a
wife
almost
when
he
pleased
this
is
a
general
rule
and
as
of
course
to
all
general
rules
there
are
exceptions
this
one
cannot
be
supposed
to
be
free
from
them
under
all
circumstances
and
in
all
classes
of
society
there
are
single-minded
beings
who
consult
the
pure
dictates
of
their
own
hearts
and
who
disdaining
those
things
which
make
up
the
amount
of
the
ambition
of
meaner
spirits
stand
aloof
as
bright
and
memorable
examples
to
the
rest
of
human
nature
such
a
being
was
flora
bannerworth
she
would
never
have
been
found
to
sacrifice
herself
to
the
fancied
advantages
of
wealth
and
station
but
would
have
given
her
heart
and
hand
to
the
true
object
of
her
affection
although
a
sovereign
prince
had
made
the
endeavour
to
wean
her
from
it
end
of
project
