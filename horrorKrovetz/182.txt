preface 
the turn of the screw 

the story had held us, round the fire, sufficient breathless, but 
except the obvious remark that it was gruesome, as, on christmas eve in 
an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, i remember no 
comment utter till somebody happen to say that it was the only case 
he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. the case, 
i may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as 
had gather us for the occasion—an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to 
a little boy sleep in the room with his mother and waking her up in 
the terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him 
to sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had 
succeed in do so, the same sight that had shaken him. it was this 
observation that drew from douglas—not immediately, but later in the 
evening—a reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call 
attention. someone else told a story not particularly effective, which 
i saw he was not following. this i took for a sign that he had himself 
something to produce and that we should only have to wait. we wait in 
fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, 
he brought out what was in his mind. 

“i quite agree—in regard to griffin’s ghost, or whatever it was—that 
its appear first to the little boy, at so tender an age, add a 
particular touch. but it’s not the first occurrence of its charming 
kind that i know to have involved a child. if the child give the 
effect another turn of the screw, what do you say to _two_ children—?” 

“we say, of course,” somebody exclaimed, “that they give two turns! 
also that we want to hear about them.” 

i can see douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to 
present his back, look down at his interlocutor with his hand in 
his pockets. “nobody but me, till now, has ever heard. it’s quite too 
horrible.” this, naturally, was declared by several voice to give the 
thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his 
triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and go on: “it’s 
beyond everything. nothing at all that i know touch it.” 

“for sheer terror?” i remember asking. 

he seem to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss 
how to qualify it. he pass his hand over his eyes, made a little 
wince grimace. “for dreadful—dreadfulness!” 

“oh, how delicious!” cry one of the women. 

he took no notice of her; he look at me, but as if, instead of me, he 
saw what he spoke of. “for general uncanny ugly and horror and 
pain.” 

“well then,” i said, “just sit right down and begin.” 

he turn round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watch it an 
instant. then as he face us again: “i can’t begin. i shall have to 
send to town.” there was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach; 
after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. “the story’s 
written. it’s in a lock drawer—it has not been out for years. i could 
write to my man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as 
he find it.” it was to me in particular that he appear to propound 
this—appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate. he had broken a 
thickness of ice, the formation of many a winter; had had his reason 
for a long silence. the other resent postponement, but it was just 
his scruple that charm me. i adjure him to write by the first post 
and to agree with us for an early hearing; then i ask him if the 
experience in question had been his own. to this his answer was prompt. 
“oh, thank god, no!” 

“and is the record yours? you took the thing down?” 

“nothing but the impression. i took that _here_”—he tap his heart. 
“i’ve never lost it.” 

“then your manuscript—?” 

“is in old, fade ink, and in the most beautiful hand.” he hung fire 
again. “a woman’s. she has been dead these twenty years. she sent me 
the page in question before she died.” they were all listen now, 
and of course there was somebody to be arch, or at any rate to draw the 
inference. but if he put the inference by without a smile it was also 
without irritation. “she was a most charming person, but she was ten 
years old than i. she was my sister’s governess,” he quiet said. 
“she was the most agreeable woman i’ve ever known in her position; she 
would have been worthy of any whatever. it was long ago, and this 
episode was long before. i was at trinity, and i found her at home on 
my coming down the second summer. i was much there that year—it was a 
beautiful one; and we had, in her off-hours, some stroll and talks in 
the garden—talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice. oh 
yes; don’t grin: i like her extremely and am glad to this day to think 
she like me, too. if she hadn’t she wouldn’t have told me. she had 
never told anyone. it wasn’t simply that she said so, but that i knew 
she hadn’t. i was sure; i could see. you’ll easily judge why when you 
hear.” 

“because the thing had been such a scare?” 

he continue to fix me. “you’ll easily judge,” he repeated: “_you_ 
will.” 

i fixed him, too. “i see. she was in love.” 

he laugh for the first time. “you _are_ acute. yes, she was in love. 
that is, she had been. that came out—she couldn’t tell her story 
without its coming out. i saw it, and she saw i saw it; but neither of 
us spoke of it. i remember the time and the place—the corner of the 
lawn, the shade of the great beech and the long, hot summer 
afternoon. it wasn’t a scene for a shudder; but oh—!” he quit the 
fire and drop back into his chair. 

“you’ll receive the packet thursday morning?” i inquired. 

“probably not till the second post.” 

“well then; after dinner—” 

“you’ll all meet me here?” he look us round again. “isn’t anybody 
going?” it was almost the tone of hope. 

“everybody will stay!” 

“_i_ will”—and “_i_ will!” cry the ladies whose departure had been 
fixed. mrs. griffin, however, express the need for a little more 
light. “who was it she was in love with?” 

“the story will tell,” i took upon myself to reply. 

“oh, i can’t wait for the story!” 

“the story _won’t_ tell,” said douglas; “not in any literal, vulgar 
way.” 

“more’s the pity, then. that’s the only way i ever understand.” 

“won’t _you_ tell, douglas?” somebody else inquired. 

he sprang to his feet again. “yes—tomorrow. now i must go to bed. good 
night.” and quick catching up a candlestick, he left us slightly 
bewildered. from our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on 
the stair; whereupon mrs. griffin spoke. “well, if i don’t know who she 
was in love with, i know who _he_ was.” 

“she was ten years older,” said her husband. 

“_raison de plus_—at that age! but it’s rather nice, his long 
reticence.” 

“forty years!” griffin put in. 

“with this outbreak at last.” 

“the outbreak,” i returned, “will make a tremendous occasion of 
thursday night;” and everyone so agree with me that, in the light of 
it, we lost all attention for everything else. the last story, however 
incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we 
handshook and “candlestuck,” as somebody said, and went to bed. 

i knew the next day that a letter contain the key had, by the first 
post, gone off to his london apartments; but in spite of—or perhaps 
just on account of—the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite 
let him alone till after dinner, till such an hour of the evening, in 
fact, as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hope 
were fixed. then he became as communicative as we could desire and 
indeed gave us his best reason for being so. we had it from him again 
before the fire in the hall, as we had had our mild wonders of the 
previous night. it appear that the narrative he had promise to read 
us really require for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue. 
let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative, 
from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what i shall 
presently give. poor douglas, before his death—when it was in 
sight—committed to me the manuscript that reach him on the third of 
these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to 
read to our hush little circle on the night of the fourth. the 
depart ladies who had said they would stay didn’t, of course, thank 
heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangement made, in a 
rage of curiosity, as they professed, produce by the touch with 
which he had already work us up. but that only made his little final 
auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to 
a common thrill. 

the first of these touch convey that the written statement took up 
the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. the fact to be in 
possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of 
several daughter of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty, 
on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to 
london, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement that had 
already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser. this 
person proved, on her present herself, for judgment, at a house in 
harley street, that impress her as vast and imposing—this prospective 
patron prove a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a 
figure as had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel, before a 
fluttered, anxious girl out of a hampshire vicarage. one could easily 
fix his type; it never, happily, die out. he was handsome and bold and 
pleasant, off-hand and gay and kind. he struck her, inevitably, as 
gallant and splendid, but what took her most of all and gave her the 
courage she afterward show was that he put the whole thing to her as 
a kind of favor, an obligation he should grateful incur. she 
conceive him as rich, but as fearful extravagant—saw him all in a 
glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming 
ways with women. he had for his own town residence a big house fill 
with the spoils of travel and the trophy of the chase; but it was to 
his country home, an old family place in essex, that he wish her 
immediately to proceed. 

he had been left, by the death of their parent in india, guardian to a 
small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military 
brother, whom he had lost two years before. these children were, by the 
strangest of chance for a man in his position—a lone man without the 
right sort of experience or a grain of patience—very heavy on his 
hands. it had all been a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a 
series of blunders, but he immensely pity the poor chick and had 
done all he could; had in particular sent them down to his other house, 
the proper place for them being of course the country, and kept them 
there, from the first, with the best people he could find to look after 
them, parting even with his own servant to wait on them and go down 
himself, whenever he might, to see how they were doing. the awkward 
thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own 
affair took up all his time. he had put them in possession of bly, 
which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their 
little establishment—but below stairs only—an excellent woman, mrs. 
grose, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly 
been maid to his mother. she was now housekeeper and was also acting 
for the time as superintendent to the little girl, of whom, without 
children of her own, she was, by good luck, extremely fond. there were 
plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go 
down as governess would be in supreme authority. she would also have, 
in holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at 
school—young as he was to be sent, but what else could be done?—and 
who, as the holiday were about to begin, would be back from one day to 
the other. there had been for the two children at first a young lady 
whom they had had the misfortune to lose. she had done for them quite 
beautifully—she was a most respectable person—till her death, the great 
awkward of which had, precisely, left no alternative but the school 
for little miles. mrs. grose, since then, in the way of manners and 
things, had done as she could for flora; and there were, further, a 
cook, a housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old 
gardener, all likewise thorough respectable. 

so far had douglas present his picture when someone put a question. 
“and what did the former governess die of?—of so much respectability?” 

our friend’s answer was prompt. “that will come out. i don’t 
anticipate.” 

“excuse me—i thought that was just what you _are_ doing.” 

“in her successor’s place,” i suggested, “i should have wish to learn 
if the office brought with it—” 

“necessary danger to life?” douglas complete my thought. “she did wish 
to learn, and she did learn. you shall hear tomorrow what she learned. 
meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as slightly grim. she was 
young, untried, nervous: it was a vision of serious duty and little 
company, of really great loneliness. she hesitated—took a couple of 
days to consult and consider. but the salary offer much exceed her 
modest measure, and on a second interview she face the music, she 
engaged.” and douglas, with this, made a pause that, for the benefit of 
the company, move me to throw in— 

“the moral of which was of course the seduction exercise by the 
splendid young man. she succumb to it.” 

he got up and, as he had done the night before, went to the fire, gave 
a stir to a log with his foot, then stood a moment with his back to us. 
“she saw him only twice.” 

“yes, but that’s just the beauty of her passion.” 

a little to my surprise, on this, douglas turn round to me. “it _was_ 
the beauty of it. there were others,” he went on, “who hadn’t 
succumbed. he told her frankly all his difficulty—that for several 
applicant the conditions had been prohibitive. they were, somehow, 
simply afraid. it sound dull—it sound strange; and all the more so 
because of his main condition.” 

“which was—?” 

“that she should never trouble him—but never, never: neither appeal nor 
complain nor write about anything; only meet all question herself, 
receive all moneys from his solicitor, take the whole thing over and 
let him alone. she promise to do this, and she mention to me that 
when, for a moment, disburdened, delighted, he held her hand, thank 
her for the sacrifice, she already felt rewarded.” 

“but was that all her reward?” one of the ladies asked. 

“she never saw him again.” 

“oh!” said the lady; which, as our friend immediately left us again, 
was the only other word of importance contribute to the subject till, 
the next night, by the corner of the hearth, in the best chair, he 
open the fade red cover of a thin old-fashioned gilt-edged album. 
the whole thing took indeed more nights than one, but on the first 
occasion the same lady put another question. “what is your title?” 

“i haven’t one.” 

“oh, _i_ have!” i said. but douglas, without heed me, had begun to 
read with a fine clear that was like a rendering to the ear of the 
beauty of his author’s hand. 


i 

i remember the whole beginning as a succession of flight and drops, a 
little seesaw of the right throb and the wrong. after rising, in town, 
to meet his appeal, i had at all event a couple of very bad days—found 
myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure i had made a mistake. in this 
state of mind i spent the long hour of bumping, swinging coach that 
carry me to the stopping place at which i was to be met by a vehicle 
from the house. this convenience, i was told, had been ordered, and i 
found, toward the close of the june afternoon, a commodious fly in 
wait for me. driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a 
country to which the summer sweet seem to offer me a friendly 
welcome, my fortitude mount afresh and, as we turn into the avenue, 
encounter a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to 
which it had sunk. i suppose i had expected, or had dreaded, something 
so melancholy that what greet me was a good surprise. i remember as a 
most pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open window and 
fresh curtains and the pair of maid look out; i remember the lawn 
and the bright flower and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and 
the cluster treetop over which the rook circle and caw in the 
golden sky. the scene had a great that made it a different affair 
from my own scant home, and there immediately appear at the door, 
with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who drop me as decent 
a curtsy as if i had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor. i 
had received in harley street a narrow notion of the place, and that, 
as i recall it, made me think the proprietor still more of a 
gentleman, suggest that what i was to enjoy might be something beyond 
his promise. 

i had no drop again till the next day, for i was carry triumphant 
through the following hour by my introduction to the younger of my 
pupils. the little girl who accompany mrs. grose appear to me on 
the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have 
to do with her. she was the most beautiful child i had ever seen, and i 
afterward wonder that my employer had not told me more of her. i 
slept little that night—i was too much excited; and this astonish me, 
too, i recollect, remain with me, add to my sense of the 
liberality with which i was treated. the large, impressive room, one of 
the best in the house, the great state bed, as i almost felt it, the 
full, figured draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time, 
i could see myself from head to foot, all struck me—like the 
extraordinary charm of my small charge—as so many things thrown in. it 
was thrown in as well, from the first moment, that i should get on with 
mrs. grose in a relation over which, on my way, in the coach, i fear i 
had rather brooded. the only thing indeed that in this early outlook 
might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being 
so glad to see me. i perceive within half an hour that she was so 
glad—stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman—as to be positively 
on her guard against showing it too much. i wonder even then a little 
why she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with 
suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy. 

but it was a comfort that there could be no uneasy in a connection 
with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl, the 
vision of whose angel beauty had probably more than anything else to 
do with the restless that, before morning, made me several times 
rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and 
prospect; to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look 
at such portion of the rest of the house as i could catch, and to 
listen, while, in the fade dusk, the first bird began to twitter, 
for the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not 
without, but within, that i had fancy i heard. there had been a 
moment when i believe i recognized, faint and far, the cry of a child; 
there had been another when i found myself just conscious start as 
at the passage, before my door, of a light footstep. but these fancies 
were not marked enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the 
light, or the gloom, i should rather say, of other and subsequent 
matter that they now come back to me. to watch, teach, “form” little 
flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life. it 
had been agree between us downstairs that after this first occasion i 
should have her as a matter of course at night, her small white bed 
being already arranged, to that end, in my room. what i had undertaken 
was the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time, 
with mrs. grose only as an effect of our consideration for my 
inevitable strange and her natural timidity. in spite of this 
timidity—which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had 
been perfectly frank and brave about, allow it, without a sign of 
uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serene indeed of 
one of raphael’s holy infants, to be discussed, to be impute to her, 
and to determine us—i feel quite sure she would presently like me. it 
was part of what i already like mrs. grose herself for, the pleasure i 
could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as i sat at supper with 
four tall candle and with my pupil, in a high chair and a bib, 
bright facing me, between them, over bread and milk. there were 
naturally things that in flora’s presence could pass between us only as 
prodigious and gratify looks, obscure and roundabout allusions. 

“and the little boy—does he look like her? is he too so very 
remarkable?” 

one wouldn’t flatter a child. “oh, miss, _most_ remarkable. if you 
think well of this one!”—and she stood there with a plate in her hand, 
beam at our companion, who look from one of us to the other with 
placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us. 

“yes; if i do—?” 

“you _will_ be carry away by the little gentleman!” 

“well, that, i think, is what i came for—to be carry away. i’m 
afraid, however,” i remember feeling the impulse to add, “i’m rather 
easily carry away. i was carry away in london!” 

i can still see mrs. grose’s broad face as she took this in. “in harley 
street?” 

“in harley street.” 

“well, miss, you’re not the first—and you won’t be the last.” 

“oh, i’ve no pretension,” i could laugh, “to being the only one. my 
other pupil, at any rate, as i understand, come back tomorrow?” 

“not tomorrow—friday, miss. he arrives, as you did, by the coach, under 
care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.” 

i forthwith express that the proper as well as the pleasant and 
friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public 
conveyance i should be in wait for him with his little sister; an 
idea in which mrs. grose concur so heartily that i somehow took her 
manner as a kind of comfort pledge—never falsified, thank 
heaven!—that we should on every question be quite at one. oh, she was 
glad i was there! 

what i felt the next day was, i suppose, nothing that could be fairly 
call a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at the 
most only a slight oppression produce by a fuller measure of the 
scale, as i walk round them, gaze up at them, took them in, of my 
new circumstances. they had, as it were, an extent and mass for which i 
had not been prepared and in the presence of which i found myself, 
freshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. lessons, in this 
agitation, certainly suffer some delay; i reflect that my first 
duty was, by the gentlest arts i could contrive, to win the child into 
the sense of knowing me. i spent the day with her out-of-doors; i 
arrange with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should be she, 
she only, who might show me the place. she show it step by step and 
room by room and secret by secret, with droll, delightful, childish 
talk about it and with the result, in half an hour, of our becoming 
immense friends. young as she was, i was struck, throughout our little 
tour, with her confidence and courage with the way, in empty chambers 
and dull corridors, on crooked staircase that made me pause and even 
on the summit of an old machicolate square tower that made me dizzy, 
her morning music, her disposition to tell me so many more things than 
she asked, rang out and led me on. i have not seen b since the day i 
left it, and i daresay that to my old and more informed eyes it would 
now appear sufficient contracted. but as my little conductress, with 
her hair of gold and her frock of blue, dance before me round corner 
and patter down passages, i had the view of a castle of romance 
inhabit by a rosy sprite, such a place as would somehow, for 
diversion of the young idea, take all color out of storybook and 
fairytales. wasn’t it just a storybook over which i had fallen adoze 
and adream? no; it was a big, ugly, antique, but convenient house, 
embody a few features of a building still older, half-replaced and 
half-utilized, in which i had the fancy of our being almost as lost as 
a handful of passenger in a great drift ship. well, i was, 
strangely, at the helm! 


ii 

this came home to me when, two days later, i drove over with flora to 
meet, as mrs. grose said, the little gentleman; and all the more for an 
incident that, present itself the second evening, had deep 
disconcert me. the first day had been, on the whole, as i have 
expressed, reassuring; but i was to see it wind up in keen 
apprehension. the postbag, that evening—it came late—contained a letter 
for me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, i found to be 
compose but of a few words enclose another, address to himself, 
with a seal still unbroken. “this, i recognize, is from the headmaster, 
and the headmaster’s an awful bore. read him, please; deal with him; 
but mind you don’t report. not a word. i’m off!” i broke the seal with 
a great effort—so great a one that i was a long time coming to it; took 
the unopened missive at last up to my room and only attack it just 
before go to bed. i had better have let it wait till morning, for it 
gave me a second sleepless night. with no counsel to take, the next 
day, i was full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me 
that i determined to open myself at least to mrs. grose. 

“what do it mean? the child’s dismiss his school.” 

she gave me a look that i remark at the moment; then, visibly, with a 
quick blankness, seem to try to take it back. “but aren’t they all—?” 

“sent home—yes. but only for the holidays. mile may never go back at 
all.” 

consciously, under my attention, she reddened. “they won’t take him?” 

“they absolutely decline.” 

at this she raise her eyes, which she had turn from me; i saw them 
fill with good tears. “what has he done?” 

i hesitated; then i judge best simply to hand her my letter—which, 
however, had the effect of making her, without taking it, simply put 
her hand behind her. she shook her head sadly. “such things are not 
for me, miss.” 

my counselor couldn’t read! i wince at my mistake, which i attenuate 
as i could, and open my letter again to repeat it to her; then, 
falter in the act and fold it up once more, i put it back in my 
pocket. “is he really _bad_?” 

the tear were still in her eyes. “do the gentlemen say so?” 

“they go into no particulars. they simply express their regret that it 
should be impossible to keep him. that can have only one meaning.” mrs. 
grose listen with dumb emotion; she forbore to ask me what this 
meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with some 
coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, i went 
on: “that he’s an injury to the others.” 

at this, with one of the quick turn of simple folk, she sudden 
flame up. “master miles! _him_ an injury?” 

there was such a flood of good faith in it that, though i had not yet 
seen the child, my very fear made me jump to the absurd of the 
idea. i found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the 
spot, sarcastically. “to his poor little innocent mates!” 

“it’s too dreadful,” cry mrs. grose, “to say such cruel things! why, 
he’s scarce ten years old.” 

“yes, yes; it would be incredible.” 

she was evidently grateful for such a profession. “see him, miss, 
first. _then_ believe it!” i felt forthwith a new impatience to see 
him; it was the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next hours, 
was to deepen almost to pain. mrs. grose was aware, i could judge, of 
what she had produce in me, and she follow it up with assurance. 
“you might as well believe it of the little lady. bless her,” she add 
the next moment—“_look_ at her!” 

i turn and saw that flora, whom, ten minutes before, i had 
establish in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil, 
and a copy of nice “round o’s,” now present herself to view at the 
open door. she express in her little way an extraordinary detachment 
from disagreeable duties, look to me, however, with a great childish 
light that seem to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had 
conceive for my person, which had render necessary that she should 
follow me. i need nothing more than this to feel the full force of 
mrs. grose’s comparison, and, catching my pupil in my arms, cover her 
with kiss in which there was a sob of atonement. 

nonetheless, the rest of the day i watch for further occasion to 
approach my colleague, especially as, toward evening, i began to fancy 
she rather sought to avoid me. i overtook her, i remember, on the 
staircase; we went down together, and at the bottom i detain her, 
holding her there with a hand on her arm. “i take what you said to me 
at noon as a declaration that _you’ve_ never known him to be bad.” 

she threw back her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very 
honestly, adopt an attitude. “oh, never known him—i don’t pretend 
_that!_” 

i was upset again. “then you _have_ known him—?” 

“yes indeed, miss, thank god!” 

on reflection i accept this. “you mean that a boy who never is—?” 

“is no boy for _me!_” 

i held her tighter. “you like them with the spirit to be naughty?” 
then, keeping pace with her answer, “so do i!” i eager brought out. 
“but not to the degree to contaminate—” 

“to contaminate?”—my big word left her at a loss. i explain it. “to 
corrupt.” 

she stared, taking my meaning in; but it produce in her an odd laugh. 
“are you afraid he’ll corrupt _you?_” she put the question with such a 
fine bold humor that, with a laugh, a little silly doubtless, to match 
her own, i gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule. 

but the next day, as the hour for my drive approached, i crop up in 
another place. “what was the lady who was here before?” 

“the last governess? she was also young and pretty—almost as young and 
almost as pretty, miss, even as you.” 

“ah, then, i hope her youth and her beauty help her!” i recollect 
throw off. “he seem to like us young and pretty!” 

“oh, he _did_,” mrs. grose assented: “it was the way he like 
everyone!” she had no soon spoken indeed than she caught herself up. 
“i mean that’s _his_ way—the master’s.” 

i was struck. “but of whom did you speak first?” 

she look blank, but she colored. “why, of _him_.” 

“of the master?” 

“of who else?” 

there was so obviously no one else that the next moment i had lost my 
impression of her have accidental said more than she meant; and i 
merely ask what i want to know. “did _she_ see anything in the 
boy—?” 

“that wasn’t right? she never told me.” 

i had a scruple, but i overcame it. “was she careful—particular?” 

mrs. grose appear to try to be conscientious. “about some 
things—yes.” 

“but not about all?” 

again she considered. “well, miss—she’s gone. i won’t tell tales.” 

“i quite understand your feeling,” i hasten to reply; but i thought 
it, after an instant, not oppose to this concession to pursue: “did 
she die here?” 

“no—she went off.” 

i don’t know what there was in this brevity of mrs. grose’s that struck 
me as ambiguous. “went off to die?” mrs. grose look straight out of 
the window, but i felt that, hypothetically, i had a right to know what 
young person engaged for b were expect to do. “she was taken ill, 
you mean, and went home?” 

“she was not taken ill, so far as appeared, in this house. she left it, 
at the end of the year, to go home, as she said, for a short holiday, 
to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right. we 
had then a young woman—a nursemaid who had stay on and who was a good 
girl and clever; and _she_ took the children altogether for the 
interval. but our young lady never came back, and at the very moment i 
was expect her i heard from the master that she was dead.” 

i turn this over. “but of what?” 

“he never told me! but please, miss,” said mrs. grose, “i must get to 
my work.” 


iii 

her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just 
preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual 
esteem. we met, after i had brought home little miles, more intimate 
than ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so 
monstrous was i then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now 
been reveal to me should be under an interdict. i was a little late 
on the scene, and i felt, as he stood wistful look out for me 
before the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down, that i 
had seen him, on the instant, without and within, in the great glow of 
freshness, the same positive fragrance of purity, in which i had, from 
the first moment, seen his little sister. he was incredible beautiful, 
and mrs. grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of 
passion of tender for him was swept away by his presence. what i 
then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that i 
have never found to the same degree in any child—his indescribable 
little air of knowing nothing in the world but love. it would have been 
impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweet of innocence, 
and by the time i had got back to b with him i remain merely 
bewildered—so far, that is, as i was not outraged—by the sense of the 
horrible letter lock up in my room, in a drawer. as soon as i could 
compass a private word with mrs. grose i declared to her that it was 
grotesque. 

she prompt understood me. “you mean the cruel charge—?” 

“it doesn’t live an instant. my dear woman, _look_ at him!” 

she smile at my pretention to have discover his charm. “i assure 
you, miss, i do nothing else! what will you say, then?” she immediately 
added. 

“in answer to the letter?” i had made up my mind. “nothing.” 

“and to his uncle?” 

i was incisive. “nothing.” 

“and to the boy himself?” 

i was wonderful. “nothing.” 

she gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth. “then i’ll stand by 
you. we’ll see it out.” 

“we’ll see it out!” i ardent echoed, give her my hand to make it a 
vow. 

she held me there a moment, then whisk up her apron again with her 
detached hand. “would you mind, miss, if i use the freedom—” 

“to kiss me? no!” i took the good creature in my arms and, after we had 
embrace like sisters, felt still more fortify and indignant. 

this, at all events, was for the time: a time so full that, as i recall 
the way it went, it remind me of all the art i now need to make it a 
little distinct. what i look back at with amaze is the situation i 
accepted. i had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and i was 
under a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the 
far and difficult connection of such an effort. i was lift aloft on 
a great wave of infatuation and pity. i found it simple, in my 
ignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit, to assume that i could 
deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of 
beginning. i am unable even to remember at this day what proposal i 
frame for the end of his holiday and the resumption of his studies. 
lesson with me, indeed, that charming summer, we all had a theory that 
he was to have; but i now feel that, for weeks, the lesson must have 
been rather my own. i learned something—at first, certainly—that had 
not been one of the teaching of my small, smother life; learned to 
be amused, and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. it was 
the first time, in a manner, that i had known space and air and 
freedom, all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature. and 
then there was consideration—and consideration was sweet. oh, it was a 
trap—not designed, but deep—to my imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps 
to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was most excitable. the best way to 
picture it all is to say that i was off my guard. they gave me so 
little trouble—they were of a gentle so extraordinary. i use to 
speculate—but even this with a dim disconnectedness—as to how the rough 
future (for all futures are rough!) would handle them and might bruise 
them. they had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if i had 
been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of prince of the blood, 
for whom everything, to be right, would have to be enclose and 
protected, the only form that, in my fancy, the afteryear could take 
for them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden 
and the park. it may be, of course, above all, that what sudden broke 
into this give the previous time a charm of stillness—that hush in 
which something gather or crouches. the change was actually like the 
spring of a beast. 

in the first week the days were long; they often, at their finest, 
gave me what i use to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils, 
teatime and bedtime have come and gone, i had, before my final 
retirement, a small interval alone. much as i like my companions, this 
hour was the thing in the day i like most; and i like it best of all 
when, as the light faded—or rather, i should say, the day linger and 
the last call of the last bird sounded, in a flushed sky, from the 
old trees—i could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy, almost with a 
sense of property that amuse and flatter me, the beauty and dignity 
of the place. it was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself 
tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by my 
discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, i was 
give pleasure—if he ever thought of it!—to the person to whose 
pressure i had responded. what i was do was what he had earnest 
hope and directly ask of me, and that i _could_, after all, do it 
prove even a greater joy than i had expected. i daresay i fancy 
myself, in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the 
faith that this would more public appear. well, i need to be 
remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently 
gave their first sign. 

it was plump, one afternoon, in the middle of my very hour: the 
children were tuck away, and i had come out for my stroll. one of the 
thought that, as i don’t in the least shrink now from noting, use to 
be with me in these wanderings was that it would be as charming as a 
charming story sudden to meet someone. someone would appear there at 
the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve. i 
didn’t ask more than that—i only ask that he should _know;_ and the 
only way to be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of 
it, in his handsome face. that was exactly present to me—by which i 
mean the face was—when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of 
a long june day, i stop short on emerge from one of the 
plantation and coming into view of the house. what arrest me on the 
spot—and with a shock much greater than any vision had allow for—was 
the sense that my imagination had, in a flash, turn real. he did 
stand there!—but high up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the 
tower to which, on that first morning, little flora had conduct me. 
this tower was one of a pair—square, incongruous, crenelated 
structures—that were distinguished, for some reason, though i could see 
little difference, as the new and the old. they flank opposite end 
of the house and were probably architecture absurdities, redeem in a 
measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too 
pretentious, dating, in their gingerbread antiquity, from a romantic 
revival that was already a respectable past. i admire them, had 
fancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially 
when they loom through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual 
battlements; yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure i had 
so often invoke seem most in place. 

it produce in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, i remember, two 
distinct gasp of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first 
and that of my second surprise. my second was a violent perception of 
the mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person i 
had precipitate supposed. there came to me thus a bewilder of 
vision of which, after these years, there is no living view that i can 
hope to give. an unknown man in a lonely place is a permit object of 
fear to a young woman private bred; and the figure that face me 
was—a few more seconds assured me—as little anyone else i knew as it 
was the image that had been in my mind. i had not seen it in harley 
street—i had not seen it anywhere. the place, moreover, in the 
strangest way in the world, had, on the instant, and by the very fact 
of its appearance, become a solitude. to me at least, making my 
statement here with a deliberation with which i have never made it, the 
whole feeling of the moment returns. it was as if, while i took in—what 
i did take in—all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death. i 
can hear again, as i write, the intense hush in which the sound of 
evening dropped. the rook stop caw in the golden sky, and the 
friendly hour lost, for the minute, all its voice. but there was no 
other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that i saw with 
a stranger sharpness. the gold was still in the sky, the clear in 
the air, and the man who look at me over the battlements was as 
definite as a picture in a frame. that’s how i thought, with 
extraordinary quickness, of each person that he might have been and 
that he was not. we were confront across our distance quite long 
enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel, 
as an effect of my inability to say, a wonder that in a few instant 
more became intense. 

the great question, or one of these, is, afterward, i know, with regard 
to certain matters, the question of how long they have lasted. well, 
this matter of mine, think what you will of it, last while i caught 
at a dozen possibilities, none of which made a difference for the 
better, that i could see, in there have been in the house—and for how 
long, above all?—a person of whom i was in ignorance. it last while i 
just bridle a little with the sense that my office demand that there 
should be no such ignorance and no such person. it last while this 
visitant, at all events—and there was a touch of the strange freedom, 
as i remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat—seemed 
to fix me, from his position, with just the question, just the scrutiny 
through the fade light, that his own presence provoked. we were too 
far apart to call to each other, but there was a moment at which, at 
short range, some challenge between us, break the hush, would have 
been the right result of our straight mutual stare. he was in one of 
the angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it struck me, 
and with both hand on the ledge. so i saw him as i see the letters i 
form on this page; then, exactly, after a minute, as if to add to the 
spectacle, he slow change his place—passed, look at me hard all 
the while, to the opposite corner of the platform. yes, i had the 
sharpest sense that during this transit he never took his eyes from me, 
and i can see at this moment the way his hand, as he went, pass from 
one of the crenelation to the next. he stop at the other corner, 
but less long, and even as he turn away still marked fixed me. he 
turn away; that was all i knew. 


iv 

it was not that i didn’t wait, on this occasion, for more, for i was 
rooted as deep as i was shaken. was there a “secret” at bly—a mystery 
of udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected 
confinement? i can’t say how long i turn it over, or how long, in a 
confusion of curiosity and dread, i remain where i had had my 
collision; i only recall that when i re-entered the house dark had 
quite closed in. agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and 
driven me, for i must, in circle about the place, have walk three 
miles; but i was to be, later on, so much more overwhelm that this 
mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. the most singular 
part of it, in fact—singular as the rest had been—was the part i 
became, in the hall, aware of in meeting mrs. grose. this picture come 
back to me in the general train—the impression, as i received it on my 
return, of the wide white panel space, bright in the lamplight and 
with its portrait and red carpet, and of the good surprise look of my 
friend, which immediately told me she had miss me. it came to me 
straightway, under her contact, that, with plain heartiness, mere 
relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could 
bear upon the incident i had there ready for her. i had not suspect 
in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up, and i somehow 
measured the importance of what i had seen by my thus finding myself 
hesitate to mention it. scarce anything in the whole history seem to 
me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one, as i may 
say, with the instinct of sparing my companion. on the spot, 
accordingly, in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me, i, for a 
reason that i couldn’t then have phrased, achieve an inward 
resolution—offered a vague pretext for my late and, with the plea 
of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as 
soon as possible to my room. 

here it was another affair; here, for many days after, it was a queer 
affair enough. there were hours, from day to day—or at least there were 
moments, snatch even from clear duties—when i had to shut myself up 
to think. it was not so much yet that i was more nervous than i could 
bear to be as that i was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the 
truth i had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that i 
could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom i had been 
so inexplicably and yet, as it seem to me, so intimate concerned. 
it took little time to see that i could sound without form of inquiry 
and without exciting remark any domestic complications. the shock i had 
suffer must have sharpen all my senses; i felt sure, at the end of 
three days and as the result of mere close attention, that i had not 
been practiced upon by the servant nor made the object of any “game.” 
of whatever it was that i knew, nothing was known around me. there was 
but one sane inference: someone had taken a liberty rather gross. that 
was what, repeatedly, i dip into my room and lock the door to say 
to myself. we had been, collectively, subject to an intrusion; some 
unscrupulous traveler, curious in old houses, had made his way in 
unobserved, enjoy the prospect from the best point of view, and then 
stolen out as he came. if he had given me such a bold hard stare, that 
was but a part of his indiscretion. the good thing, after all, was that 
we should surely see no more of him. 

this was not so good a thing, i admit, as not to leave me to judge that 
what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my 
charming work. my charming work was just my life with mile and flora, 
and through nothing could i so like it as through feeling that i could 
throw myself into it in trouble. the attraction of my small charge was 
a constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my 
original fears, the distaste i had begun by entertaining for the 
probable gray prose of my office. there was to be no gray prose, it 
appeared, and no long grind; so how could work not be charming that 
present itself as daily beauty? it was all the romance of the nursery 
and the poetry of the schoolroom. i don’t mean by this, of course, that 
we studied only fiction and verse; i mean i can express no otherwise 
the sort of interest my companion inspired. how can i describe that 
except by saying that instead of grow use to them—and it’s a marvel 
for a governess: i call the sisterhood to witness!—i made constant 
fresh discoveries. there was one direction, assuredly, in which these 
discovery stopped: deep obscurity continue to cover the region of 
the boy’s conduct at school. it had been prompt given me, i have 
noted, to face that mystery without a pang. perhaps even it would be 
near the truth to say that—without a word—he himself had clear it 
up. he had made the whole charge absurd. my conclusion bloom there 
with the real rose flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and 
fair for the little horrid, unclean school-world, and he had paid a 
price for it. i reflect acute that the sense of such differences, 
such superior of quality, always, on the part of the 
majority—which could include even stupid, sordid headmasters—turn 
infallibly to the vindictive. 

both the children had a gentle (it was their only fault, and it 
never made mile a muff) that kept them—how shall i express it?—almost 
impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. they were like the cherub 
of the anecdote, who had—morally, at any rate—nothing to whack! i 
remember feeling with mile in especial as if he had had, as it were, 
no history. we expect of a small child a scant one, but there was in 
this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive, yet 
extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any creature of his age i 
have seen, struck me as beginning anew each day. he had never for a 
second suffered. i took this as a direct disproof of his have really 
been chastised. if he had been wicked he would have “caught” it, and i 
should have caught it by the rebound—i should have found the trace. i 
found nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. he never spoke of 
his school, never mention a comrade or a master; and i, for my part, 
was quite too much disgust to allude to them. of course i was under 
the spell, and the wonderful part is that, even at the time, i 
perfectly knew i was. but i gave myself up to it; it was an antidote to 
any pain, and i had more pains than one. i was in receipt in these days 
of disturb letters from home, where things were not go well. but 
with my children, what things in the world mattered? that was the 
question i use to put to my scrappy retirements. i was dazzle by 
their loveliness. 

there was a sunday—to get on—when it rain with such force and for so 
many hour that there could be no procession to church; in consequence 
of which, as the day declined, i had arrange with mrs. grose that, 
should the evening show improvement, we would attend together the late 
service. the rain happily stopped, and i prepared for our walk, which, 
through the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter 
of twenty minutes. coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall, 
i remember a pair of glove that had require three stitch and that 
had received them—with a publicity perhaps not edifying—while i sat 
with the children at their tea, serve on sundays, by exception, in 
that cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the “grown-up” dine 
room. the glove had been drop there, and i turn in to recover 
them. the day was gray enough, but the afternoon light still lingered, 
and it enable me, on crossing the threshold, not only to recognize, on 
a chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles i wanted, but 
to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and look 
straight in. one step into the room had sufficed; my vision was 
instantaneous; it was all there. the person look straight in was the 
person who had already appear to me. he appear thus again with i 
won’t say greater distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a 
near that represent a forward stride in our intercourse and made 
me, as i met him, catch my breath and turn cold. he was the same—he was 
the same, and seen, this time, as he had been seen before, from the 
waist up, the window, though the dine room was on the ground floor, 
not go down to the terrace on which he stood. his face was close to 
the glass, yet the effect of this better view was, strangely, only to 
show me how intense the former had been. he remain but a few 
seconds—long enough to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it 
was as if i had been look at him for years and had known him always. 
something, however, happen this time that had not happen before; 
his stare into my face, through the glass and across the room, was as 
deep and hard as then, but it quit me for a moment during which i 
could still watch it, see it fix successive several other things. on 
the spot there came to me the add shock of a certitude that it was 
not for me he had come there. he had come for someone else. 

the flash of this knowledge—for it was knowledge in the midst of 
dread—produced in me the most extraordinary effect, start as i stood 
there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. i say courage because i 
was beyond all doubt already far gone. i bound straight out of the 
door again, reach that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the 
drive, and, passing along the terrace as fast as i could rush, turn a 
corner and came full in sight. but it was in sight of nothing now—my 
visitor had vanished. i stopped, i almost dropped, with the real relief 
of this; but i took in the whole scene—i gave him time to reappear. i 
call it time, but how long was it? i can’t speak to the purpose today 
of the duration of these things. that kind of measure must have left 
me: they couldn’t have last as they actually appear to me to last. 
the terrace and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all 
i could see of the park, were empty with a great emptiness. there were 
shrubbery and big trees, but i remember the clear assurance i felt 
that none of them conceal him. he was there or was not there: not 
there if i didn’t see him. i got hold of this; then, instinctively, 
instead of return as i had come, went to the window. it was 
confused present to me that i ought to place myself where he had 
stood. i did so; i applied my face to the pane and looked, as he had 
looked, into the room. as if, at this moment, to show me exactly what 
his range had been, mrs. grose, as i had done for himself just before, 
came in from the hall. with this i had the full image of a repetition 
of what had already occurred. she saw me as i had seen my own visitant; 
she pull up short as i had done; i gave her something of the shock 
that i had received. she turn white, and this made me ask myself if i 
had blanch as much. she stared, in short, and retreat on just _my_ 
lines, and i knew she had then pass out and come round to me and that 
i should presently meet her. i remain where i was, and while i wait 
i thought of more things than one. but there’s only one i take space to 
mention. i wonder why _she_ should be scared. 


v 

oh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house, she 
loom again into view. “what in the name of goodness is the matter—?” 
she was now flushed and out of breath. 

i said nothing till she came quite near. “with me?” i must have made a 
wonderful face. “do i show it?” 

“you’re as white as a sheet. you look awful.” 

i considered; i could meet on this, without scruple, any innocence. my 
need to respect the bloom of mrs. grose’s had dropped, without a 
rustle, from my shoulders, and if i waver for the instant it was not 
with what i kept back. i put out my hand to her and she took it; i held 
her hard a little, liking to feel her close to me. there was a kind of 
support in the shy heave of her surprise. “you came for me for church, 
of course, but i can’t go.” 

“has anything happened?” 

“yes. you must know now. did i look very queer?” 

“through this window? dreadful!” 

“well,” i said, “i’ve been frightened.” mrs. grose’s eyes express 
plainly that _she_ had no wish to be, yet also that she knew too well 
her place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience. 
oh, it was quite settled that she _must_ share! “just what you saw from 
the dine room a minute ago was the effect of that. what _i_ saw—just 
before—was much worse.” 

her hand tightened. “what was it?” 

“an extraordinary man. look in.” 

“what extraordinary man?” 

“i haven’t the least idea.” 

mrs. grose gaze round us in vain. “then where is he gone?” 

“i know still less.” 

“have you seen him before?” 

“yes—once. on the old tower.” 

she could only look at me harder. “do you mean he’s a stranger?” 

“oh, very much!” 

“yet you didn’t tell me?” 

“no—for reasons. but now that you’ve guessed—” 

mrs. grose’s round eyes encounter this charge. “ah, i haven’t 
guessed!” she said very simply. “how can i if _you_ don’t imagine?” 

“i don’t in the very least.” 

“you’ve seen him nowhere but on the tower?” 

“and on this spot just now.” 

mrs. grose look round again. “what was he do on the tower?” 

“only standing there and look down at me.” 

she thought a minute. “was he a gentleman?” 

i found i had no need to think. “no.” she gaze in deep wonder. “no.” 

“then nobody about the place? nobody from the village?” 

“nobody—nobody. i didn’t tell you, but i made sure.” 

she breathe a vague relief: this was, oddly, so much to the good. it 
only went indeed a little way. “but if he isn’t a gentleman—” 

“what _is_ he? he’s a horror.” 

“a horror?” 

“he’s—god help me if i know _what_ he is!” 

mrs. grose look round once more; she fixed her eyes on the dusky 
distance, then, pull herself together, turn to me with abrupt 
inconsequence. “it’s time we should be at church.” 

“oh, i’m not fit for church!” 

“won’t it do you good?” 

“it won’t do _them!_— i nod at the house. 

“the children?” 

“i can’t leave them now.” 

“you’re afraid—?” 

i spoke boldly. “i’m afraid of _him_.” 

mrs. grose’s large face show me, at this, for the first time, the 
faraway faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute: i somehow made out 
in it the delay dawn of an idea i myself had not given her and that 
was as yet quite obscure to me. it come back to me that i thought 
instantly of this as something i could get from her; and i felt it to 
be connected with the desire she presently show to know more. “when 
was it—on the tower?” 

“about the middle of the month. at this same hour.” 

“almost at dark,” said mrs. grose. 

“oh, no, not nearly. i saw him as i see you.” 

“then how did he get in?” 

“and how did he get out?” i laughed. “i had no opportunity to ask him! 
this evening, you see,” i pursued, “he has not been able to get in.” 

“he only peeps?” 

“i hope it will be confine to that!” she had now let go my hand; she 
turn away a little. i wait an instant; then i brought out: “go to 
church. goodbye. i must watch.” 

slow she face me again. “do you fear for them?” 

we met in another long look. “don’t _you?_” instead of answer she 
came near to the window and, for a minute, applied her face to the 
glass. “you see how he could see,” i meanwhile went on. 

she didn’t move. “how long was he here?” 

“till i came out. i came to meet him.” 

mrs. grose at last turn round, and there was still more in her face. 
“_i_ couldn’t have come out.” 

“neither could i!” i laugh again. “but i did come. i have my duty.” 

“so have i mine,” she replied; after which she added: “what is he 
like?” 

“i’ve been die to tell you. but he’s like nobody.” 

“nobody?” she echoed. 

“he has no hat.” then seeing in her face that she already, in this, 
with a deep dismay, found a touch of picture, i quick add stroke 
to stroke. “he has red hair, very red, close-curling, and a pale face, 
long in shape, with straight, good features and little, rather queer 
whiskers that are as red as his hair. his eyebrow are, somehow, 
darker; they look particularly arch and as if they might move a good 
deal. his eyes are sharp, strange—awfully; but i only know clearly that 
they’re rather small and very fixed. his mouth’s wide, and his lip are 
thin, and except for his little whiskers he’s quite clean-shaven. he 
give me a sort of sense of look like an actor.” 

“an actor!” it was impossible to resemble one less, at least, than mrs. 
grose at that moment. 

“i’ve never seen one, but so i suppose them. he’s tall, active, erect,” 
i continued, “but never—no, never!—a gentleman.” 

my companion’s face had blanch as i went on; her round eyes start 
and her mild mouth gaped. “a gentleman?” she gasped, confounded, 
stupefied: “a gentleman _he?_” 

“you know him then?” 

she visibly try to hold herself. “but he _is_ handsome?” 

i saw the way to help her. “remarkably!” 

“and dressed—?” 

“in somebody’s clothes.” “they’re smart, but they’re not his own.” 

she broke into a breathless affirmative groan: “they’re the master’s!” 

i caught it up. “you _do_ know him?” 

she falter but a second. “quint!” she cried. 

“quint?” 

“peter quint—his own man, his valet, when he was here!” 

“when the master was?” 

gape still, but meeting me, she piece it all together. “he never 
wore his hat, but he did wear—well, there were waistcoat missed. they 
were both here—last year. then the master went, and quint was alone.” 

i followed, but halting a little. “alone?” 

“alone with _us_.” then, as from a deep depth, “in charge,” she 
added. 

“and what became of him?” 

she hung fire so long that i was still more mystified. “he went, too,” 
she brought out at last. 

“went where?” 

her expression, at this, became extraordinary. “god know where! he 
died.” 

“died?” i almost shrieked. 

she seem fairly to square herself, plant herself more firm to utter 
the wonder of it. “yes. mr. quint is dead.” 


vi 

it took of course more than that particular passage to place us 
together in presence of what we had now to live with as we could—my 
dreadful liability to impression of the order so vivid exemplified, 
and my companion’s knowledge, henceforth—a knowledge half consternation 
and half compassion—of that liability. there had been, this evening, 
after the revelation left me, for an hour, so prostrate—there had been, 
for either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of 
tear and vows, of prayer and promises, a climax to the series of 
mutual challenge and pledge that had straightway ensue on our 
retreat together to the schoolroom and shut ourselves up there 
to have everything out. the result of our have everything out was 
simply to reduce our situation to the last rigor of its elements. she 
herself had seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody in the 
house but the governess was in the governess’s plight; yet she accept 
without directly impugn my sanity the truth as i gave it to her, and 
end by showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness, an 
expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of 
which the very breath has remain with me as that of the sweetest of 
human charities. 

what was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we 
thought we might bear things together; and i was not even sure that, in 
spite of her exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden. i 
knew at this hour, i think, as well as i knew later, what i was capable 
of meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly 
sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so 
compromise a contract. i was queer company enough—quite as queer as 
the company i received; but as i trace over what we went through i see 
how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that, by good 
fortune, _could_ steady us. it was the idea, the second movement, that 
led me straight out, as i may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. i 
could take the air in the court, at least, and there mrs. grose could 
join me. perfectly can i recall now the particular way strength came to 
me before we separate for the night. we had gone over and over every 
feature of what i had seen. 

“he was look for someone else, you say—someone who was not you?” 

“he was look for little miles.” a portentous clear now possessed 
me. “_that’s_ whom he was look for.” 

“but how do you know?” 

“i know, i know, i know!” my exaltation grew. “and _you_ know, my 
dear!” 

she didn’t deny this, but i required, i felt, not even so much telling 
as that. she resume in a moment, at any rate: “what if _he_ should see 
him?” 

“little miles? that’s what he wants!” 

she look immensely scared again. “the child?” 

“heaven forbid! the man. he wants to appear to _them_.” that he might 
was an awful conception, and yet, somehow, i could keep it at bay; 
which, moreover, as we linger there, was what i succeed in 
practically proving. i had an absolute certainty that i should see 
again what i had already seen, but something within me said that by 
offering myself brave as the sole subject of such experience, by 
accepting, by inviting, by surmount it all, i should serve as an 
expiatory victim and guard the tranquil of my companions. the 
children, in especial, i should thus fence about and absolutely save. i 
recall one of the last things i said that night to mrs. grose. 

“it do strike me that my pupil have never mentioned—” 

she look at me hard as i musing pull up. “his have been here 
and the time they were with him?” 

“the time they were with him, and his name, his presence, his history, 
in any way.” 

“oh, the little lady doesn’t remember. she never heard or knew.” 

“the circumstances of his death?” i thought with some intensity. 
“perhaps not. but mile would remember—miles would know.” 

“ah, don’t try him!” broke from mrs. grose. 

i return her the look she had given me. “don’t be afraid.” i 
continue to think. “it _is_ rather odd.” 

“that he has never spoken of him?” 

“never by the least allusion. and you tell me they were ‘great 
friends’?” 

“oh, it wasn’t _him!_” mrs. grose with emphasis declared. “it was 
quint’s own fancy. to play with him, i mean—to spoil him.” she pause a 
moment; then she added: “quint was much too free.” 

this gave me, straight from my vision of his face—_such_ a face!—a 
sudden sickness of disgust. “too free with _my_ boy?” 

“too free with everyone!” 

i forbore, for the moment, to analyze this description further than by 
the reflection that a part of it applied to several of the member of 
the household, of the half-dozen maid and men who were still of our 
small colony. but there was everything, for our apprehension, in the 
lucky fact that no discomfort legend, no perturbation of scullions, 
had ever, within anyone’s memory attach to the kind old place. it had 
neither bad name nor ill fame, and mrs. grose, most apparently, only 
desire to cling to me and to quake in silence. i even put her, the 
very last thing of all, to the test. it was when, at midnight, she had 
her hand on the schoolroom door to take leave. “i have it from you 
then—for it’s of great importance—that he was definitely and admittedly 
bad?” 

“oh, not admittedly. _i_ knew it—but the master didn’t.” 

“and you never told him?” 

“well, he didn’t like tale-bearing—he hate complaints. he was terribly 
short with anything of that kind, and if people were all right to 
_him_—” 

“he wouldn’t be bother with more?” this square well enough with my 
impression of him: he was not a trouble-loving gentleman, nor so very 
particular perhaps about some of the company _he_ kept. all the same, i 
pressed my interlocutress. “i promise you _i_ would have told!” 

she felt my discrimination. “i daresay i was wrong. but, really, i was 
afraid.” 

“afraid of what?” 

“of things that man could do. quint was so clever—he was so deep.” 

i took this in still more than, probably, i showed. “you weren’t afraid 
of anything else? not of his effect—?” 

“his effect?” she repeated with a face of anguish and wait while i 
faltered. 

“on innocent little precious lives. they were in your charge.” 

“no, they were not in mine!” she roundly and distressful returned. 
“the master believe in him and placed him here because he was supposed 
not to be well and the country air so good for him. so he had 
everything to say. yes”—she let me have it—“even about _them_.” 

“them—that creature?” i had to smother a kind of howl. “and you could 
bear it!” 

“no. i couldn’t—and i can’t now!” and the poor woman burst into tears. 

a rigid control, from the next day, was, as i have said, to follow 
them; yet how often and how passionately, for a week, we came back 
together to the subject! much as we had discuss it that sunday night, 
i was, in the immediate later hour in especial—for it may be imagine 
whether i slept—still haunt with the shadow of something she had not 
told me. i myself had kept back nothing, but there was a word mrs. 
grose had kept back. i was sure, moreover, by morning, that this was 
not from a failure of frankness, but because on every side there were 
fears. it seem to me indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the 
morrow’s sun was high i had restless read into the fact before us 
almost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and more 
cruel occurrences. what they gave me above all was just the sinister 
figure of the living man—the dead one would keep awhile!—and of the 
month he had continuous pass at bly, which, add up, made a 
formidable stretch. the limit of this evil time had arrive only when, 
on the dawn of a winter’s morning, peter quint was found, by a laborer 
go to early work, stone dead on the road from the village: a 
catastrophe explained—superficially at least—by a visible wound to his 
head; such a wound as might have been produced—and as, on the final 
evidence, _had_ been—by a fatal slip, in the dark and after leave the 
public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path altogether, at 
the bottom of which he lay. the icy slope, the turn mistaken at night 
and in liquor, account for much—practically, in the end and after the 
inquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but there had been 
matter in his life—strange passage and perils, secret disorders, 
vice more than suspected—that would have account for a good deal 
more. 

i scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible 
picture of my state of mind; but i was in these days literally able to 
find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demand 
of me. i now saw that i had been ask for a service admirable and 
difficult; and there would be a great in letting it be seen—oh, in 
the right quarter!—that i could succeed where many another girl might 
have failed. it was an immense help to me—i confess i rather applaud 
myself as i look back!—that i saw my service so strong and so simply. 
i was there to protect and defend the little creature in the world the 
most bereaved and the most lovable, the appeal of whose helpless 
had sudden become only too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one’s 
own committed heart. we were cut off, really, together; we were united 
in our danger. they had nothing but me, and i—well, i had _them_. it 
was in short a magnificent chance. this chance present itself to me 
in an image richly material. i was a screen—i was to stand before them. 
the more i saw, the less they would. i began to watch them in a stifle 
suspense, a disguise excitement that might well, had it continue too 
long, have turn to something like madness. what save me, as i now 
see, was that it turn to something else altogether. it didn’t last as 
suspense—it was supersede by horrible proofs. proofs, i say, yes—from 
the moment i really took hold. 

this moment dated from an afternoon hour that i happen to spend in 
the grounds with the younger of my pupil alone. we had left mile 
indoors, on the red cushion of a deep window seat; he had wish to 
finish a book, and i had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable 
in a young man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the 
restless. his sister, on the contrary, had been alert to come out, and 
i stroll with her half an hour, seek the shade, for the sun was 
still high and the day exceptional warm. i was aware afresh, with 
her, as we went, of how, like her brother, she contrived—it was the 
charming thing in both children—to let me alone without appear to 
drop me and to accompany me without appear to surround. they were 
never importunate and yet never listless. my attention to them all 
really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me: this 
was a spectacle they seem active to prepare and that engaged me as 
an active admirer. i walk in a world of their invention—they had no 
occasion whatever to draw upon mine; so that my time was taken only 
with being, for them, some remarkable person or thing that the game of 
the moment require and that was merely, thanks to my superior, my 
exalted stamp, a happy and highly distinguished sinecure. i forget what 
i was on the present occasion; i only remember that i was something 
very important and very quiet and that flora was play very hard. we 
were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography, 
the lake was the sea of azof. 

suddenly, in these circumstances, i became aware that, on the other 
side of the sea of azof, we had an interested spectator. the way this 
knowledge gather in me was the strangest thing in the world—the 
strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it quick 
merge itself. i had sat down with a piece of work—for i was something 
or other that could sit—on the old stone bench which overlook the 
pond; and in this position i began to take in with certitude, and yet 
without direct vision, the presence, at a distance, of a third person. 
the old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade, 
but it was all suffuse with the bright of the hot, still hour. 
there was no ambiguous in anything; none whatever, at least, in the 
conviction i from one moment to another found myself form as to what 
i should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of 
raise my eyes. they were attach at this juncture to the stitch 
in which i was engaged, and i can feel once more the spasm of my effort 
not to move them till i should so have steady myself as to be able to 
make up my mind what to do. there was an alien object in view—a figure 
whose right of presence i instantly, passionately questioned. i 
recollect count over perfectly the possibilities, remind myself 
that nothing was more natural, for instance, then the appearance of one 
of the men about the place, or even of a messenger, a postman, or a 
tradesman’s boy, from the village. that reminder had as little effect 
on my practical certitude as i was conscious—still even without 
looking—of its have upon the character and attitude of our visitor. 
nothing was more natural than that these things should be the other 
things that they absolutely were not. 

of the positive identity of the apparition i would assure myself as 
soon as the small clock of my courage should have tick out the right 
second; meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, i 
transfer my eyes straight to little flora, who, at the moment, was 
about ten yard away. my heart had stood still for an instant with the 
wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see; and i held 
my breath while i wait for what a cry from her, what some sudden 
innocent sign either of interest or of alarm, would tell me. i waited, 
but nothing came; then, in the first place—and there is something more 
dire in this, i feel, than in anything i have to relate—i was 
determined by a sense that, within a minute, all sound from her had 
previous dropped; and, in the second, by the circumstance that, also 
within the minute, she had, in her play, turn her back to the water. 
this was her attitude when i at last look at her—looked with the 
confirmed conviction that we were still, together, under direct 
personal notice. she had picked up a small flat piece of wood, which 
happen to have in it a little hole that had evidently suggest to 
her the idea of stick in another fragment that might figure as a 
mast and make the thing a boat. this second morsel, as i watch her, 
she was very marked and intent attempt to tighten in its place. 
my apprehension of what she was do sustain me so that after some 
seconds i felt i was ready for more. then i again shift my eyes—i 
face what i had to face. 


vii 

i got hold of mrs. grose as soon after this as i could; and i can give 
no intelligible account of how i fought out the interval. yet i still 
hear myself cry as i fairly threw myself into her arms: “they 
_know_—it’s too monstrous: they know, they know!” 

“and what on earth—?” i felt her incredulity as she held me. 

“why, all that _we_ know—and heaven know what else besides!” then, as 
she release me, i made it out to her, made it out perhaps only now 
with full coherent even to myself. “two hour ago, in the garden”—i 
could scarce articulate—“flora _saw!_” 

mrs. grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the stomach. “she 
has told you?” she panted. 

“not a word—that’s the horror. she kept it to herself! the child of 
eight, _that_ child!” unutterable still, for me, was the stupefaction 
of it. 

mrs. grose, of course, could only gape the wider. “then how do you 
know?” 

“i was there—i saw with my eyes: saw that she was perfectly aware.” 

“do you mean aware of _him?_” 

“no—of _her_.” i was conscious as i spoke that i look prodigious 
things, for i got the slow reflection of them in my companion’s face. 
“another person—this time; but a figure of quite as unmistakable horror 
and evil: a woman in black, pale and dreadful—with such an air also, 
and such a face!—on the other side of the lake. i was there with the 
child—quiet for the hour; and in the midst of it she came.” 

“came how—from where?” 

“from where they come from! she just appear and stood there—but not 
so near.” 

“and without coming nearer?” 

“oh, for the effect and the feeling, she might have been as close as 
you!” 

my friend, with an odd impulse, fell back a step. “was she someone 
you’ve never seen?” 

“yes. but someone the child has. someone _you_ have.” then, to show how 
i had thought it all out: “my predecessor—the one who died.” 

“miss jessel?” 

“miss jessel. you don’t believe me?” i pressed. 

she turn right and left in her distress. “how can you be sure?” 

this drew from me, in the state of my nerves, a flash of impatience. 
“then ask flora—_she’s_ sure!” but i had no soon spoken than i caught 
myself up. “no, for god’s sake, _don’t!_ she’ll say she isn’t—she’ll 
lie!” 

mrs. grose was not too bewilder instinctive to protest. “ah, how 
_can_ you?” 

“because i’m clear. flora doesn’t want me to know.” 

“it’s only then to spare you.” 

“no, no—there are depths, depths! the more i go over it, the more i see 
in it, and the more i see in it, the more i fear. i don’t know what i 
_don’t_ see—what i _don’t_ fear!” 

mrs. grose try to keep up with me. “you mean you’re afraid of seeing 
her again?” 

“oh, no; that’s nothing—now!” then i explained. “it’s of _not_ seeing 
her.” 

but my companion only look wan. “i don’t understand you.” 

“why, it’s that the child may keep it up—and that the child assured 
_will_—without my knowing it.” 

at the image of this possibility mrs. grose for a moment collapsed, yet 
presently to pull herself together again, as if from the positive force 
of the sense of what, should we yield an inch, there would really be to 
give way to. “dear, dear—we must keep our heads! and after all, if she 
doesn’t mind it—!” she even try a grim joke. “perhaps she likes it!” 

“likes _such_ things—a scrap of an infant!” 

“isn’t it just a proof of her blessed innocence?” my friend brave 
inquired. 

she brought me, for the instant, almost round. “oh, we must clutch at 
_that_—we must cling to it! if it isn’t a proof of what you say, it’s a 
proof of—god know what! for the woman’s a horror of horrors.” 

mrs. grose, at this, fixed her eyes a minute on the ground; then at 
last raise them, “tell me how you know,” she said. 

“then you admit it’s what she was?” i cried. 

“tell me how you know,” my friend simply repeated. 

“know? by seeing her! by the way she looked.” 

“at you, do you mean—so wickedly?” 

“dear me, no—i could have borne that. she gave me never a glance. she 
only fixed the child.” 

mrs. grose try to see it. “fixed her?” 

“ah, with such awful eyes!” 

she stare at mine as if they might really have resemble them. “do you 
mean of dislike?” 

“god help us, no. of something much worse.” 

“worse than dislike?”—this left her indeed at a loss. 

“with a determination—indescribable. with a kind of fury of intention.” 

i made her turn pale. “intention?” 

“to get hold of her.” mrs. grose—her eyes just lingering on mine—gave a 
shudder and walk to the window; and while she stood there look out 
i complete my statement. “_that’s_ what flora knows.” 

after a little she turn round. “the person was in black, you say?” 

“in mourning—rather poor, almost shabby. but—yes—with extraordinary 
beauty.” i now recognize to what i had at last, stroke by stroke, 
brought the victim of my confidence, for she quite visibly weigh 
this. “oh, handsome—very, very,” i insisted; “wonderfully handsome. but 
infamous.” 

she slow came back to me. “miss jessel—_was_ infamous.” she once more 
took my hand in both her own, holding it as tight as if to fortify me 
against the increase of alarm i might draw from this disclosure. “they 
were both infamous,” she finally said. 

so, for a little, we face it once more together; and i found 
absolutely a degree of help in seeing it now so straight. “i 
appreciate,” i said, “the great decency of your not have hitherto 
spoken; but the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing.” 
she appear to assent to this, but still only in silence; seeing which 
i went on: “i must have it now. of what did she die? come, there was 
something between them.” 

“there was everything.” 

“in spite of the difference—?” 

“oh, of their rank, their condition”—she brought it woeful out. 
“_she_ was a lady.” 

i turn it over; i again saw. “yes—she was a lady.” 

“and he so dreadfully below,” said mrs. grose. 

i felt that i doubtless needn’t press too hard, in such company, on the 
place of a servant in the scale; but there was nothing to prevent an 
acceptance of my companion’s own measure of my predecessor’s abasement. 
there was a way to deal with that, and i dealt; the more readily for my 
full vision—on the evidence—of our employer’s late clever, good-looking 
“own” man; impudent, assured, spoiled, depraved. “the fellow was a 
hound.” 

mrs. grose considered as if it were perhaps a little a case for a sense 
of shades. “i’ve never seen one like him. he did what he wished.” 

“with _her?_” 

“with them all.” 

it was as if now in my friend’s own eyes miss jessel had again 
appeared. i seem at any rate, for an instant, to see their evocation 
of her as distinct as i had seen her by the pond; and i brought out 
with decision: “it must have been also what _she_ wished!” 

mrs. grose’s face signify that it had been indeed, but she said at 
the same time: “poor woman—she paid for it!” 

“then you do know what she die of?” i asked. 

“no—i know nothing. i want not to know; i was glad enough i didn’t; 
and i thank heaven she was well out of this!” 

“yet you had, then, your idea—” 

“of her real reason for leaving? oh, yes—as to that. she couldn’t have 
stayed. fancy it here—for a governess! and afterward i imagined—and i 
still imagine. and what i imagine is dreadful.” 

“not so dreadful as what _i_ do,” i replied; on which i must have shown 
her—as i was indeed but too conscious—a front of miserable defeat. it 
brought out again all her compassion for me, and at the renew touch 
of her kindness my power to resist broke down. i burst, as i had, the 
other time, made her burst, into tears; she took me to her motherly 
breast, and my lamentation overflowed. “i don’t do it!” i sob in 
despair; “i don’t save or shield them! it’s far worse than i 
dreamed—they’re lost!” 


viii 

what i had said to mrs. grose was true enough: there were in the matter 
i had put before her depths and possibility that i lack resolution 
to sound; so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of 
a common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies. we 
were to keep our head if we should keep nothing else—difficult indeed 
as that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was 
least to be questioned. late that night, while the house slept, we had 
another talk in my room, when she went all the way with me as to its 
being beyond doubt that i had seen exactly what i had seen. to hold her 
perfectly in the pinch of that, i found i had only to ask her how, if i 
had “made it up,” i came to be able to give, of each of the person 
appear to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their 
special marks—a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly 
recognize and name them. she wish of course—small blame to her!—to 
sink the whole subject; and i was quick to assure her that my own 
interest in it had now violent taken the form of a search for the way 
to escape from it. i encounter her on the ground of a probability 
that with recurrence—for recurrence we took for granted—i should get 
use to my danger, distinct profess that my personal exposure had 
sudden become the least of my discomforts. it was my new suspicion 
that was intolerable; and yet even to this complication the later hour 
of the day had brought a little ease. 

on leave her, after my first outbreak, i had of course return to my 
pupils, associate the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of 
their charm which i had already found to be a thing i could positively 
cultivate and which had never fail me yet. i had simply, in other 
words, plunge afresh into flora’s special society and there become 
aware—it was almost a luxury!—that she could put her little conscious 
hand straight upon the spot that ached. she had look at me in sweet 
speculation and then had accused me to my face of have “cried.” i had 
supposed i had brush away the ugly signs: but i could literally—for 
the time, at all events—rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that 
they had not entire disappeared. to gaze into the depths of blue of 
the child’s eyes and pronounce their lovely a trick of premature 
cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which i 
naturally prefer to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my 
agitation. i couldn’t abjure for merely wanting to, but i could repeat 
to mrs. grose—as i did there, over and over, in the small hours—that 
with their voice in the air, their pressure on one’s heart, and their 
fragrant face against one’s cheek, everything fell to the ground but 
their incapacity and their beauty. it was a pity that, somehow, to 
settle this once for all, i had equally to re-enumerate the sign of 
subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of my 
show of self-possession. it was a pity to be oblige to reinvestigate 
the certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as 
a revelation that the inconceivable communion i then surprise was a 
matter, for either party, of habit. it was a pity that i should have 
had to quaver out again the reason for my not having, in my delusion, 
so much as question that the little girl saw our visitant even as i 
actually saw mrs. grose herself, and that she wanted, by just so much 
as she did thus see, to make me suppose she didn’t, and at the same 
time, without showing anything, arrive at a guess as to whether i 
myself did! it was a pity that i need once more to describe the 
portentous little activity by which she sought to divert my 
attention—the perceptible increase of movement, the greater intensity 
of play, the singing, the gabble of nonsense, and the invitation to 
romp. 

yet if i had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this 
review, i should have miss the two or three dim elements of comfort 
that still remain to me. i should not for instance have been able to 
asseverate to my friend that i was certain—which was so much to the 
good—that _i_ at least had not betray myself. i should not have been 
prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind—i scarce know what 
to call it—to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring 
from push my colleague fairly to the wall. she had told me, bit by 
bit, under pressure, a great deal; but a small shifty spot on the wrong 
side of it all still sometimes brush my brow like the wing of a bat; 
and i remember how on this occasion—for the sleep house and the 
concentration alike of our danger and our watch seem to help—i felt 
the importance of give the last jerk to the curtain. “i don’t believe 
anything so horrible,” i recollect saying; “no, let us put it 
definitely, my dear, that i don’t. but if i did, you know, there’s a 
thing i should require now, just without sparing you the least bit 
more—oh, not a scrap, come!—to get out of you. what was it you had in 
mind when, in our distress, before mile came back, over the letter 
from his school, you said, under my insistence, that you didn’t pretend 
for him that he had not literally _ever_ been ‘bad’? he has _not_ 
literally ‘ever,’ in these week that i myself have live with him and 
so close watch him; he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of 
delightful, lovable goodness. therefore you might perfectly have made 
the claim for him if you had not, as it happened, seen an exception to 
take. what was your exception, and to what passage in your personal 
observation of him did you refer?” 

it was a dreadfully austere inquiry, but levity was not our note, and, 
at any rate, before the gray dawn admonish us to separate i had got 
my answer. what my friend had had in mind prove to be immensely to the 
purpose. it was neither more nor less than the circumstance that for a 
period of several month quint and the boy had been perpetual 
together. it was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had 
venture to criticize the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of so 
close an alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank 
overture to miss jessel. miss jessel had, with a most strange manner, 
request her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this, 
directly approach little miles. what she had said to him, since i 
pressed, was that _she_ like to see young gentlemen not forget their 
station. 

i pressed again, of course, at this. “you remind him that quint was 
only a base menial?” 

“as you might say! and it was his answer, for one thing, that was bad.” 

“and for another thing?” i waited. “he repeated your words to quint?” 

“no, not that. it’s just what he _wouldn’t!_” she could still impress 
upon me. “i was sure, at any rate,” she added, “that he didn’t. but he 
deny certain occasions.” 

“what occasions?” 

“when they had been about together quite as if quint were his tutor—and 
a very grand one—and miss jessel only for the little lady. when he had 
gone off with the fellow, i mean, and spent hour with him.” 

“he then prevaricate about it—he said he hadn’t?” her assent was clear 
enough to cause me to add in a moment: “i see. he lied.” 

“oh!” mrs. grose mumbled. this was a suggestion that it didn’t matter; 
which indeed she back up by a further remark. “you see, after all, 
miss jessel didn’t mind. she didn’t forbid him.” 

i considered. “did he put that to you as a justification?” 

at this she drop again. “no, he never spoke of it.” 

“never mention her in connection with quint?” 

she saw, visibly flushing, where i was coming out. “well, he didn’t 
show anything. he denied,” she repeated; “he denied.” 

lord, how i pressed her now! “so that you could see he knew what was 
between the two wretches?” 

“i don’t know—i don’t know!” the poor woman groaned. 

“you do know, you dear thing,” i replied; “only you haven’t my dreadful 
bold of mind, and you keep back, out of timid and modesty and 
delicacy, even the impression that, in the past, when you had, without 
my aid, to flounder about in silence, most of all made you miserable. 
but i shall get it out of you yet! there was something in the boy that 
suggest to you,” i continued, “that he cover and conceal their 
relation.” 

“oh, he couldn’t prevent—” 

“your learning the truth? i daresay! but, heavens,” i fell, with 
vehemence, athinking, “what it show that they must, to that extent, 
have succeed in making of him!” 

“ah, nothing that’s not nice _now!_” mrs. grose lugubrious pleaded. 

“i don’t wonder you look queer,” i persisted, “when i mention to 
you the letter from his school!” 

“i doubt if i look as queer as you!” she retort with homely force. 
“and if he was so bad then as that come to, how is he such an angel 
now?” 

“yes, indeed—and if he was a fiend at school! how, how, how? well,” i 
said in my torment, “you must put it to me again, but i shall not be 
able to tell you for some days. only, put it to me again!” i cry in a 
way that made my friend stare. “there are directions in which i must 
not for the present let myself go.” meanwhile i return to her first 
example—the one to which she had just previous referred—of the boy’s 
happy capacity for an occasional slip. “if quint—on your remonstrance 
at the time you speak of—was a base menial, one of the things mile 
said to you, i find myself guessing, was that you were another.” again 
her admission was so adequate that i continued: “and you forgave him 
that?” 

“wouldn’t _you?_” 

“oh, yes!” and we exchange there, in the stillness, a sound of the 
oddest amusement. then i went on: “at all events, while he was with the 
man—” 

“miss flora was with the woman. it suit them all!” 

it suit me, too, i felt, only too well; by which i mean that it 
suit exactly the particularly deadly view i was in the very act of 
forbidding myself to entertain. but i so far succeed in check the 
expression of this view that i will throw, just here, no further light 
on it than may be offer by the mention of my final observation to 
mrs. grose. “his have lie and been impudent are, i confess, less 
engaging specimen than i had hope to have from you of the outbreak in 
him of the little natural man. still,” i mused, “they must do, for they 
make me feel more than ever that i must watch.” 

it made me blush, the next minute, to see in my friend’s face how much 
more unreserved she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as 
present to my own tender an occasion for doing. this came out 
when, at the schoolroom door, she quit me. “surely you don’t accuse 
_him_—” 

“of carry on an intercourse that he conceal from me? ah, remember 
that, until further evidence, i now accuse nobody.” then, before 
shut her out to go, by another passage, to her own place, “i must 
just wait,” i wound up. 


ix 

i wait and waited, and the days, as they elapsed, took something from 
my consternation. a very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant 
sight of my pupils, without a fresh incident, suffice to give to 
grievous fancies and even to odious memory a kind of brush of the 
sponge. i have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish 
grace as a thing i could active cultivate, and it may be imagine if 
i neglect now to address myself to this source for whatever it would 
yield. stranger than i can express, certainly, was the effort to 
struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however, 
a greater tension still had it not been so frequent successful. i 
use to wonder how my little charge could help guess that i thought 
strange things about them; and the circumstances that these things only 
made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping 
them in the dark. i tremble lest they should see that they _were_ so 
immensely more interesting. putt things at the worst, at all events, 
as in meditation i so often did, any cloud of their innocence could 
only be—blameless and foredoomed as they were—a reason the more for 
taking risks. there were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, i 
found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart. as soon as 
i had done so i use to say to myself: “what will they think of that? 
doesn’t it betray too much?” it would have been easy to get into a sad, 
wild tangle about how much i might betray; but the real account, i 
feel, of the hour of peace that i could still enjoy was that the 
immediate charm of my companion was a beguile still effective even 
under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied. for if it 
occur to me that i might occasional excite suspicion by the little 
outbreak of my sharper passion for them, so too i remember wonder 
if i mightn’t see a queer in the trace increase of their own 
demonstrations. 

they were at this period extravagant and preternatural fond of me; 
which, after all, i could reflect, was no more than a graceful response 
in children perpetual bowed over and hugged. the homage of which they 
were so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if 
i never appear to myself, as i may say, literally to catch them at a 
purpose in it. they had never, i think, want to do so many things for 
their poor protectress; i mean—though they got their lesson better and 
better, which was naturally what would please her most—in the way of 
diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling 
her stories, acting her charades, pounce out at her, in disguises, as 
animal and historical characters, and above all astonish her by the 
“pieces” they had secret got by heart and could interminable recite. 
i should never get to the bottom—were i to let myself go even now—of 
the prodigious private commentary, all under still more private 
correction, with which, in these days, i overscore their full hours. 
they had shown me from the first a facility for everything, a general 
faculty which, taking a fresh start, achieve remarkable flights. they 
got their little task as if they love them, and indulged, from the 
mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little miracle of 
memory. they not only pop out at me as tiger and as romans, but as 
shakespeareans, astronomers, and navigators. this was so singularly the 
case that it had presumable much to do with the fact as to which, at 
the present day, i am at a loss for a different explanation: i allude 
to my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for miles. 
what i remember is that i was content not, for the time, to open the 
question, and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his 
perpetual striking show of cleverness. he was too clever for a bad 
governess, for a parson’s daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if not 
the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery i just spoke of was the 
impression i might have got, if i had dare to work it out, that he was 
under some influence operate in his small intellectual life as a 
tremendous incitement. 

if it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone 
school, it was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been 
“kicked out” by a schoolmaster was a mystification without end. let me 
add that in their company now—and i was careful almost never to be out 
of it—i could follow no scent very far. we live in a cloud of music 
and love and success and private theatricals. the musical sense in each 
of the children was of the quickest, but the elder in especial had a 
marvelous knack of catching and repeating. the schoolroom piano broke 
into all gruesome fancies; and when that fail there were 
confabulation in corners, with a sequel of one of them go out in 
the highest spirits in order to “come in” as something new. i had had 
brother myself, and it was no revelation to me that little girl could 
be slavish idolater of little boys. what surpass everything was that 
there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior 
age, sex, and intelligence so fine a consideration. they were 
extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never either quarrel or 
complain is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of 
sweetness. sometimes, indeed, when i drop into coarseness, i perhaps 
came across trace of little understanding between them by which one 
of them should keep me occupy while the other slip away. there is 
a _naïf_ side, i suppose, in all diplomacy; but if my pupil practiced 
upon me, it was surely with the minimum of grossness. it was all in the 
other quarter that, after a lull, the gross broke out. 

i find that i really hang back; but i must take my plunge. in go on 
with the record of what was hideous at bly, i not only challenge the 
most liberal faith—for which i little care; but—and this is another 
matter—i renew what i myself suffered, i again push my way through it 
to the end. there came sudden an hour after which, as i look back, 
the affair seem to me to have been all pure suffering; but i have at 
least reach the heart of it, and the straightest road out is 
doubtless to advance. one evening—with nothing to lead up or to prepare 
it—i felt the cold touch of the impression that had breathe on me the 
night of my arrival and which, much lighter then, as i have mentioned, 
i should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent 
sojourn been less agitated. i had not gone to bed; i sat reading by a 
couple of candles. there was a roomful of old books at bly—last-century 
fiction, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinct deprecate 
renown, but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had reach 
the sequester home and appeal to the unavowed curiosity of my 
youth. i remember that the book i had in my hand was fielding’s 
_amelia_; also that i was wholly awake. i recall further both a general 
conviction that it was horrible late and a particular objection to 
look at my watch. i figure, finally, that the white curtain draping, 
in the fashion of those days, the head of flora’s little bed, shrouded, 
as i had assured myself long before, the perfection of childish rest. i 
recollect in short that, though i was deep interested in my author, i 
found myself, at the turn of a page and with his spell all scattered, 
look straight up from him and hard at the door of my room. there was 
a moment during which i listened, remind of the faint sense i had 
had, the first night, of there being something undefinable astir in the 
house, and noted the soft breath of the open case just move the 
half-drawn blind. then, with all the mark of a deliberation that must 
have seem magnificent had there been anyone to admire it, i laid down 
my book, rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of 
the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little 
impression, noiseless closed and lock the door. 

i can say now neither what determined nor what guide me, but i went 
straight along the lobby, holding my candle high, till i came within 
sight of the tall window that preside over the great turn of the 
staircase. at this point i precipitate found myself aware of three 
things. they were practically simultaneous, yet they had flash of 
succession. my candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and i 
perceived, by the uncover window, that the yielding dusk of earliest 
morning render it unnecessary. without it, the next instant, i saw 
that there was someone on the stair. i speak of sequences, but i 
require no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter 
with quint. the apparition had reach the landing halfway up and was 
therefore on the spot nearest the window, where at sight of me, it 
stop short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower 
and from the garden. he knew me as well as i knew him; and so, in the 
cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on 
the polish of the oak stair below, we face each other in our common 
intensity. he was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable, 
dangerous presence. but that was not the wonder of wonders; i reserve 
this distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that 
dread had unmistakable quit me and that there was nothing in me 
there that didn’t meet and measure him. 

i had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but i had, 
thank god, no terror. and he knew i had not—i found myself at the end 
of an instant magnificent aware of this. i felt, in a fierce rigor of 
confidence, that if i stood my ground a minute i should cease—for the 
time, at least—to have him to reckon with; and during the minute, 
accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview: 
hideous just because it _was_ human, as human as to have met alone, in 
the small hours, in a sleep house, some enemy, some adventurer, some 
criminal. it was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close 
quarters that gave the whole horror, huge as it was, its only note of 
the unnatural. if i had met a murder in such a place and at such an 
hour, we still at least would have spoken. something would have passed, 
in life, between us; if nothing had passed, one of us would have moved. 
the moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to 
make me doubt if even _i_ were in life. i can’t express what follow 
it save by saying that the silence itself—which was indeed in a manner 
an attestation of my strength—became the element into which i saw the 
figure disappear; in which i definitely saw it turn as i might have 
seen the low wretch to which it had once belong turn on receipt of an 
order, and pass, with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch 
could have more disfigured, straight down the staircase and into the 
dark in which the next bend was lost. 


x 

i remain awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect 
presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: 
then i return to my room. the foremost thing i saw there by the light 
of the candle i had left burning was that flora’s little bed was empty; 
and on this i caught my breath with all the terror that, five minutes 
before, i had been able to resist. i dashed at the place in which i had 
left her lie and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the 
sheet were disarranged) the white curtains had been deceiving pull 
forward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, produce an answer 
sound: i perceive an agitation of the window blind, and the child, 
duck down, emerge rosy from the other side of it. she stood there 
in so much of her candor and so little of her nightgown, with her pink 
bare feet and the golden glow of her curls. she look intense grave, 
and i had never had such a sense of lose an advantage acquire (the 
thrill of which had just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness 
that she address me with a reproach. “you naughty: where _have_ you 
been?”—instead of challenging her own irregularity i found myself 
arraign and explaining. she herself explained, for that matter, with 
the loveliest, eagerest simplicity. she had known suddenly, as she lay 
there, that i was out of the room, and had jump up to see what had 
become of me. i had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back 
into my chair—feeling then, and then only, a little faint; and she had 
patter straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee, given 
herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful 
little face that was still flushed with sleep. i remember close my 
eyes an instant, yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of 
something beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own. “you were 
look for me out of the window?” i said. “you thought i might be 
walking in the grounds?” 

“well, you know, i thought someone was”—she never blanch as she 
smile out that at me. 

oh, how i look at her now! “and did you see anyone?” 

“ah, _no!_” she returned, almost with the full privilege of childish 
inconsequence, resentfully, though with a long sweet in her little 
drawl of the negative. 

at that moment, in the state of my nerves, i absolutely believe she 
lied; and if i once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the 
three or four possible ways in which i might take this up. one of 
these, for a moment, tempt me with such singular intensity that, to 
withstand it, i must have grip my little girl with a spasm that, 
wonderfully, she submit to without a cry or a sign of fright. why 
not break out at her on the spot and have it all over?—give it to her 
straight in her lovely little light face? “you see, you see, you 
_know_ that you do and that you already quite suspect i believe it; 
therefore, why not frankly confess it to me, so that we may at least 
live with it together and learn perhaps, in the strange of our 
fate, where we are and what it means?” this solicit dropped, alas, 
as it came: if i could immediately have succumb to it i might have 
spare myself—well, you’ll see what. instead of succumb i sprang 
again to my feet, look at her bed, and took a helpless middle way. 
“why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were 
still there?” 

flora luminous considered; after which, with her little divine smile: 
“because i don’t like to frighten you!” 

“but if i had, by your idea, gone out—?” 

she absolutely decline to be puzzled; she turn her eyes to the flame 
of the candle as if the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as 
impersonal, as mrs. marcet or nine-times-nine. “oh, but you know,” she 
quite adequate answered, “that you might come back, you dear, and 
that you _have!_” and after a little, when she had got into bed, i had, 
for a long time, by almost sitting on her to hold her hand, to prove 
that i recognize the pertinence of my return. 

you may imagine the general complexion, from that moment, of my nights. 
i repeatedly sat up till i didn’t know when; i select moments when my 
roommate unmistakable slept, and, steal out, took noiseless turn in 
the passage and even pushed as far as to where i had last met quint. 
but i never met him there again; and i may as well say at once that i 
on no other occasion saw him in the house. i just missed, on the 
staircase, on the other hand, a different adventure. look down it 
from the top i once recognize the presence of a woman seat on one of 
the lower steps with her back present to me, her body half-bowed and 
her head, in an attitude of woe, in her hands. i had been there but an 
instant, however, when she vanish without look round at me. i 
knew, nonetheless, exactly what dreadful face she had to show; and i 
wonder whether, if instead of being above i had been below, i should 
have had, for go up, the same nerve i had lately shown quint. well, 
there continue to be plenty of chance for nerve. on the eleventh night 
after my latest encounter with that gentleman—they were all number 
now—i had an alarm that perilous skirt it and that indeed, from the 
particular quality of its unexpectedness, prove quite my sharpest 
shock. it was precisely the first night during this series that, weary 
with watching, i had felt that i might again without laxity lay myself 
down at my old hour. i slept immediately and, as i afterward knew, till 
about one o’clock; but when i woke it was to sit straight up, as 
completely rouse as if a hand had shook me. i had left a light 
burning, but it was now out, and i felt an instant certainty that flora 
had extinguish it. this brought me to my feet and straight, in the 
darkness, to her bed, which i found she had left. a glance at the 
window enlightened me further, and the striking of a match complete 
the picture. 

the child had again got up—this time blow out the taper, and had 
again, for some purpose of observation or response, squeeze in behind 
the blind and was peer out into the night. that she now saw—as she 
had not, i had satisfy myself, the previous time—was prove to me by 
the fact that she was disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the 
haste i made to get into slipper and into a wrap. hidden, protected, 
absorbed, she evidently rest on the sill—the case open 
forward—and gave herself up. there was a great still moon to help her, 
and this fact had count in my quick decision. she was face to face 
with the apparition we had met at the lake, and could now communicate 
with it as she had not then been able to do. what i, on my side, had to 
care for was, without disturb her, to reach, from the corridor, some 
other window in the same quarter. i got to the door without her hearing 
me; i got out of it, closed it, and listened, from the other side, for 
some sound from her. while i stood in the passage i had my eyes on her 
brother’s door, which was but ten steps off and which, indescribably, 
produce in me a renewal of the strange impulse that i lately spoke of 
as my temptation. what if i should go straight in and march to _his_ 
window?—what if, by risk to his boyish bewilder a revelation of 
my motive, i should throw across the rest of the mystery the long 
halter of my boldness? 

this thought held me sufficient to make me cross to his threshold and 
pause again. i preternatural listened; i figured to myself what might 
portentous be; i wonder if his bed were also empty and he too were 
secret at watch. it was a deep, soundless minute, at the end of which 
my impulse failed. he was quiet; he might be innocent; the risk was 
hideous; i turn away. there was a figure in the grounds—a figure 
prowl for a sight, the visitor with whom flora was engaged; but it 
was not the visitor most concerned with my boy. i hesitate afresh, but 
on other grounds and only for a few seconds; then i had made my choice. 
there were empty rooms at bly, and it was only a question of choose 
the right one. the right one sudden present itself to me as the 
lower one—though high above the gardens—in the solid corner of the 
house that i have spoken of as the old tower. this was a large, square 
chamber, arrange with some state as a bedroom, the extravagant size of 
which made it so inconvenient that it had not for years, though kept by 
mrs. grose in exemplary order, been occupied. i had often admire it 
and i knew my way about in it; i had only, after just falter at the 
first chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it and unbolt as 
quiet as i could one of the shutters. achieve this transit, i 
uncover the glass without a sound and, apply my face to the pane, 
was able, the dark without being much less than within, to see that 
i command the right direction. then i saw something more. the moon 
made the night extraordinarily penetrate and show me on the lawn a 
person, diminish by distance, who stood there motionless and as if 
fascinated, look up to where i had appeared—looking, that is, not so 
much straight at me as at something that was apparently above me. there 
was clearly another person above me—there was a person on the tower; 
but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what i had conceive 
and had confident hurried to meet. the presence on the lawn—i felt 
sick as i made it out—was poor little mile himself.

it was not till late next day that i spoke to mrs. grose; the rigor 
with which i kept my pupil in sight making it often difficult to meet 
her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance of not 
provoking—on the part of the servant quite as much as on that of the 
children—any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of 
mysteries. i drew a great security in this particular from her mere 
smooth aspect. there was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to other 
my horrible confidences. she believe me, i was sure, absolutely: if 
she hadn’t i don’t know what would have become of me, for i couldn’t 
have borne the business alone. but she was a magnificent monument to 
the blessing of a want of imagination, and if she could see in our 
little charge nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness 
and cleverness, she had no direct communication with the source of my 
trouble. if they had been at all visibly blight or battered, she 
would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back, haggard enough to match 
them; as matter stood, however, i could feel her, when she survey 
them, with her large white arms fold and the habit of serene in all 
her look, thank the lord’s mercy that if they were ruin the pieces 
would still serve. flight of fancy gave place, in her mind, to a 
steady fireside glow, and i had already begun to perceive how, with the 
development of the conviction that—as time went on without a public 
accident—our young things could, after all, look out for themselves, 
she address her greatest solicitude to the sad case present by 
their instructress. that, for myself, was a sound simplification: i 
could engage that, to the world, my face should tell no tales, but it 
would have been, in the conditions, an immense add strain to find 
myself anxious about hers. 

at the hour i now speak of she had join me, under pressure, on the 
terrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the afternoon sun was now 
agreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance, 
but within call if we wished, the children stroll to and fro in one 
of their most manageable moods. they move slowly, in unison, below us, 
over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook 
and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. mrs. 
grose watch them with positive placidity; then i caught the 
suppress intellectual creak with which she conscientious turn to 
take from me a view of the back of the tapestry. i had made her a 
receptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my 
superiority—my accomplishment and my function—in her patience under my 
pain. she offer her mind to my disclosure as, had i wish to mix a 
witch’s broth and propose it with assurance, she would have held out a 
large clean saucepan. this had become thorough her attitude by the 
time that, in my recital of the event of the night, i reach the 
point of what mile had said to me when, after seeing him, at such a 
monstrous hour, almost on the very spot where he happen now to be, i 
had gone down to bring him in; choose then, at the window, with a 
concentrated need of not alarm the house, rather that method than a 
signal more resonant. i had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my 
small hope of represent with success even to her actual sympathy my 
sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after 
i had got him into the house, the boy met my final articulate 
challenge. as soon as i appear in the moonlight on the terrace, he 
had come to me as straight as possible; on which i had taken his hand 
without a word and led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase 
where quint had so hungry hover for him, along the lobby where i 
had listen and trembled, and so to his forsaken room. 

not a sound, on the way, had pass between us, and i had wondered—oh, 
_how_ i had wondered!—if he were grope about in his little mind for 
something plausible and not too grotesque. it would tax his invention, 
certainly, and i felt, this time, over his real embarrassment, a 
curious thrill of triumph. it was a sharp trap for the inscrutable! he 
couldn’t play any long at innocence; so how the deuce would he get 
out of it? there beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb of this 
question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce _i_ should. i was 
confront at last, as never yet, with all the risk attach even now 
to sound my own horrid note. i remember in fact that as we pushed 
into his little chamber, where the bed had not been slept in at all and 
the window, uncover to the moonlight, made the place so clear that 
there was no need of striking a match—i remember how i sudden 
dropped, sank upon the edge of the bed from the force of the idea that 
he must know how he really, as they say, “had” me. he could do what he 
liked, with all his clever to help him, so long as i should 
continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminal of those 
caretaker of the young who minister to superstition and fears. he 
“had” me indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve me, 
who would consent that i should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor 
of an overture, i were the first to introduce into our perfect 
intercourse an element so dire? no, no: it was useless to attempt to 
convey to mrs. grose, just as it is scarcely less so to attempt to 
suggest here, how, in our short, stiff brush in the dark, he fairly 
shook me with admiration. i was of course thorough kind and merciful; 
never, never yet had i placed on his little shoulder hand of such 
tender as those with which, while i rest against the bed, i held 
him there well under fire. i had no alternative but, in form at least, 
to put it to him. 

“you must tell me now—and all the truth. what did you go out for? what 
were you do there?” 

i can still see his wonderful smile, the whites of his beautiful eyes, 
and the uncover of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk. “if i 
tell you why, will you understand?” my heart, at this, leap into my 
mouth. _would_ he tell me why? i found no sound on my lip to press it, 
and i was aware of reply only with a vague, repeated, grimace nod. 
he was gentle itself, and while i wag my head at him he stood 
there more than ever a little fairy prince. it was his bright 
indeed that gave me a respite. would it be so great if he were really 
go to tell me? “well,” he said at last, “just exactly in order that 
you should do this.” 

“do what?” 

“think me—for a change—_bad!_” i shall never forget the sweet and 
gaiety with which he brought out the word, nor how, on top of it, he 
bent forward and kiss me. it was practically the end of everything. i 
met his kiss and i had to make, while i fold him for a minute in my 
arms, the most stupendous effort not to cry. he had given exactly the 
account of himself that permit least of my go behind it, and it 
was only with the effect of confirm my acceptance of it that, as i 
presently glance about the room, i could say— 

“then you didn’t undress at all?” 

he fairly glitter in the gloom. “not at all. i sat up and read.” 

“and when did you go down?” 

“at midnight. when i’m bad i _am_ bad!” 

“i see, i see—it’s charming. but how could you be sure i would know 
it?” 

“oh, i arrange that with flora.” his answer rang out with a 
readiness! “she was to get up and look out.” 

“which is what she did do.” it was i who fell into the trap! 

“so she disturbed you, and, to see what she was look at, you also 
looked—you saw.” 

“while you,” i concurred, “caught your death in the night air!” 

he literally bloom so from this exploit that he could afford 
radiant to assent. “how otherwise should i have been bad enough?” he 
asked. then, after another embrace, the incident and our interview 
closed on my recognition of all the reserve of goodness that, for his 
joke, he had been able to draw upon. 


xii 

the particular impression i had received prove in the morning light, i 
repeat, not quite successful presentable to mrs. grose, though i 
reinforce it with the mention of still another remark that he had made 
before we separated. “it all lie in half a dozen words,” i said to 
her, “words that really settle the matter. ‘think, you know, what i 
_might_ do!’ he threw that off to show me how good he is. he know down 
to the ground what he ‘might’ do. that’s what he gave them a taste of 
at school.” 

“lord, you do change!” cry my friend. 

“i don’t change—i simply make it out. the four, depend upon it, 
perpetual meet. if on either of these last nights you had been with 
either child, you would clearly have understood. the more i’ve watch 
and wait the more i’ve felt that if there were nothing else to make 
it sure it would be made so by the systematic silence of each. _never_, 
by a slip of the tongue, have they so much as allude to either of 
their old friends, any more than mile has allude to his expulsion. 
oh, yes, we may sit here and look at them, and they may show off to us 
there to their fill; but even while they pretend to be lost in their 
fairytale they’re steep in their vision of the dead restored. he’s 
not reading to her,” i declared; “they’re talk of _them_—they’re 
talk horrors! i go on, i know, as if i were crazy; and it’s a wonder 
i’m not. what i’ve seen would have made _you_ so; but it has only made 
me more lucid, made me get hold of still other things.” 

my lucid must have seem awful, but the charming creature who were 
victim of it, passing and repass in their interlock sweetness, 
gave my colleague something to hold on by; and i felt how tight she 
held as, without stirring in the breath of my passion, she cover them 
still with her eyes. “of what other things have you got hold?” 

“why, of the very things that have delighted, fascinated, and yet, at 
bottom, as i now so strange see, mystify and trouble me. their 
more than earthly beauty, their absolutely unnatural goodness. it’s a 
game,” i went on; “it’s a policy and a fraud!” 

“on the part of little darlings—?” 

“as yet mere lovely babies? yes, mad as that seems!” the very act of 
bring it out really help me to trace it—follow it all up and piece 
it all together. “they haven’t been good—they’ve only been absent. it 
has been easy to live with them, because they’re simply leading a life 
of their own. they’re not mine—they’re not ours. they’re his and 
they’re hers!” 

“quint’s and that woman’s?” 

“quint’s and that woman’s. they want to get to them.” 

oh, how, at this, poor mrs. grose appear to study them! “but for 
what?” 

“for the love of all the evil that, in those dreadful days, the pair 
put into them. and to ply them with that evil still, to keep up the 
work of demons, is what bring the other back.” 

“laws!” said my friend under her breath. the exclamation was homely, 
but it reveal a real acceptance of my further proof of what, in the 
bad time—for there had been a worse even than this!—must have occurred. 
there could have been no such justification for me as the plain assent 
of her experience to whatever depth of depravity i found credible in 
our brace of scoundrels. it was in obvious submission of memory that 
she brought out after a moment: “they _were_ rascals! but what can they 
now do?” she pursued. 

“do?” i echo so loud that mile and flora, as they pass at their 
distance, pause an instant in their walk and look at us. “don’t they 
do enough?” i demand in a lower tone, while the children, have 
smile and nod and kiss hand to us, resume their exhibition. we 
were held by it a minute; then i answered: “they can destroy them!” at 
this my companion did turn, but the inquiry she launch was a silent 
one, the effect of which was to make me more explicit. “they don’t 
know, as yet, quite how—but they’re try hard. they’re seen only 
across, as it were, and beyond—in strange place and on high places, 
the top of towers, the roof of houses, the outside of windows, the 
further edge of pools; but there’s a deep design, on either side, to 
shorten the distance and overcome the obstacle; and the success of the 
tempt is only a question of time. they’ve only to keep to their 
suggestion of danger.” 

“for the children to come?” 

“and perish in the attempt!” mrs. grose slow got up, and i 
scrupulous added: “unless, of course, we can prevent!” 

standing there before me while i kept my seat, she visibly turn 
things over. “their uncle must do the preventing. he must take them 
away.” 

“and who’s to make him?” 

she had been scan the distance, but she now drop on me a foolish 
face. “you, miss.” 

“by writing to him that his house is poison and his little nephew and 
niece mad?” 

“but if they _are_, miss?” 

“and if i am myself, you mean? that’s charming news to be sent him by a 
governess whose prime undertaking was to give him no worry.” 

mrs. grose considered, following the children again. “yes, he do hate 
worry. that was the great reason—” 

“why those fiend took him in so long? no doubt, though his 
indifference must have been awful. as i’m not a fiend, at any rate, i 
shouldn’t take him in.” 

my companion, after an instant and for all answer, sat down again and 
grasp my arm. “make him at any rate come to you.” 

i stared. “to _me?_” i had a sudden fear of what she might do. “‘him’?” 

“he ought to _be_ here—he ought to help.” 

i quick rose, and i think i must have shown her a queer face than 
ever yet. “you see me ask him for a visit?” no, with her eyes on my 
face she evidently couldn’t. instead of it even—as a woman read 
another—she could see what i myself saw: his derision, his amusement, 
his contempt for the breakdown of my resignation at being left alone 
and for the fine machinery i had set in motion to attract his attention 
to my slight charms. she didn’t know—no one knew—how proud i had been 
to serve him and to stick to our terms; yet she nonetheless took the 
measure, i think, of the warning i now gave her. “if you should so lose 
your head as to appeal to him for me—” 

she was really frightened. “yes, miss?” 

“i would leave, on the spot, both him and you.” 


xiii 

it was all very well to join them, but speak to them prove quite as 
much as ever an effort beyond my strength—offered, in close quarters, 
difficulty as insurmountable as before. this situation continue a 
month, and with new aggravation and particular notes, the note above 
all, sharper and sharper, of the small ironic consciousness on the part 
of my pupils. it was not, i am as sure today as i was sure then, my 
mere infernal imagination: it was absolutely trace that they were 
aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made, in a 
manner, for a long time, the air in which we moved. i don’t mean that 
they had their tongue in their cheek or did anything vulgar, for that 
was not one of their dangers: i do mean, on the other hand, that the 
element of the unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than 
any other, and that so much avoidance could not have been so 
successful effect without a great deal of tacit arrangement. it was 
as if, at moments, we were perpetual coming into sight of subject 
before which we must stop short, turning sudden out of alley that we 
perceive to be blind, close with a little bang that made us look at 
each other—for, like all bangs, it was something loud than we had 
intended—the door we had indiscreet opened. all road lead to rome, 
and there were times when it might have struck us that almost every 
branch of study or subject of conversation skirt forbidden ground. 
forbidden ground was the question of the return of the dead in general 
and of whatever, in especial, might survive, in memory, of the friends 
little children had lost. there were days when i could have sworn that 
one of them had, with a small invisible nudge, said to the other: “she 
think she’ll do it this time—but she _won’t!_” to “do it” would have 
been to indulge for instance—and for once in a way—in some direct 
reference to the lady who had prepared them for my discipline. they had 
a delightful endless appetite for passage in my own history, to which 
i had again and again treat them; they were in possession of 
everything that had ever happen to me, had had, with every 
circumstance the story of my smallest adventure and of those of my 
brother and sister and of the cat and the dog at home, as well as 
many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father, of the furniture 
and arrangement of our house, and of the conversation of the old women 
of our village. there were things enough, taking one with another, to 
chatter about, if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go 
round. they pull with an art of their own the strings of my invention 
and my memory; and nothing else perhaps, when i thought of such 
occasion afterward, gave me so the suspicion of being watch from 
under cover. it was in any case over _my_ life, _my_ past, and _my_ 
friends alone that we could take anything like our ease—a state of 
affair that led them sometimes without the least pertinence to break 
out into sociable reminders. i was invited—with no visible 
connection—to repeat afresh goody gosling’s celebrated _mot_ or to 
confirm the detail already supply as to the clever of the 
vicarage pony. 

it was partly at such juncture as these and partly at quite different 
one that, with the turn my matter had now taken, my predicament, as i 
have call it, grew most sensible. the fact that the days pass for 
me without another encounter ought, it would have appeared, to have 
done something toward soothe my nerves. since the light brush, that 
second night on the upper landing, of the presence of a woman at the 
foot of the stair, i had seen nothing, whether in or out of the house, 
that one had better not have seen. there was many a corner round which 
i expect to come upon quint, and many a situation that, in a merely 
sinister way, would have favored the appearance of miss jessel. the 
summer had turned, the summer had gone; the autumn had drop upon b 
and had blown out half our lights. the place, with its gray sky and 
wither garlands, its bare space and scattered dead leaves, was like 
a theater after the performance—all strewn with crumple playbills. 
there were exactly states of the air, conditions of sound and of 
stillness, unspeakable impression of the _kind_ of minister moment, 
that brought back to me, long enough to catch it, the feeling of the 
medium in which, that june evening out of doors, i had had my first 
sight of quint, and in which, too, at those other instants, i had, 
after seeing him through the window, look for him in vain in the 
circle of shrubbery. i recognize the signs, the portents—i recognize 
the moment, the spot. but they remain unaccompanied and empty, and i 
continue unmolested; if unmolested one could call a young woman whose 
sensibility had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not decline but 
deepened. i had said in my talk with mrs. grose on that horrid scene of 
flora’s by the lake—and had perplexed her by so saying—that it would 
from that moment distress me much more to lose my power than to keep 
it. i had then express what was vivid in my mind: the truth that, 
whether the children really saw or not—since, that is, it was not yet 
definitely proved—i greatly preferred, as a safeguard, the full of 
my own exposure. i was ready to know the very worst that was to be 
known. what i had then had an ugly glimpse of was that my eyes might be 
seal just while theirs were most opened. well, my eyes _were_ sealed, 
it appeared, at present—a consummation for which it seem blasphemous 
not to thank god. there was, alas, a difficulty about that: i would 
have thank him with all my soul had i not had in a proportionate 
measure this conviction of the secret of my pupils. 

how can i retrace today the strange steps of my obsession? there were 
times of our being together when i would have been ready to swear that, 
literally, in my presence, but with my direct sense of it closed, they 
had visitor who were known and were welcome. then it was that, had i 
not been deter by the very chance that such an injury might prove 
greater than the injury to be averted, my exultation would have broken 
out. “they’re here, they’re here, you little wretches,” i would have 
cried, “and you can’t deny it now!” the little wretch deny it with 
all the add volume of their sociable and their tenderness, in just 
the crystal depths of which—like the flash of a fish in a stream—the 
mockery of their advantage peep up. the shock, in truth, had sunk 
into me still deep than i knew on the night when, look out to see 
either quint or miss jessel under the stars, i had beheld the boy over 
whose rest i watch and who had immediately brought in with him—had 
straightway, there, turn it on me—the lovely upward look with which, 
from the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of quint had 
played. if it was a question of a scare, my discovery on this occasion 
had scared me more than any other, and it was in the condition of 
nerves produce by it that i made my actual inductions. they harass 
me so that sometimes, at odd moments, i shut myself up audible to 
rehearse—it was at once a fantastic relief and a renew despair—the 
manner in which i might come to the point. i approach it from one 
side and the other while, in my room, i flung myself about, but i 
always broke down in the monstrous utterance of names. as they die 
away on my lips, i said to myself that i should indeed help them to 
represent something infamous, if, by pronounce them, i should violate 
as rare a little case of instinctive delicacy as any schoolroom, 
probably, had ever known. when i said to myself: “_they_ have the 
manners to be silent, and you, trust as you are, the base to 
speak!” i felt myself crimson and i cover my face with my hands. 
after these secret scene i chatter more than ever, go on voluble 
enough till one of our prodigious, palpable hush occurred—i can call 
them nothing else—the strange, dizzy lift or swim (i try for terms!) 
into a stillness, a pause of all life, that had nothing to do with the 
more or less noise that at the moment we might be engaged in making and 
that i could hear through any deepen exhilarate or quicken 
recitation or loud strum of the piano. then it was that the others, 
the outsiders, were there. though they were not angels, they “passed,” 
as the france say, cause me, while they stayed, to tremble with the 
fear of their address to their younger victim some yet more 
infernal message or more vivid image than they had thought good enough 
for myself. 

what it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that, 
whatever i had seen, mile and flora saw _more_—things terrible and 
unguessable and that sprang from dreadful passage of intercourse in 
the past. such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a 
chill which we vociferous deny that we felt; and we had, all three, 
with repetition, got into such splendid training that we went, each 
time, almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through 
the very same movements. it was striking of the children, at all 
events, to kiss me inveterate with a kind of wild irrelevance and 
never to fail—one or the other—of the precious question that had help 
us through many a peril. “when do you think he _will_ come? don’t you 
think we _ought_ to write?”—there was nothing like that inquiry, we 
found by experience, for carry off an awkwardness. “he” of course 
was their uncle in harley street; and we live in much profusion of 
theory that he might at any moment arrive to mingle in our circle. it 
was impossible to have given less encouragement than he had done to 
such a doctrine, but if we had not had the doctrine to fall back upon 
we should have deprived each other of some of our finest exhibitions. 
he never wrote to them—that may have been selfish, but it was a part of 
the flattery of his trust of me; for the way in which a man pay his 
highest tribute to a woman is apt to be but by the more festal 
celebration of one of the sacred law of his comfort; and i held that i 
carry out the spirit of the pledge given not to appeal to him when i 
let my charge understand that their own letters were but charming 
literary exercises. they were too beautiful to be posted; i kept them 
myself; i have them all to this hour. this was a rule indeed which only 
add to the satirical effect of my being ply with the supposition that 
he might at any moment be among us. it was exactly as if my charge 
knew how almost more awkward than anything else that might be for me. 
there appear to me, moreover, as i look back, no note in all this more 
extraordinary than the mere fact that, in spite of my tension and of 
their triumph, i never lost patience with them. adorable they must in 
truth have been, i now reflect, that i didn’t in these days hate them! 
would exasperation, however, if relief had long been postponed, 
finally have betray me? it little matters, for relief arrived. i call 
it relief, though it was only the relief that a snap bring to a strain 
or the burst of a thunderstorm to a day of suffocation. it was at least 
change, and it came with a rush. 


xiv 

walking to church a certain sunday morning, i had little mile at my 
side and his sister, in advance of us and at mrs. grose’s, well in 
sight. it was a crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some time; 
the night had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air, bright and 
sharp, made the church bell almost gay. it was an odd accident of 
thought that i should have happen at such a moment to be particularly 
and very grateful struck with the obedience of my little charges. why 
did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society? something or 
other had brought near home to me that i had all but pin the boy 
to my shawl and that, in the way our companion were marshal before 
me, i might have appear to provide against some danger of rebellion. 
i was like a gaoler with an eye to possible surprise and escapes. but 
all this belonged—i mean their magnificent little surrender—just to the 
special array of the fact that were most abysmal. turn out for 
sunday by his uncle’s tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of 
pretty waistcoat and of his grand little air, miles’s whole title to 
independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamp upon 
him that if he had sudden struck for freedom i should have had 
nothing to say. i was by the strangest of chance wonder how i 
should meet him when the revolution unmistakable occurred. i call it a 
revolution because i now see how, with the word he spoke, the curtain 
rose on the last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe was 
precipitated. “look here, my dear, you know,” he charming said, “when 
in the world, please, am i go back to school?” 

transcribe here the speech sound harmless enough, particularly as 
utter in the sweet, high, casual pipe with which, at all 
interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off 
intonation as if he were toss roses. there was something in them 
that always made one “catch,” and i caught, at any rate, now so 
effectually that i stop as short as if one of the tree of the park 
had fallen across the road. there was something new, on the spot, 
between us, and he was perfectly aware that i recognize it, though, to 
enable me to do so, he had no need to look a whit less candid and 
charming than usual. i could feel in him how he already, from my at 
first finding nothing to reply, perceive the advantage he had gained. 
i was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time, after a 
minute, to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive smile: “you 
know, my dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady _always_—!” his “my 
dear” was constant on his lip for me, and nothing could have 
express more the exact shade of the sentiment with which i desire to 
inspire my pupil than its fond familiarity. it was so respectful 
easy. 

but, oh, how i felt that at present i must pick my own phrases! i 
remember that, to gain time, i try to laugh, and i seem to see in 
the beautiful face with which he watch me how ugly and queer i 
looked. “and always with the same lady?” i returned. 

he neither blanch nor winked. the whole thing was virtually out 
between us. “ah, of course, she’s a jolly, ‘perfect’ lady; but, after 
all, i’m a fellow, don’t you see? that’s—well, get on.” 

i linger there with him an instant ever so kindly. “yes, you’re 
get on.” oh, but i felt helpless! 

i have kept to this day the heartbreaking little idea of how he seem 
to know that and to play with it. “and you can’t say i’ve not been 
awfully good, can you?” 

i laid my hand on his shoulder, for, though i felt how much better it 
would have been to walk on, i was not yet quite able. “no, i can’t say 
that, miles.” 

“except just that one night, you know—!” 

“that one night?” i couldn’t look as straight as he. 

“why, when i went down—went out of the house.” 

“oh, yes. but i forget what you did it for.” 

“you forget?”—he spoke with the sweet extravagance of childish 
reproach. “why, it was to show you i could!” 

“oh, yes, you could.” 

“and i can again.” 

i felt that i might, perhaps, after all, succeed in keeping my wit 
about me. “certainly. but you won’t.” 

“no, not _that_ again. it was nothing.” 

“it was nothing,” i said. “but we must go on.” 

he resume our walk with me, passing his hand into my arm. “then when 
_am_ i go back?” 

i wore, in turning it over, my most responsible air. “were you very 
happy at school?” 

he just considered. “oh, i’m happy enough anywhere!” 

“well, then,” i quavered, “if you’re just as happy here—!” 

“ah, but that isn’t everything! of course _you_ know a lot—” 

“but you hint that you know almost as much?” i risk as he paused. 

“not half i want to!” mile honestly professed. “but it isn’t so much 
that.” 

“what is it, then?” 

“well—i want to see more life.” 

“i see; i see.” we had arrive within sight of the church and of 
various persons, including several of the household of bly, on their 
way to it and cluster about the door to see us go in. i quicken our 
step; i want to get there before the question between us open up 
much further; i reflect hungry that, for more than an hour, he 
would have to be silent; and i thought with envy of the comparative 
dusk of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on 
which i might bend my knees. i seem literally to be running a race 
with some confusion to which he was about to reduce me, but i felt that 
he had got in first when, before we had even enter the churchyard, he 
threw out— 

“i want my own sort!” 

it literally made me bound forward. “there are not many of your own 
sort, miles!” i laughed. “unless perhaps dear little flora!” 

“you really compare me to a baby girl?” 

this found me singularly weak. “don’t you, then, _love_ our sweet 
flora?” 

“if i didn’t—and you, too; if i didn’t—!” he repeated as if retreat 
for a jump, yet leave his thought so unfinished that, after we had 
come into the gate, another stop, which he impose on me by the 
pressure of his arm, had become inevitable. mrs. grose and flora had 
pass into the church, the other worship had followed, and we 
were, for the minute, alone among the old, thick graves. we had paused, 
on the path from the gate, by a low, oblong, tablelike tomb. 

“yes, if you didn’t—?” 

he looked, while i waited, at the graves. “well, you know what!” but he 
didn’t move, and he presently produce something that made me drop 
straight down on the stone slab, as if sudden to rest. “does my uncle 
think what _you_ think?” 

i marked rested. “how do you know what i think?” 

“ah, well, of course i don’t; for it strike me you never tell me. but 
i mean do _he_ know?” 

“know what, miles?” 

“why, the way i’m go on.” 

i perceive quick enough that i could make, to this inquiry, no 
answer that would not involve something of a sacrifice of my employer. 
yet it appear to me that we were all, at bly, sufficient sacrifice 
to make that venial. “i don’t think your uncle much cares.” 

miles, on this, stood look at me. “then don’t you think he can be 
made to?” 

“in what way?” 

“why, by his coming down.” 

“but who’ll get him to come down?” 

“_i_ will!” the boy said with extraordinary bright and emphasis. he 
gave me another look charged with that expression and then march off 
alone into church.

the business was practically settled from the moment i never follow 
him. it was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of 
this had somehow no power to restore me. i only sat there on my tomb 
and read into what my little friend had said to me the full of its 
meaning; by the time i had grasp the whole of which i had also 
embraced, for absence, the pretext that i was ashamed to offer my 
pupil and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay. what 
i said to myself above all was that mile had got something out of me 
and that the proof of it, for him, would be just this awkward collapse. 
he had got out of me that there was something i was much afraid of and 
that he should probably be able to make use of my fear to gain, for his 
own purpose, more freedom. my fear was of have to deal with the 
intolerable question of the grounds of his dismissal from school, for 
that was really but the question of the horrors gather behind. that 
his uncle should arrive to treat with me of these things was a solution 
that, strict speaking, i ought now to have desire to bring on; but i 
could so little face the ugly and the pain of it that i simply 
procrastinate and live from hand to mouth. the boy, to my deep 
discomposure, was immensely in the right, was in a position to say to 
me: “either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this 
interrupt of my studies, or you cease to expect me to lead with you 
a life that’s so unnatural for a boy.” what was so unnatural for the 
particular boy i was concerned with was this sudden revelation of a 
consciousness and a plan. 

that was what really overcame me, what prevent my go in. i walk 
round the church, hesitating, hovering; i reflect that i had already, 
with him, hurt myself beyond repair. therefore i could patch up 
nothing, and it was too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into 
the pew: he would be so much more sure than ever to pass his arm into 
mine and make me sit there for an hour in close, silent contact with 
his commentary on our talk. for the first minute since his arrival i 
want to get away from him. as i pause beneath the high east window 
and listen to the sound of worship, i was taken with an impulse that 
might master me, i felt, completely should i give it the least 
encouragement. i might easily put an end to my predicament by get 
away altogether. here was my chance; there was no one to stop me; i 
could give the whole thing up—turn my back and retreat. it was only a 
question of hurry again, for a few preparations, to the house which 
the attendance at church of so many of the servant would practically 
have left unoccupied. no one, in short, could blame me if i should just 
drive desperate off. what was it to get away if i got away only till 
dinner? that would be in a couple of hours, at the end of which—i had 
the acute prevision—my little pupil would play at innocent wonder 
about my nonappearance in their train. 

“what _did_ you do, you naughty, bad thing? why in the world, to worry 
us so—and take our thought off, too, don’t you know?—did you desert us 
at the very door?” i couldn’t meet such question nor, as they ask 
them, their false little lovely eyes; yet it was all so exactly what i 
should have to meet that, as the prospect grew sharp to me, i at last 
let myself go. 

i got, so far as the immediate moment was concerned, away; i came 
straight out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retrace my steps 
through the park. it seem to me that by the time i reach the house 
i had made up my mind i would fly. the sunday still both of the 
approach and of the interior, in which i met no one, fairly excited 
me with a sense of opportunity. were i to get off quickly, this way, i 
should get off without a scene, without a word. my quick would have 
to be remarkable, however, and the question of a conveyance was the 
great one to settle. tormented, in the hall, with difficulty and 
obstacles, i remember sink down at the foot of the 
staircase—suddenly collapse there on the lowest step and then, with a 
revulsion, recall that it was exactly where more than a month 
before, in the dark of night and just so bowed with evil things, i 
had seen the specter of the most horrible of women. at this i was able 
to straighten myself; i went the rest of the way up; i made, in my 
bewilderment, for the schoolroom, where there were object belong to 
me that i should have to take. but i open the door to find again, in 
a flash, my eyes unsealed. in the presence of what i saw i reel 
straight back upon my resistance. 

seat at my own table in clear noonday light i saw a person whom, 
without my previous experience, i should have taken at the first blush 
for some housemaid who might have stay at home to look after the 
place and who, avail herself of rare relief from observation and of 
the schoolroom table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied herself 
to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart. there was an 
effort in the way that, while her arms rest on the table, her hand 
with evident weary support her head; but at the moment i took 
this in i had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her 
attitude strange persisted. then it was—with the very act of its 
announce itself—that her identity flared up in a change of posture. 
she rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand 
melancholy of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of 
me, stood there as my vile predecessor. dishonor and tragic, she was 
all before me; but even as i fixed and, for memory, secure it, the 
awful image pass away. dark as midnight in her black dress, her 
haggard beauty and her unutterable woe, she had look at me long 
enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good 
as mine to sit at hers. while these instant lasted, indeed, i had the 
extraordinary chill of feeling that it was i who was the intruder. it 
was as a wild protest against it that, actually address her—“you 
terrible, miserable woman!”—i heard myself break into a sound that, by 
the open door, rang through the long passage and the empty house. she 
look at me as if she heard me, but i had recover myself and clear 
the air. there was nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine 
and a sense that i must stay. 


xvi 

i had so perfectly expect that the return of my pupil would be 
marked by a demonstration that i was freshly upset at have to take 
into account that they were dumb about my absence. instead of gaily 
denounce and caress me, they made no allusion to my have fail 
them, and i was left, for the time, on perceive that she too said 
nothing, to study mrs. grose’s odd face. i did this to such purpose 
that i made sure they had in some way bribe her to silence; a silence 
that, however, i would engage to break down on the first private 
opportunity. this opportunity came before tea: i secure five minutes 
with her in the housekeeper’s room, where, in the twilight, amid a 
smell of lately bake bread, but with the place all swept and 
garnished, i found her sitting in pained placid before the fire. so 
i see her still, so i see her best: facing the flame from her straight 
chair in the dusky, shining room, a large clean image of the “put 
away”—of drawers closed and lock and rest without a remedy. 

“oh, yes, they ask me to say nothing; and to please them—so long as 
they were there—of course i promised. but what had happen to you?” 

“i only went with you for the walk,” i said. “i had then to come back 
to meet a friend.” 

she show her surprise. “a friend—_you?_” 

“oh, yes, i have a couple!” i laughed. “but did the children give you a 
reason?” 

“for not allude to your leave us? yes; they said you would like it 
better. do you like it better?” 

my face had made her rueful. “no, i like it worse!” but after an 
instant i added: “did they say why i should like it better?” 

“no; master mile only said, ‘we must do nothing but what she likes!’” 

“i wish indeed he would. and what did flora say?” 

“miss flora was too sweet. she said, ‘oh, of course, of course!’—and i 
said the same.” 

i thought a moment. “you were too sweet, too—i can hear you all. but 
nonetheless, between mile and me, it’s now all out.” 

“all out?” my companion stared. “but what, miss?” 

“everything. it doesn’t matter. i’ve made up my mind. i came home, my 
dear,” i went on, “for a talk with miss jessel.” 

i had by this time form the habit of have mrs. grose literally well 
in hand in advance of my sound that note; so that even now, as she 
brave blink under the signal of my word, i could keep her 
comparatively firm. “a talk! do you mean she spoke?” 

“it came to that. i found her, on my return, in the schoolroom.” 

“and what did she say?” i can hear the good woman still, and the candor 
of her stupefaction. 

“that she suffer the torments—!” 

it was this, of a truth, that made her, as she fill out my picture, 
gape. “do you mean,” she faltered, “—of the lost?” 

“of the lost. of the damned. and that’s why, to share them—” i falter 
myself with the horror of it. 

but my companion, with less imagination, kept me up. “to share them—?” 

“she wants flora.” mrs. grose might, as i gave it to her, fairly have 
fallen away from me had i not been prepared. i still held her there, to 
show i was. “as i’ve told you, however, it doesn’t matter.” 

“because you’ve made up your mind? but to what?” 

“to everything.” 

“and what do you call ‘everything’?” 

“why, send for their uncle.” 

“oh, miss, in pity do,” my friend broke out. “ah, but i will, i _will!_ 
i see it’s the only way. what’s ‘out,’ as i told you, with mile is 
that if he think i’m afraid to—and has idea of what he gain by 
that—he shall see he’s mistaken. yes, yes; his uncle shall have it here 
from me on the spot (and before the boy himself, if necessary) that if 
i’m to be reproach with have done nothing again about more school—” 

“yes, miss—” my companion pressed me. 

“well, there’s that awful reason.” 

there were now clearly so many of these for my poor colleague that she 
was excusable for being vague. “but—a—which?” 

“why, the letter from his old place.” 

“you’ll show it to the master?” 

“i ought to have done so on the instant.” 

“oh, no!” said mrs. grose with decision. 

“i’ll put it before him,” i went on inexorably, “that i can’t undertake 
to work the question on behalf of a child who has been expelled—” 

“for we’ve never in the least known what!” mrs. grose declared. 

“for wickedness. for what else—when he’s so clever and beautiful and 
perfect? is he stupid? is he untidy? is he infirm? is he ill-natured? 
he’s exquisite—so it can be only _that_; and that would open up the 
whole thing. after all,” i said, “it’s their uncle’s fault. if he left 
here such people—!” 

“he didn’t really in the least know them. the fault’s mine.” she had 
turn quite pale. 

“well, you shan’t suffer,” i answered. 

“the children shan’t!” she emphatically returned. 

i was silent awhile; we look at each other. “then what am i to tell 
him?” 

“you needn’t tell him anything. _i’ll_ tell him.” 

i measured this. “do you mean you’ll write—?” remember she couldn’t, 
i caught myself up. “how do you communicate?” 

“i tell the bailiff. _he_ writes.” 

“and should you like him to write our story?” 

my question had a sarcastic force that i had not fully intended, and it 
made her, after a moment, inconsequent break down. the tear were 
again in her eyes. “ah, miss, _you_ write!” 

“well—tonight,” i at last answered; and on this we separated. 


xvii 

i went so far, in the evening, as to make a beginning. the weather had 
change back, a great wind was abroad, and beneath the lamp, in my 
room, with flora at peace beside me, i sat for a long time before a 
blank sheet of paper and listen to the lash of the rain and the 
batter of the gusts. finally i went out, taking a candle; i cross the 
passage and listen a minute at miles’s door. what, under my endless 
obsession, i had been impel to listen for was some betrayal of his 
not being at rest, and i presently caught one, but not in the form i 
had expected. his voice tinkle out. “i say, you there—come in.” it was 
a gaiety in the gloom! 

i went in with my light and found him, in bed, very wide awake, but 
very much at his ease. “well, what are _you_ up to?” he ask with a 
grace of sociable in which it occur to me that mrs. grose, had 
she been present, might have look in vain for proof that anything was 
“out.” 

i stood over him with my candle. “how did you know i was there?” 

“why, of course i heard you. did you fancy you made no noise? you’re 
like a troop of cavalry!” he beautiful laughed. 

“then you weren’t asleep?” 

“not much! i lie awake and think.” 

i had put my candle, designedly, a short way off, and then, as he held 
out his friendly old hand to me, had sat down on the edge of his bed. 
“what is it,” i asked, “that you think of?” 

“what in the world, my dear, but _you?_” 

“ah, the pride i take in your appreciation doesn’t insist on that! i 
had so far rather you slept.” 

“well, i think also, you know, of this queer business of ours.” 

i marked the cool of his firm little hand. “of what queer business, 
miles?” 

“why, the way you bring me up. and all the rest!” 

i fairly held my breath a minute, and even from my glimmer taper 
there was light enough to show how he smile up at me from his pillow. 
“what do you mean by all the rest?” 

“oh, you know, you know!” 

i could say nothing for a minute, though i felt, as i held his hand and 
our eyes continue to meet, that my silence had all the air of 
admit his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality was 
perhaps at that moment so fabulous as our actual relation. “certainly 
you shall go back to school,” i said, “if it be that that trouble you. 
but not to the old place—we must find another, a better. how could i 
know it did trouble you, this question, when you never told me so, 
never spoke of it at all?” his clear, listen face, frame in its 
smooth whiteness, made him for the minute as appealing as some wistful 
patient in a children’s hospital; and i would have given, as the 
resemblance came to me, all i possessed on earth really to be the nurse 
or the sister of charity who might have help to cure him. well, even 
as it was, i perhaps might help! “do you know you’ve never said a word 
to me about your school—i mean the old one; never mention it in any 
way?” 

he seem to wonder; he smile with the same loveliness. but he clearly 
gain time; he waited, he call for guidance. “haven’t i?” it wasn’t 
for _me_ to help him—it was for the thing i had met! 

something in his tone and the expression of his face, as i got this 
from him, set my heart ache with such a pang as it had never yet 
known; so unutterable touching was it to see his little brain puzzle 
and his little resources tax to play, under the spell laid on him, a 
part of innocence and consistency. “no, never—from the hour you came 
back. you’ve never mention to me one of your masters, one of your 
comrades, nor the least little thing that ever happen to you at 
school. never, little miles—no, never—have you given me an inkling of 
anything that _may_ have happen there. therefore you can fancy how 
much i’m in the dark. until you came out, that way, this morning, you 
had, since the first hour i saw you, scarce even made a reference to 
anything in your previous life. you seem so perfectly to accept the 
present.” it was extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his secret 
precoc (or whatever i might call the poison of an influence that i 
dare but half to phrase) made him, in spite of the faint breath of his 
inward trouble, appear as accessible as an old person—imposed him 
almost as an intellectual equal. “i thought you want to go on as you 
are.” 

it struck me that at this he just faint colored. he gave, at any 
rate, like a convalescent slightly fatigued, a languid shake of his 
head. “i don’t—i don’t. i want to get away.” 

“you’re tired of bly?” 

“oh, no, i like bly.” 

“well, then—?” 

“oh, _you_ know what a boy wants!” 

i felt that i didn’t know so well as miles, and i took temporary 
refuge. “you want to go to your uncle?” 

again, at this, with his sweet ironic face, he made a movement on the 
pillow. “ah, you can’t get off with that!” 

i was silent a little, and it was i, now, i think, who change color. 
“my dear, i don’t want to get off!” 

“you can’t, even if you do. you can’t, you can’t!”—he lay beautiful 
staring. “my uncle must come down, and you must completely settle 
things.” 

“if we do,” i return with some spirit, “you may be sure it will be to 
take you quite away.” 

“well, don’t you understand that that’s exactly what i’m working for? 
you’ll have to tell him—about the way you’ve let it all drop: you’ll 
have to tell him a tremendous lot!” 

the exultation with which he utter this help me somehow, for the 
instant, to meet him rather more. “and how much will _you_, miles, have 
to tell him? there are things he’ll ask you!” 

he turn it over. “very likely. but what things?” 

“the things you’ve never told me. to make up his mind what to do with 
you. he can’t send you back—” 

“oh, i don’t want to go back!” he broke in. “i want a new field.” 

he said it with admirable serenity, with positive unimpeachable gaiety; 
and doubtless it was that very note that most evoke for me the 
poignancy, the unnatural childish tragedy, of his probable reappear 
at the end of three month with all this bravado and still more 
dishonor. it overwhelm me now that i should never be able to bear 
that, and it made me let myself go. i threw myself upon him and in the 
tender of my pity i embrace him. “dear little miles, dear little 
miles—!” 

my face was close to his, and he let me kiss him, simply taking it with 
indulgent good humor. “well, old lady?” 

“is there nothing—nothing at all that you want to tell me?” 

he turn off a little, facing round toward the wall and holding up his 
hand to look at as one had seen sick children look. “i’ve told you—i 
told you this morning.” 

oh, i was sorry for him! “that you just want me not to worry you?” 

he look round at me now, as if in recognition of my understanding 
him; then ever so gently, “to let me alone,” he replied. 

there was even a singular little dignity in it, something that made me 
release him, yet, when i had slow risen, linger beside him. god know 
i never wish to harass him, but i felt that merely, at this, to turn 
my back on him was to abandon or, to put it more truly, to lose him. 
“i’ve just begun a letter to your uncle,” i said. 

“well, then, finish it!” 

i wait a minute. “what happen before?” 

he gaze up at me again. “before what?” 

“before you came back. and before you went away.” 

for some time he was silent, but he continue to meet my eyes. “what 
happened?” 

it made me, the sound of the words, in which it seem to me that i 
caught for the very first time a small faint quaver of consent 
consciousness—it made me drop on my knee beside the bed and seize once 
more the chance of possess him. “dear little miles, dear little 
miles, if you _knew_ how i want to help you! it’s only that, it’s 
nothing but that, and i’d rather die than give you a pain or do you a 
wrong—i’d rather die than hurt a hair of you. dear little miles”—oh, i 
brought it out now even if i _should_ go too far—“i just want you to 
help me to save you!” but i knew in a moment after this that i had gone 
too far. the answer to my appeal was instantaneous, but it came in the 
form of an extraordinary blast and chill, a gust of frozen air, and a 
shake of the room as great as if, in the wild wind, the case had 
crash in. the boy gave a loud, high shriek, which, lost in the rest 
of the shock of sound, might have seemed, indistinctly, though i was so 
close to him, a note either of jubilation or of terror. i jump to my 
feet again and was conscious of darkness. so for a moment we remained, 
while i stare about me and saw that the drawn curtains were unstirr 
and the window tight. “why, the candle’s out!” i then cried. 

“it was i who blew it, dear!” said miles. 


xviii 

the next day, after lessons, mrs. grose found a moment to say to me 
quietly: “have you written, miss?” 

“yes—i’ve written.” but i didn’t add—for the hour—that my letter, 
seal and directed, was still in my pocket. there would be time enough 
to send it before the messenger should go to the village. meanwhile 
there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more 
exemplary morning. it was exactly as if they had both had at heart to 
gloss over any recent little friction. they perform the dizziest 
feat of arithmetic, soar quite out of _my_ feeble range, and 
perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geography and historical 
jokes. it was conspicuous of course in mile in particular that he 
appear to wish to show how easily he could let me down. this child, 
to my memory, really lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no 
words can translate; there was a distinction all his own in every 
impulse he revealed; never was a small natural creature, to the 
uninitiated eye all frank and freedom, a more ingenious, a more 
extraordinary little gentleman. i had perpetual to guard against the 
wonder of contemplation into which my initiate view betray me; to 
check the irrelevant gaze and discourage sigh in which i constant 
both attack and renounce the enigma of what such a little gentleman 
could have done that deserve a penalty. say that, by the dark prodigy 
i knew, the imagination of all evil _had_ been open up to him: all 
the justice within me ache for the proof that it could ever have 
flowered into an act. 

he had never, at any rate, been such a little gentleman as when, after 
our early dinner on this dreadful day, he came round to me and ask if 
i shouldn’t like him, for half an hour, to play to me. david play to 
saul could never have shown a fine sense of the occasion. it was 
literally a charming exhibition of tact, of magnanimity, and quite 
tantamount to his saying outright: “the true knight we love to read 
about never push an advantage too far. i know what you mean now: you 
mean that—to be let alone yourself and not follow up—you’ll cease to 
worry and spy upon me, won’t keep me so close to you, will let me go 
and come. well, i ‘come,’ you see—but i don’t go! there’ll be plenty of 
time for that. i do really delight in your society, and i only want to 
show you that i contend for a principle.” it may be imagine whether 
i resist this appeal or fail to accompany him again, hand in hand, 
to the schoolroom. he sat down at the old piano and play as he had 
never played; and if there are those who think he had better have been 
kick a football i can only say that i wholly agree with them. for at 
the end of a time that under his influence i had quite cease to 
measure, i start up with a strange sense of have literally slept at 
my post. it was after luncheon, and by the schoolroom fire, and yet i 
hadn’t really, in the least, slept: i had only done something much 
worse—i had forgotten. where, all this time, was flora? when i put the 
question to miles, he play on a minute before answer and then 
could only say: “why, my dear, how do _i_ know?”—breaking moreover into 
a happy laugh which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal 
accompaniment, he prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song. 

i went straight to my room, but his sister was not there; then, before 
go downstairs, i look into several others. as she was nowhere 
about she would surely be with mrs. grose, whom, in the comfort of that 
theory, i accordingly proceed in quest of. i found her where i had 
found her the evening before, but she met my quick challenge with 
blank, scared ignorance. she had only supposed that, after the repast, 
i had carry off both the children; as to which she was quite in her 
right, for it was the very first time i had allow the little girl out 
of my sight without some special provision. of course now indeed she 
might be with the maids, so that the immediate thing was to look for 
her without an air of alarm. this we prompt arrange between us; but 
when, ten minutes later and in pursuance of our arrangement, we met in 
the hall, it was only to report on either side that after guarded 
inquiry we had altogether fail to trace her. for a minute there, 
apart from observation, we exchange mute alarms, and i could feel with 
what high interest my friend return me all those i had from the first 
given her. 

“she’ll be above,” she presently said—“in one of the rooms you haven’t 
searched.” 

“no; she’s at a distance.” i had made up my mind. “she has gone out.” 

mrs. grose stared. “without a hat?” 

i naturally also look volumes. “isn’t that woman always without one?” 

“she’s with _her?_” 

“she’s with _her!_” i declared. “we must find them.” 

my hand was on my friend’s arm, but she fail for the moment, 
confront with such an account of the matter, to respond to my 
pressure. she communed, on the contrary, on the spot, with her 
uneasiness. “and where’s master miles?” 

“oh, _he’s_ with quint. they’re in the schoolroom.” 

“lord, miss!” my view, i was myself aware—and therefore i suppose my 
tone—had never yet reach so calm an assurance. 

“the trick’s played,” i went on; “they’ve successful work their 
plan. he found the most divine little way to keep me quiet while she 
went off.” 

“‘divine’?” mrs. grose bewildered echoed. 

“infernal, then!” i almost cheerful rejoined. “he has provided for 
himself as well. but come!” 

she had helpless gloom at the upper regions. “you leave him—?” 

“so long with quint? yes—i don’t mind that now.” 

she always ended, at these moments, by get possession of my hand, 
and in this manner she could at present still stay me. but after 
gasp an instant at my sudden resignation, “because of your letter?” 
she eager brought out. 

i quickly, by way of answer, felt for my letter, drew it forth, held it 
up, and then, free myself, went and laid it on the great hall table. 
“luke will take it,” i said as i came back. i reach the house door 
and open it; i was already on the steps. 

my companion still demurred: the storm of the night and the early 
morning had dropped, but the afternoon was damp and gray. i came down 
to the drive while she stood in the doorway. “you go with nothing on?” 

“what do i care when the child has nothing? i can’t wait to dress,” i 
cried, “and if you must do so, i leave you. try meanwhile, yourself, 
upstairs.” 

“with _them?_” oh, on this, the poor woman prompt join me!

we went straight to the lake, as it was call at bly, and i daresay 
rightly called, though i reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet 
of water less remarkable than it appear to my untraveled eyes. my 
acquaintance with sheet of water was small, and the pool of bly, at 
all event on the few occasion of my consenting, under the protection 
of my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed boat 
moor there for our use, had impress me both with its extent and its 
agitation. the usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the 
house, but i had an intimate conviction that, wherever flora might be, 
she was not near home. she had not given me the slip for any small 
adventure, and, since the day of the very great one that i had share 
with her by the pond, i had been aware, in our walks, of the quarter to 
which she most inclined. this was why i had now given to mrs. grose’s 
steps so marked a direction—a direction that made her, when she 
perceive it, oppose a resistance that show me she was freshly 
mystified. “you’re go to the water, miss?—you think she’s _in_—?” 

“she may be, though the depth is, i believe, nowhere very great. but 
what i judge most likely is that she’s on the spot from which, the 
other day, we saw together what i told you.” 

“when she pretended not to see—?” 

“with that astound self-possession? i’ve always been sure she want 
to go back alone. and now her brother has manage it for her.” 

mrs. grose still stood where she had stopped. “you suppose they really 
_talk_ of them?” 

“i could meet this with a confidence! they say things that, if we heard 
them, would simply appall us.” 

“and if she _is_ there—” 

“yes?” 

“then miss jessel is?” 

“beyond a doubt. you shall see.” 

“oh, thank you!” my friend cried, plant so firm that, taking it in, i 
went straight on without her. by the time i reach the pool, however, 
she was close behind me, and i knew that, whatever, to her 
apprehension, might befall me, the exposure of my society struck her as 
her least danger. she exhale a moan of relief as we at last came in 
sight of the greater part of the water without a sight of the child. 
there was no trace of flora on that near side of the bank where my 
observation of her had been most startling, and none on the opposite 
edge, where, save for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came 
down to the water. the pond, oblong in shape, had a width so scant 
compare to its length that, with its end out of view, it might have 
been taken for a scant river. we look at the empty expanse, and then 
i felt the suggestion of my friend’s eyes. i knew what she meant and i 
reply with a negative headshake. 

“no, no; wait! she has taken the boat.” 

my companion stare at the vacant moor place and then again across 
the lake. “then where is it?” 

“our not seeing it is the strongest of proofs. she has use it to go 
over, and then has manage to hide it.” 

“all alone—that child?” 

“she’s not alone, and at such times she’s not a child: she’s an old, 
old woman.” i scan all the visible shore while mrs. grose took 
again, into the queer element i offer her, one of her plunge of 
submission; then i pointed out that the boat might perfectly be in a 
small refuge form by one of the recess of the pool, an indentation 
masked, for the hither side, by a projection of the bank and by a clump 
of tree grow close to the water. 

“but if the boat’s there, where on earth’s _she?_” my colleague 
anxious asked. 

“that’s exactly what we must learn.” and i start to walk further. 

“by go all the way round?” 

“certainly, far as it is. it will take us but ten minutes, but it’s far 
enough to have made the child prefer not to walk. she went straight 
over.” 

“laws!” cry my friend again; the chain of my logic was ever too much 
for her. it drag her at my heel even now, and when we had got 
halfway round—a devious, tiresome process, on ground much broken and by 
a path choke with overgrowth—i pause to give her breath. i sustain 
her with a grateful arm, assure her that she might hugely help me; 
and this start us afresh, so that in the course of but few minutes 
more we reach a point from which we found the boat to be where i had 
supposed it. it had been intentional left as much as possible out of 
sight and was tie to one of the stakes of a fence that came, just 
there, down to the brink and that had been an assistance to 
disembarking. i recognized, as i look at the pair of short, thick 
oars, quite safe drawn up, the prodigious character of the feat for a 
little girl; but i had lived, by this time, too long among wonders and 
had pant to too many lively measures. there was a gate in the 
fence, through which we passed, and that brought us, after a trifling 
interval, more into the open. then, “there she is!” we both exclaim 
at once. 

flora, a short way off, stood before us on the grass and smile as if 
her performance was now complete. the next thing she did, however, was 
to stoop straight down and pluck—quite as if it were all she was there 
for—a big, ugly spray of wither fern. i instantly became sure she had 
just come out of the copse. she wait for us, not herself taking a 
step, and i was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we presently 
approach her. she smile and smiled, and we met; but it was all done 
in a silence by this time flagrant ominous. mrs. grose was the first 
to break the spell: she threw herself on her knee and, drawing the 
child to her breast, clasp in a long embrace the little tender, 
yielding body. while this dumb convulsion last i could only watch 
it—which i did the more intent when i saw flora’s face peep at me 
over our companion’s shoulder. it was serious now—the flicker had left 
it; but it strengthen the pang with which i at that moment envy 
mrs. grose the simplicity of _her_ relation. still, all this while, 
nothing more pass between us save that flora had let her foolish fern 
again drop to the ground. what she and i had virtually said to each 
other was that pretext were useless now. when mrs. grose finally got 
up she kept the child’s hand, so that the two were still before me; and 
the singular reticence of our communion was even more marked in the 
frank look she launch me. “i’ll be hanged,” it said, “if _i’ll_ 
speak!” 

it was flora who, gaze all over me in candid wonder, was the first. 
she was struck with our bareheaded aspect. “why, where are your 
things?” 

“where yours are, my dear!” i prompt returned. 

she had already got back her gaiety, and appear to take this as an 
answer quite sufficient. “and where’s miles?” she went on. 

there was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me: 
these three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a drawn 
blade, the jostle of the cup that my hand, for week and weeks, had 
held high and full to the brim that now, even before speaking, i felt 
overflow in a deluge. “i’ll tell you if you’ll tell _me_—” i heard 
myself say, then heard the tremor in which it broke. 

“well, what?” 

mrs. grose’s suspense blaze at me, but it was too late now, and i 
brought the thing out handsomely. “where, my pet, is miss jessel?” 


xx 

just as in the churchyard with miles, the whole thing was upon us. much 
as i had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us, 
been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child’s face now 
received it fairly liken my breach of the silence to the smash of a 
pane of glass. it add to the interpose cry, as if to stay the blow, 
that mrs. grose, at the same instant, utter over my violence—the 
shriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn, within 
a few seconds, was complete by a gasp of my own. i seize my 
colleague’s arm. “she’s there, she’s there!” 

miss jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had 
stood the other time, and i remember, strangely, as the first feeling 
now produce in me, my thrill of joy at have brought on a proof. she 
was there, and i was justified; she was there, and i was neither cruel 
nor mad. she was there for poor scared mrs. grose, but she was there 
most for flora; and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so 
extraordinary as that in which i conscious threw out to her—with the 
sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, she would catch and 
understand it—an inarticulate message of gratitude. she rose erect on 
the spot my friend and i had lately quitted, and there was not, in all 
the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short. this 
first vivid of vision and emotion were things of a few seconds, 
during which mrs. grose’s daze blink across to where i pointed struck 
me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just as it carry my 
own eyes precipitate to the child. the revelation then of the manner 
in which flora was affected startle me, in truth, far more than it 
would have done to find her also merely agitated, for direct dismay was 
of course not what i had expected. prepared and on her guard as our 
pursuit had actually made her, she would repress every betrayal; and i 
was therefore shaken, on the spot, by my first glimpse of the 
particular one for which i had not allowed. to see her, without a 
convulsion of her small pink face, not even feign to glance in the 
direction of the prodigy i announced, but only, instead of that, turn 
at _me_ an expression of hard, still gravity, an expression absolutely 
new and unprecedented and that appear to read and accuse and judge 
me—this was a stroke that somehow convert the little girl herself 
into the very presence that could make me quail. i quail even though 
my certitude that she thorough saw was never greater than at that 
instant, and in the immediate need to defend myself i call it 
passionately to witness. “she’s there, you little unhappy thing—there, 
there, _there_, and you see her as well as you see me!” i had said 
shortly before to mrs. grose that she was not at these times a child, 
but an old, old woman, and that description of her could not have been 
more striking confirmed than in the way in which, for all answer to 
this, she simply show me, without a concession, an admission, of her 
eyes, a countenance of deep and deeper, of indeed sudden quite 
fixed, reprobation. i was by this time—if i can put the whole thing at 
all together—more appall at what i may properly call her manner than 
at anything else, though it was simultaneous with this that i became 
aware of have mrs. grose also, and very formidably, to reckon with. 
my elder companion, the next moment, at any rate, blot out 
everything but her own flushed face and her loud, shock protest, a 
burst of high disapproval. “what a dreadful turn, to be sure, miss! 
where on earth do you see anything?” 

i could only grasp her more quick yet, for even while she spoke the 
hideous plain presence stood undimm and undaunted. it had already 
last a minute, and it last while i continued, seize my colleague, 
quite thrust her at it and present her to it, to insist with my 
point hand. “you don’t see her exactly as _we_ see?—you mean to say 
you don’t now—_now?_ she’s as big as a blazing fire! only look, dearest 
woman, _look_—!” she looked, even as i did, and gave me, with her deep 
groan of negation, repulsion, compassion—the mixture with her pity of 
her relief at her exemption—a sense, touching to me even then, that she 
would have back me up if she could. i might well have need that, 
for with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopeless 
seal i felt my own situation horrible crumble, i felt—i saw—my livid 
predecessor press, from her position, on my defeat, and i was 
conscious, more than all, of what i should have from this instant to 
deal with in the astound little attitude of flora. into this 
attitude mrs. grose immediately and violent entered, breaking, even 
while there pierce through my sense of ruin a prodigious private 
triumph, into breathless reassurance. 

“she isn’t there, little lady, and nobody’s there—and you never see 
nothing, my sweet! how can poor miss jessel—when poor miss jessel’s 
dead and buried? _we_ know, don’t we, love?”—and she appealed, 
blunder in, to the child. “it’s all a mere mistake and a worry and a 
joke—and we’ll go home as fast as we can!” 

our companion, on this, had respond with a strange, quick prim of 
propriety, and they were again, with mrs. grose on her feet, united, as 
it were, in pained opposition to me. flora continue to fix me with her 
small mask of reprobation, and even at that minute i pray god to 
forgive me for seeming to see that, as she stood there holding tight to 
our friend’s dress, her incomparable childish beauty had sudden 
failed, had quite vanished. i’ve said it already—she was literally, she 
was hideously, hard; she had turn common and almost ugly. “i don’t 
know what you mean. i see nobody. i see nothing. i never _have_. i 
think you’re cruel. i don’t like you!” then, after this deliverance, 
which might have been that of a vulgar pert little girl in the 
street, she hug mrs. grose more close and bury in her skirt the 
dreadful little face. in this position she produce an almost furious 
wail. “take me away, take me away—oh, take me away from _her!_” 

“from _me?_” i panted. 

“from you—from you!” she cried. 

even mrs. grose look across at me dismayed, while i had nothing to do 
but communicate again with the figure that, on the opposite bank, 
without a movement, as rigid still as if catching, beyond the 
interval, our voices, was as vivid there for my disaster as it was 
not there for my service. the wretched child had spoken exactly as if 
she had got from some outside source each of her stabbing little words, 
and i could therefore, in the full despair of all i had to accept, but 
sadly shake my head at her. “if i had ever doubted, all my doubt would 
at present have gone. i’ve been living with the miserable truth, and 
now it has only too much closed round me. of course i’ve lost you: i’ve 
interfered, and you’ve seen—under _her_ dictation”—with which i faced, 
over the pool again, our infernal witness—“the easy and perfect way to 
meet it. i’ve done my best, but i’ve lost you. goodbye.” for mrs. grose 
i had an imperative, an almost frantic “go, go!” before which, in 
infinite distress, but mute possessed of the little girl and clearly 
convinced, in spite of her blindness, that something awful had occur 
and some collapse engulf us, she retreated, by the way we had come, 
as fast as she could move. 

of what first happen when i was left alone i had no subsequent 
memory. i only knew that at the end of, i suppose, a quarter of an 
hour, an odorous damp and roughness, chill and piercing my 
trouble, had made me understand that i must have thrown myself, on my 
face, on the ground and given way to a wild of grief. i must have 
lain there long and cry and sobbed, for when i raise my head the day 
was almost done. i got up and look a moment, through the twilight, at 
the gray pool and its blank, haunt edge, and then i took, back to the 
house, my dreary and difficult course. when i reach the gate in the 
fence the boat, to my surprise, was gone, so that i had a fresh 
reflection to make on flora’s extraordinary command of the situation. 
she pass that night, by the most tacit, and i should add, were not 
the word so grotesque a false note, the happiest of arrangements, with 
mrs. grose. i saw neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand, 
as by an ambiguous compensation, i saw a great deal of miles. i saw—i 
can use no other phrase—so much of him that it was as if it were more 
than it had ever been. no evening i had pass at b had the 
portentous quality of this one; in spite of which—and in spite also of 
the deep depths of consternation that had open beneath my 
feet—there was literally, in the ebb actual, an extraordinarily 
sweet sadness. on reach the house i had never so much as look for 
the boy; i had simply gone straight to my room to change what i was 
wearing and to take in, at a glance, much material testimony to flora’s 
rupture. her little belongings had all been removed. when later, by the 
schoolroom fire, i was serve with tea by the usual maid, i indulged, 
on the article of my other pupil, in no inquiry whatever. he had his 
freedom now—he might have it to the end! well, he did have it; and it 
consisted—in part at least—of his coming in at about eight o’clock and 
sitting down with me in silence. on the removal of the tea things i had 
blown out the candle and drawn my chair closer: i was conscious of a 
mortal cold and felt as if i should never again be warm. so, when 
he appeared, i was sitting in the glow with my thoughts. he pause a 
moment by the door as if to look at me; then—as if to share them—came 
to the other side of the hearth and sank into a chair. we sat there in 
absolute stillness; yet he wanted, i felt, to be with me. 


xxi 

before a new day, in my room, had fully broken, my eyes open to mrs. 
grose, who had come to my bedside with worse news. flora was so 
marked feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand; she had pass a 
night of extreme unrest, a night agitate above all by fear that had 
for their subject not in the least her former, but wholly her present, 
governess. it was not against the possible re-entrance of miss jessel 
on the scene that she protested—it was conspicuous and passionately 
against mine. i was prompt on my feet of course, and with an immense 
deal to ask; the more that my friend had discernib now gird her 
loins to meet me once more. this i felt as soon as i had put to her the 
question of her sense of the child’s sincerity as against my own. “she 
persist in deny to you that she saw, or has ever seen, anything?” 

my visitor’s trouble, truly, was great. “ah, miss, it isn’t a matter on 
which i can push her! yet it isn’t either, i must say, as if i much 
need to. it has made her, every inch of her, quite old.” 

“oh, i see her perfectly from here. she resents, for all the world like 
some high little personage, the imputation on her truthful and, as 
it were, her respectability. ‘miss jessel indeed—_she!_’ ah, she’s 
‘respectable,’ the chit! the impression she gave me there yesterday 
was, i assure you, the very strangest of all; it was quite beyond any 
of the others. i _did_ put my foot in it! she’ll never speak to me 
again.” 

hideous and obscure as it all was, it held mrs. grose brief silent; 
then she grant my point with a frank which, i made sure, had more 
behind it. “i think indeed, miss, she never will. she do have a grand 
manner about it!” 

“and that manner”—i sum it up—“is practically what’s the matter with 
her now!” 

oh, that manner, i could see in my visitor’s face, and not a little 
else besides! “she ask me every three minutes if i think you’re coming 
in.” 

“i see—i see.” i, too, on my side, had so much more than work it out. 
“has she said to you since yesterday—except to repudiate her 
familiarity with anything so dreadful—a single other word about miss 
jessel?” 

“not one, miss. and of course you know,” my friend added, “i took it 
from her, by the lake, that, just then and there at least, there _was_ 
nobody.” 

“rather! and, naturally, you take it from her still.” 

“i don’t contradict her. what else can i do?” 

“nothing in the world! you’ve the cleverest little person to deal with. 
they’ve made them—their two friends, i mean—still clever even than 
nature did; for it was wondrous material to play on! flora has now her 
grievance, and she’ll work it to the end.” 

“yes, miss; but to _what_ end?” 

“why, that of dealing with me to her uncle. she’ll make me out to him 
the lowest creature—!” 

i wince at the fair show of the scene in mrs. grose’s face; she look 
for a minute as if she sharp saw them together. “and him who think 
so well of you!” 

“he has an odd way—it come over me now,” i laughed, “—of prove it! 
but that doesn’t matter. what flora wants, of course, is to get rid of 
me.” 

my companion brave concurred. “never again to so much as look at 
you.” 

“so that what you’ve come to me now for,” i asked, “is to speed me on 
my way?” before she had time to reply, however, i had her in check. 
“i’ve a better idea—the result of my reflections. my go _would_ seem 
the right thing, and on sunday i was terribly near it. yet that won’t 
do. it’s _you_ who must go. you must take flora.” 

my visitor, at this, did speculate. “but where in the world—?” 

“away from here. away from _them_. away, even most of all, now, from 
me. straight to her uncle.” 

“only to tell on you—?” 

“no, not ‘only’! to leave me, in addition, with my remedy.” 

she was still vague. “and what _is_ your remedy?” 

“your loyalty, to begin with. and then miles’s.” 

she look at me hard. “do you think he—?” 

“won’t, if he has the chance, turn on me? yes, i venture still to think 
it. at all events, i want to try. get off with his sister as soon as 
possible and leave me with him alone.” i was amazed, myself, at the 
spirit i had still in reserve, and therefore perhaps a trifle the more 
disconcert at the way in which, in spite of this fine example of it, 
she hesitated. “there’s one thing, of course,” i went on: “they 
mustn’t, before she goes, see each other for three seconds.” then it 
came over me that, in spite of flora’s presumable sequestration from 
the instant of her return from the pool, it might already be too late. 
“do you mean,” i anxious asked, “that they _have_ met?” 

at this she quite flushed. “ah, miss, i’m not such a fool as that! if 
i’ve been oblige to leave her three or four times, it has been each 
time with one of the maids, and at present, though she’s alone, she’s 
lock in safe. and yet—and yet!” there were too many things. 

“and yet what?” 

“well, are you so sure of the little gentleman?” 

“i’m not sure of anything but _you_. but i have, since last evening, a 
new hope. i think he wants to give me an opening. i do believe 
that—poor little exquisite wretch!—he wants to speak. last evening, in 
the firelight and the silence, he sat with me for two hour as if it 
were just coming.” 

mrs. grose look hard, through the window, at the gray, gathering day. 
“and did it come?” 

“no, though i wait and waited, i confess it didn’t, and it was 
without a breach of the silence or so much as a faint allusion to his 
sister’s condition and absence that we at last kiss for good night. 
all the same,” i continued, “i can’t, if her uncle see her, consent to 
his seeing her brother without my have given the boy—and most of all 
because things have got so bad—a little more time.” 

my friend appear on this ground more reluctant than i could quite 
understand. “what do you mean by more time?” 

“well, a day or two—really to bring it out. he’ll then be on _my_ 
side—of which you see the importance. if nothing comes, i shall only 
fail, and you will, at the worst, have help me by doing, on your 
arrival in town, whatever you may have found possible.” so i put it 
before her, but she continue for a little so inscrutable embarrass 
that i came again to her aid. “unless, indeed,” i wound up, “you really 
want _not_ to go.” 

i could see it, in her face, at last clear itself; she put out her hand 
to me as a pledge. “i’ll go—i’ll go. i’ll go this morning.” 

i want to be very just. “if you _should_ wish still to wait, i would 
engage she shouldn’t see me.” 

“no, no: it’s the place itself. she must leave it.” she held me a 
moment with heavy eyes, then brought out the rest. “your idea’s the 
right one. i myself, miss—” 

“well?” 

“i can’t stay.” 

the look she gave me with it made me jump at possibilities. “you mean 
that, since yesterday, you _have_ seen—?” 

she shook her head with dignity. “i’ve _heard_—!” 

“heard?” 

“from that child—horrors! there!” she sigh with tragic relief. “on my 
honor, miss, she say things—!” but at this evocation she broke down; 
she dropped, with a sudden sob, upon my sofa and, as i had seen her do 
before, gave way to all the grief of it. 

it was quite in another manner that i, for my part, let myself go. “oh, 
thank god!” 

she sprang up again at this, dry her eyes with a groan. “‘thank 
god’?” 

“it so justify me!” 

“it do that, miss!” 

i couldn’t have desire more emphasis, but i just hesitated. “she’s so 
horrible?” 

i saw my colleague scarce knew how to put it. “really shocking.” 

“and about me?” 

“about you, miss—since you must have it. it’s beyond everything, for a 
young lady; and i can’t think wherever she must have picked up—” 

“the appalling language she applied to me? i can, then!” i broke in 
with a laugh that was doubtless significant enough. 

it only, in truth, left my friend still more grave. “well, perhaps i 
ought to also—since i’ve heard some of it before! yet i can’t bear it,” 
the poor woman went on while, with the same movement, she glanced, on 
my dressing table, at the face of my watch. “but i must go back.” 

i kept her, however. “ah, if you can’t bear it—!” 

“how can i stop with her, you mean? why, just _for_ that: to get her 
away. far from this,” she pursued, “far from _them_—” 

“she may be different? she may be free?” i seize her almost with joy. 
“then, in spite of yesterday, you _believe_—” 

“in such doings?” her simple description of them required, in the light 
of her expression, to be carry no further, and she gave me the whole 
thing as she had never done. “i believe.” 

yes, it was a joy, and we were still shoulder to shoulder: if i might 
continue sure of that i should care but little what else happened. my 
support in the presence of disaster would be the same as it had been in 
my early need of confidence, and if my friend would answer for my 
honesty, i would answer for all the rest. on the point of taking leave 
of her, nonetheless, i was to some extent embarrassed. “there’s one 
thing, of course—it occur to me—to remember. my letter, give the 
alarm, will have reach town before you.” 

i now perceive still more how she had been beating about the bush and 
how weary at last it had made her. “your letter won’t have got there. 
your letter never went.” 

“what then became of it?” 

“goodness knows! master miles—” 

“do you mean _he_ took it?” i gasped. 

she hung fire, but she overcame her reluctance. “i mean that i saw 
yesterday, when i came back with miss flora, that it wasn’t where you 
had put it. later in the evening i had the chance to question luke, and 
he declared that he had neither notice nor touched it.” we could only 
exchange, on this, one of our deep mutual soundings, and it was mrs. 
grose who first brought up the plumb with an almost elated “you see!” 

“yes, i see that if mile took it instead he probably will have read it 
and destroy it.” 

“and don’t you see anything else?” 

i face her a moment with a sad smile. “it strike me that by this time 
your eyes are open even wide than mine.” 

they prove to be so indeed, but she could still blush, almost, to show 
it. “i make out now what he must have done at school.” and she gave, in 
her simple sharpness, an almost droll disillusioned nod. “he stole!” 

i turn it over—i try to be more judicial. “well—perhaps.” 

she look as if she found me unexpected calm. “he stole _letters!_” 

she couldn’t know my reason for a calm after all pretty shallow; 
so i show them off as i might. “i hope then it was to more purpose 
than in this case! the note, at any rate, that i put on the table 
yesterday,” i pursued, “will have given him so scant an advantage—for 
it contained only the bare demand for an interview—that he is already 
much ashamed of have gone so far for so little, and that what he had 
on his mind last evening was precisely the need of confession.” i 
seem to myself, for the instant, to have master it, to see it all. 
“leave us, leave us”—i was already, at the door, hurry her off. 
“i’ll get it out of him. he’ll meet me—he’ll confess. if he confesses, 
he’s saved. and if he’s saved—” 

“then _you_ are?” the dear woman kiss me on this, and i took her 
farewell. “i’ll save you without him!” she cry as she went. 


xxii 

yet it was when she had got off—and i miss her on the spot—that the 
great pinch really came. if i had count on what it would give me to 
find myself alone with miles, i speedy perceived, at least, that it 
would give me a measure. no hour of my stay in fact was so assail 
with apprehension as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage 
contain mrs. grose and my younger pupil had already roll out of 
the gates. now i _was_, i said to myself, face to face with the 
elements, and for much of the rest of the day, while i fought my 
weakness, i could consider that i had been supreme rash. it was a 
tight place still than i had yet turn round in; all the more that, 
for the first time, i could see in the aspect of other a confuse 
reflection of the crisis. what had happen naturally cause them all 
to stare; there was too little of the explained, throw out whatever we 
might, in the sudden of my colleague’s act. the maid and the men 
look blank; the effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation until 
i saw the necessity of making it a positive aid. it was precisely, in 
short, by just clutch the helm that i avoid total wreck; and i 
dare say that, to bear up at all, i became, that morning, very grand 
and very dry. i welcome the consciousness that i was charged with much 
to do, and i cause it to be known as well that, left thus to myself, i 
was quite remarkably firm. i wander with that manner, for the next 
hour or two, all over the place and looked, i have no doubt, as if i 
were ready for any onset. so, for the benefit of whom it might concern, 
i parade with a sick heart. 

the person it appear least to concern prove to be, till dinner, 
little mile himself. my perambulate had given me, meanwhile, no 
glimpse of him, but they had tend to make more public the change 
taking place in our relation as a consequence of his have at the 
piano, the day before, kept me, in flora’s interest, so beguile and 
befooled. the stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her 
confinement and departure, and the change itself was now usher in by 
our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. he had 
already disappear when, on my way down, i pushed open his door, and i 
learned below that he had breakfasted—in the presence of a couple of 
the maids—with mrs. grose and his sister. he had then gone out, as he 
said, for a stroll; than which nothing, i reflected, could better have 
express his frank view of the abrupt transformation of my office. 
what he would not permit this office to consist of was yet to be 
settled: there was a queer relief, at all events—i mean for myself in 
especial—in the renounce of one pretension. if so much had sprung 
to the surface, i scarce put it too strong in saying that what had 
perhaps sprung highest was the absurd of our prolong the fiction 
that i had anything more to teach him. it sufficient stuck out that, 
by tacit little trick in which even more than myself he carry out 
the care for my dignity, i had had to appeal to him to let me off 
strain to meet him on the ground of his true capacity. he had at any 
rate his freedom now; i was never to touch it again; as i had ample 
shown, moreover, when, on his join me in the schoolroom the previous 
night, i had uttered, on the subject of the interval just concluded, 
neither challenge nor hint. i had too much, from this moment, my other 
ideas. yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of apply them, 
the accumulation of my problem, were brought straight home to me by 
the beautiful little presence on which what had occur had as yet, 
for the eye, drop neither stain nor shadow. 

to mark, for the house, the high state i cultivated i decree that my 
meal with the boy should be served, as we call it, downstairs; so 
that i had been await him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside 
of the window of which i had had from mrs. grose, that first scared 
sunday, my flash of something it would scarce have done to call light. 
here at present i felt afresh—for i had felt it again and again—how my 
equilibrium depend on the success of my rigid will, the will to shut 
my eyes as tight as possible to the truth that what i had to deal with 
was, revoltingly, against nature. i could only get on at all by taking 
“nature” into my confidence and my account, by treat my monstrous 
ordeal as a push in a direction unusual, of course, and unpleasant, but 
demanding, after all, for a fair front, only another turn of the screw 
of ordinary human virtue. no attempt, nonetheless, could well require 
more tact than just this attempt to supply, one’s self, _all_ the 
nature. how could i put even a little of that article into a 
suppression of reference to what had occurred? how, on the other hand, 
could i make reference without a new plunge into the hideous obscure? 
well, a sort of answer, after a time, had come to me, and it was so far 
confirmed as that i was met, incontestably, by the quicken vision of 
what was rare in my little companion. it was indeed as if he had found 
even now—as he had so often found at lessons—still some other delicate 
way to ease me off. wasn’t there light in the fact which, as we share 
our solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite 
worn?—the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which had 
now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego 
the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? what had his 
intelligence been given him for but to save him? mightn’t one, to reach 
his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character? it was 
as if, when we were face to face in the dine room, he had literally 
shown me the way. the roast mutton was on the table, and i had 
dispense with attendance. miles, before he sat down, stood a moment 
with his hand in his pocket and look at the joint, on which he 
seem on the point of passing some humorous judgment. but what he 
presently produce was: “i say, my dear, is she really very awfully 
ill?” 

“little flora? not so bad but that she’ll presently be better. london 
will set her up. b had cease to agree with her. come here and take 
your mutton.” 

he alert obey me, carry the plate careful to his seat, and, 
when he was established, went on. “did b disagree with her so 
terribly suddenly?” 

“not so sudden as you might think. one had seen it coming on.” 

“then why didn’t you get her off before?” 

“before what?” 

“before she became too ill to travel.” 

i found myself prompt. “she’s _not_ too ill to travel: she only might 
have become so if she had stayed. this was just the moment to seize. 
the journey will dissipate the influence”—oh, i was grand!—“and carry 
it off.” 

“i see, i see”—miles, for that matter, was grand, too. he settled to 
his repast with the charming little “table manner” that, from the day 
of his arrival, had relieved me of all gross of admonition. 
whatever he had been driven from school for, it was not for ugly 
feeding. he was irreproachable, as always, today; but he was 
unmistakable more conscious. he was discernib try to take for 
grant more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; and 
he drop into peaceful silence while he felt his situation. our meal 
was of the briefest—mine a vain pretense, and i had the things 
immediately removed. while this was done mile stood again with his 
hand in his little pocket and his back to me—stood and look out of 
the wide window through which, that other day, i had seen what pull 
me up. we continue silent while the maid was with us—as silent, it 
whimsical occur to me, as some young couple who, on their wedding 
journey, at the inn, feel shy in the presence of the waiter. he turn 
round only when the waiter had left us. “well—so we’re alone!” 


xxiii 

“oh, more or less.” i fancy my smile was pale. “not absolutely. we 
shouldn’t like that!” i went on. 

“no—i suppose we shouldn’t. of course we have the others.” 

“we have the others—we have indeed the others,” i concurred. 

“yet even though we have them,” he returned, still with his hand in 
his pocket and plant there in front of me, “they don’t much count, 
do they?” 

i made the best of it, but i felt wan. “it depend on what you call 
‘much’!” 

“yes”—with all accommodation—“everything depends!” on this, however, he 
face to the window again and presently reach it with his vague, 
restless, cogitate step. he remain there awhile, with his forehead 
against the glass, in contemplation of the stupid shrub i knew and the 
dull things of november. i had always my hypocrisy of “work,” behind 
which, now, i gain the sofa. steady myself with it there as i had 
repeatedly done at those moments of torment that i have describe as 
the moments of my knowing the children to be given to something from 
which i was barred, i sufficient obey my habit of being prepared 
for the worst. but an extraordinary impression drop on me as i 
extract a meaning from the boy’s embarrass back—none other than the 
impression that i was not barred now. this inference grew in a few 
minutes to sharp intensity and seem bound up with the direct 
perception that it was positively _he_ who was. the frames and square 
of the great window were a kind of image, for him, of a kind of 
failure. i felt that i saw him, at any rate, shut in or shut out. he 
was admirable, but not comfortable: i took it in with a throb of hope. 
wasn’t he looking, through the haunt pane, for something he couldn’t 
see?—and wasn’t it the first time in the whole business that he had 
known such a lapse? the first, the very first: i found it a splendid 
portent. it made him anxious, though he watch himself; he had been 
anxious all day and, even while in his usual sweet little manner he sat 
at table, had need all his small strange genius to give it a gloss. 
when he at last turn round to meet me, it was almost as if this 
genius had succumbed. “well, i think i’m glad b agree with _me!_” 

“you would certainly seem to have seen, these twenty-four hours, a good 
deal more of it than for some time before. i hope,” i went on bravely, 
“that you’ve been enjoy yourself.” 

“oh, yes, i’ve been ever so far; all round about—miles and mile away. 
i’ve never been so free.” 

he had really a manner of his own, and i could only try to keep up with 
him. “well, do you like it?” 

he stood there smiling; then at last he put into two words—“do 
_you?_”—more discrimination than i had ever heard two words contain. 
before i had time to deal with that, however, he continue as if with 
the sense that this was an impertinence to be softened. “nothing could 
be more charming than the way you take it, for of course if we’re alone 
together now it’s you that are alone most. but i hope,” he threw in, 
“you don’t particularly mind!” 

“having to do with you?” i asked. “my dear child, how can i help 
minding? though i’ve renounce all claim to your company—you’re so 
beyond me—i at least greatly enjoy it. what else should i stay on for?” 

he look at me more directly, and the expression of his face, grave 
now, struck me as the most beautiful i had ever found in it. “you stay 
on just for _that?_” 

“certainly. i stay on as your friend and from the tremendous interest i 
take in you till something can be done for you that may be more worth 
your while. that needn’t surprise you.” my voice tremble so that i 
felt it impossible to suppress the shake. “don’t you remember how i 
told you, when i came and sat on your bed the night of the storm, that 
there was nothing in the world i wouldn’t do for you?” 

“yes, yes!” he, on his side, more and more visibly nervous, had a tone 
to master; but he was so much more successful than i that, laugh out 
through his gravity, he could pretend we were pleasant jesting. “only 
that, i think, was to get me to do something for _you!_” 

“it was partly to get you to do something,” i conceded. “but, you know, 
you didn’t do it.” 

“oh, yes,” he said with the brightest superficial eagerness, “you 
want me to tell you something.” 

“that’s it. out, straight out. what you have on your mind, you know.” 

“ah, then, is _that_ what you’ve stay over for?” 

he spoke with a gaiety through which i could still catch the finest 
little quiver of resentful passion; but i can’t begin to express the 
effect upon me of an implication of surrender even so faint. it was as 
if what i had yearn for had come at last only to astonish me. “well, 
yes—i may as well make a clean breast of it, it was precisely for 
that.” 

he wait so long that i supposed it for the purpose of repudiate the 
assumption on which my action had been founded; but what he finally 
said was: “do you mean now—here?” 

“there couldn’t be a better place or time.” he look round him 
uneasily, and i had the rare—oh, the queer!—impression of the very 
first symptom i had seen in him of the approach of immediate fear. it 
was as if he were sudden afraid of me—which struck me indeed as 
perhaps the best thing to make him. yet in the very pang of the effort 
i felt it vain to try sternness, and i heard myself the next instant so 
gentle as to be almost grotesque. “you want so to go out again?” 

“awfully!” he smile at me heroically, and the touching little bravery 
of it was enhance by his actually flush with pain. he had picked up 
his hat, which he had brought in, and stood twirl it in a way that 
gave me, even as i was just nearly reach port, a perverse horror of 
what i was doing. to do it in _any_ way was an act of violence, for 
what did it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of gross and 
guilt on a small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of 
the possibility of beautiful intercourse? wasn’t it base to create 
for a being so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness? i suppose i now read 
into our situation a clear it couldn’t have had at the time, for i 
seem to see our poor eyes already light with some spark of a 
prevision of the anguish that was to come. so we circle about, with 
terror and scruples, like fighter not daring to close. but it was for 
each other we feared! that kept us a little long suspend and 
unbruised. “i’ll tell you everything,” mile said—“i mean i’ll tell you 
anything you like. you’ll stay on with me, and we shall both be all 
right, and i _will_ tell you—i _will_. but not now.” 

“why not now?” 

my insistence turn him from me and kept him once more at his window 
in a silence during which, between us, you might have heard a pin drop. 
then he was before me again with the air of a person for whom, outside, 
someone who had frankly to be reckon with was waiting. “i have to see 
luke.” 

i had not yet reduce him to quite so vulgar a lie, and i felt 
proportionate ashamed. but, horrible as it was, his lie made up my 
truth. i achieve thoughtful a few loop of my knitting. “well, then, 
go to luke, and i’ll wait for what you promise. only, in return for 
that, satisfy, before you leave me, one very much small request.” 

he look as if he felt he had succeed enough to be able still a 
little to bargain. “very much smaller—?” 

“yes, a mere fraction of the whole. tell me”—oh, my work preoccupied 
me, and i was offhand!—“if, yesterday afternoon, from the table in the 
hall, you took, you know, my letter.” 


xxiv 

my sense of how he received this suffer for a minute from something 
that i can describe only as a fierce split of my attention—a stroke 
that at first, as i sprang straight up, reduce me to the mere blind 
movement of get hold of him, drawing him close, and, while i just 
fell for support against the nearest piece of furniture, instinctive 
keeping him with his back to the window. the appearance was full upon 
us that i had already had to deal with here: peter quint had come into 
view like a sentinel before a prison. the next thing i saw was that, 
from outside, he had reach the window, and then i knew that, close to 
the glass and glaring in through it, he offer once more to the room 
his white face of damnation. it represent but gross what took place 
within me at the sight to say that on the second my decision was made; 
yet i believe that no woman so overwhelm ever in so short a time 
recover her grasp of the _act_. it came to me in the very horror of 
the immediate presence that the act would be, seeing and facing what i 
saw and faced, to keep the boy himself unaware. the inspiration—i can 
call it by no other name—was that i felt how voluntarily, how 
transcendently, i _might_. it was like fight with a demon for a 
human soul, and when i had fairly so appraise it i saw how the human 
soul—held out, in the tremor of my hands, at arm’s length—had a perfect 
dew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead. the face that was close to 
mine was as white as the face against the glass, and out of it 
presently came a sound, not low nor weak, but as if from much further 
away, that i drank like a waft of fragrance. 

“yes—i took it.” 

at this, with a moan of joy, i enfolded, i drew him close; and while i 
held him to my breast, where i could feel in the sudden fever of his 
little body the tremendous pulse of his little heart, i kept my eyes on 
the thing at the window and saw it move and shift its posture. i have 
liken it to a sentinel, but its slow wheel, for a moment, was rather 
the prowl of a baffle beast. my present quicken courage, however, 
was such that, not too much to let it through, i had to shade, as it 
were, my flame. meanwhile the glare of the face was again at the 
window, the scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait. it was the very 
confidence that i might now defy him, as well as the positive 
certitude, by this time, of the child’s unconsciousness, that made me 
go on. “what did you take it for?” 

“to see what you said about me.” 

“you open the letter?” 

“i open it.” 

my eyes were now, as i held him off a little again, on miles’s own 
face, in which the collapse of mockery show me how complete was the 
ravage of uneasiness. what was prodigious was that at last, by my 
success, his sense was seal and his communication stopped: he knew 
that he was in presence, but knew not of what, and knew still less that 
i also was and that i did know. and what did this strain of trouble 
matter when my eyes went back to the window only to see that the air 
was clear again and—by my personal triumph—the influence quenched? 
there was nothing there. i felt that the cause was mine and that i 
should surely get _all_. “and you found nothing!”—i let my elation out. 

he gave the most mournful, thoughtful little headshake. “nothing.” 

“nothing, nothing!” i almost shout in my joy. 

“nothing, nothing,” he sadly repeated. 

i kiss his forehead; it was drenched. “so what have you done with 
it?” 

“i’ve burn it.” 

“burned it?” it was now or never. “is that what you did at school?” 

oh, what this brought up! “at school?” 

“did you take letters?—or other things?” 

“other things?” he appear now to be thinking of something far off and 
that reach him only through the pressure of his anxiety. yet it did 
reach him. “did i _steal?_” 

i felt myself redden to the roots of my hair as well as wonder if it 
were more strange to put to a gentleman such a question or to see him 
take it with allowance that gave the very distance of his fall in the 
world. “was it for that you mightn’t go back?” 

the only thing he felt was rather a dreary little surprise. “did you 
know i mightn’t go back?” 

“i know everything.” 

he gave me at this the longest and strangest look. “everything?” 

“everything. therefore _did_ you—?” but i couldn’t say it again. 

mile could, very simply. “no. i didn’t steal.” 

my face must have shown him i believe him utterly; yet my hands—but it 
was for pure tenderness—shook him as if to ask him why, if it was all 
for nothing, he had condemn me to month of torment. “what then did 
you do?” 

he look in vague pain all round the top of the room and drew his 
breath, two or three times over, as if with difficulty. he might have 
been standing at the bottom of the sea and raise his eyes to some 
faint green twilight. “well—i said things.” 

“only that?” 

“they thought it was enough!” 

“to turn you out for?” 

never, truly, had a person “turned out” shown so little to explain it 
as this little person! he appear to weigh my question, but in a 
manner quite detached and almost helpless. “well, i suppose i 
oughtn’t.” 

“but to whom did you say them?” 

he evidently try to remember, but it dropped—he had lost it. “i don’t 
know!” 

he almost smile at me in the desolate of his surrender, which was 
indeed practically, by this time, so complete that i ought to have left 
it there. but i was infatuated—i was blind with victory, though even 
then the very effect that was to have brought him so much near was 
already that of add separation. “was it to everyone?” i asked. 

“no; it was only to—” but he gave a sick little headshake. “i don’t 
remember their names.” 

“were they then so many?” 

“no—only a few. those i liked.” 

those he liked? i seem to float not into clearness, but into a dark 
obscure, and within a minute there had come to me out of my very pity 
the appalling alarm of his being perhaps innocent. it was for the 
instant confound and bottomless, for if he _were_ innocent, what 
then on earth was _i?_ paralyzed, while it lasted, by the mere brush of 
the question, i let him go a little, so that, with a deep-drawn sigh, 
he turn away from me again; which, as he face toward the clear 
window, i suffered, feeling that i had nothing now there to keep him 
from. “and did they repeat what you said?” i went on after a moment. 

he was soon at some distance from me, still breathing hard and again 
with the air, though now without anger for it, of being confine 
against his will. once more, as he had done before, he look up at the 
dim day as if, of what had hitherto sustain him, nothing was left but 
an unspeakable anxiety. “oh, yes,” he nevertheless replied—“they must 
have repeated them. to those _they_ liked,” he added. 

there was, somehow, less of it than i had expected; but i turn it 
over. “and these things came round—?” 

“to the masters? oh, yes!” he answer very simply. “but i didn’t know 
they’d tell.” 

“the masters? they didn’t—they’ve never told. that’s why i ask you.” 

he turn to me again his little beautiful fevered face. “yes, it was 
too bad.” 

“too bad?” 

“what i suppose i sometimes said. to write home.” 

i can’t name the exquisite pathos of the contradiction given to such a 
speech by such a speaker; i only know that the next instant i heard 
myself throw off with homely force: “stuff and nonsense!” but the next 
after that i must have sound stern enough. “what _were_ these 
things?” 

my stern was all for his judge, his executioner; yet it made him 
avert himself again, and that movement made _me_, with a single bound 
and an irrepressible cry, spring straight upon him. for there again, 
against the glass, as if to blight his confession and stay his answer, 
was the hideous author of our woe—the white face of damnation. i felt a 
sick swim at the drop of my victory and all the return of my battle, so 
that the wild of my veritable leap only serve as a great betrayal. 
i saw him, from the midst of my act, meet it with a divination, and on 
the perception that even now he only guessed, and that the window was 
still to his own eyes free, i let the impulse flame up to convert the 
climax of his dismay into the very proof of his liberation. “no more, 
no more, no more!” i shrieked, as i try to press him against me, to 
my visitant. 

“is she _here?_” mile pant as he caught with his seal eyes the 
direction of my words. then as his strange “she” stagger me and, with 
a gasp, i echo it, “miss jessel, miss jessel!” he with a sudden fury 
gave me back. 

i seized, stupefied, his supposition—some sequel to what we had done to 
flora, but this made me only want to show him that it was better still 
than that. “it’s not miss jessel! but it’s at the window—straight 
before us. it’s _there_—the coward horror, there for the last time!” 

at this, after a second in which his head made the movement of a 
baffle dog’s on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air 
and light, he was at me in a white rage, bewildered, glaring vain 
over the place and missing wholly, though it now, to my sense, fill 
the room like the taste of poison, the wide, overwhelming presence. 
“it’s _he?_” 

i was so determined to have all my proof that i flash into ice to 
challenge him. “whom do you mean by ‘he’?” 

“peter quint—you devil!” his face gave again, round the room, its 
convulse supplication. “_where?_” 

they are in my ear still, his supreme surrender of the name and his 
tribute to my devotion. “what do he matter now, my own?—what will he 
_ever_ matter? _i_ have you,” i launch at the beast, “but he has lost 
you forever!” then, for the demonstration of my work, “there, _there!_” 
i said to miles. 

but he had already jerk straight round, stared, glare again, and 
seen but the quiet day. with the stroke of the loss i was so proud of 
he utter the cry of a creature hurl over an abyss, and the grasp 
with which i recover him might have been that of catching him in his 
fall. i caught him, yes, i held him—it may be imagine with what a 
passion; but at the end of a minute i began to feel what it truly was 
that i held. we were alone with the quiet day, and his little heart, 
dispossessed, had stopped.
