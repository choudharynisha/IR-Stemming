the mummy's foot 

by théophile gautier 

translate by lafcadio hearn 

1908 


i had entered, in an idle mood, the shop of one of those curiosity 
vender who are call _marchands de bric-à-brac_ in that parisian 
_argot_ which is so perfectly unintelligible elsewhere in france. 

you have doubtless glance occasional through the window of some of 
these shops, which have become so numerous now that it is fashionable 
to buy antiquated furniture, and that every petty stockbroker think he 
must have his _chambre au moyen âge_. 

there is one thing there which cling alike to the shop of the dealer 
in old iron, the ware-room of the tapestry maker, the laboratory of the 
chemist, and the studio of the painter: in all those gloomy den where 
a furtive daylight filter in through the window-shutters the most 
manifest ancient thing is dust. the cobweb are more authentic 
than the gimp laces, and the old pear-tree furniture on exhibition is 
actually younger than the mahogany which arrive but yesterday from 
america. 

the warehouse of my bric-à-brac dealer was a veritable capharnaum. all 
age and all nation seem to have made their rendezvous there. an 
etruscan lamp of red clay stood upon a boule cabinet, with ebony panels, 
bright striped by lines of inlaid brass; a duchess of the court of 
louis xv. nonchalant extend her fawn-like feet under a massive 
table of the time of louis xiii., with heavy spiral support of oak, and 
carven designs of chimera and foliage intermingled. 

upon the denticulate shelves of several sideboards glitter immense 
japan dishes with red and blue designs relieved by gilded hatching, 
side by side with enamel works by bernard palissy, represent 
serpents, frogs, and lizard in relief. 

from disembowel cabinet escape cascade of silver-lustrous china 
silk and wave of tinsel, which an oblique sunbeam shot through with 
luminous beads, while portrait of every era, in frames more or less 
tarnished, smile through their yellow varnish. 

the striped breastplate of a damascene suit of milanese armour 
glitter in one corner; love and nymph of porcelain, china 
grotesques, vase of _céladon_ and crackleware, saxon and old sèvres 
cup encumber the shelves and nook of the apartment. 

the dealer follow me close through the tortuous way contrived 
between the piles of furniture, ward off with his hand the hazardous 
sweep of my coat-skirts, watch my elbow with the uneasy attention of 
an antiquarian and a usurer. 

it was a singular face, that of the merchant; an immense skull, polish 
like a knee, and surround by a thin aureole of white hair, which 
brought out the clear salmon tint of his complexion all the more 
strikingly, lent him a false aspect of patriarchal _bonhomie_, 
counteracted, however, by the scintillate of two little yellow eyes 
which tremble in their orbit like two louis-d'or upon quicksilver. the 
curve of his nose present an aquiline silhouette, which suggest the 
oriental or jewish type. his hands--thin, slender, full of nerves which 
project like strings upon the finger-board of a violin, and armed with 
claw like those on the termination of bats' wings--shook with senile 
trembling; but those convulsive agitate hand became firm 
than steel pincers or lobsters' claw when they lift any precious 
article--an onyx cup, a venetian glass, or a dish of bohemian crystal. 
this strange old man had an aspect so thorough rabbinical and 
cabalistic that he would have been burnt on the mere testimony of his 
face three century ago. 

'will you not buy something from me to-day, sir? here is a malay kreese 
with a blade undulate like flame. look at those groove contrived for 
the blood to run along, those teeth set backward so as to tear out the 
entrails in withdraw the weapon. it is a fine character of ferocious 
arm, and will look well in your collection. this two-handed sword 
is very beautiful. it is the work of josepe de la hera; and this 
_colichemarde_ with its fenestrate guard--what a superb specimen of 
handicraft!' 

'no; i have quite enough weapon and instrument of carnage. i want a 
small figure,--something which will suit me as a paper-weight, for i 
cannot endure those trumpery bronze which the stationer sell, and 
which may be found on everybody's desk.' 

the old gnome forage among his ancient wares, and finally arrange 
before me some antique bronzes, so-called at least; fragment of 
malachite, little hindoo or china idols, a kind of poussah-toys in 
jade-stone, represent the incarnation of brahma or vishnoo, and 
wonderful appropriate to the very undivine office of holding papers 
and letters in place. 

i was hesitate between a porcelain dragon, all constellate with 
warts, its mouth formidable with bristle tusk and range of 
teeth, and an abominable little mexico fetich, represent the god 
vitziliputzili _au naturel_, when i caught sight of a charming foot, 
which i at first took for a fragment of some antique venus. 

it had those beautiful ruddy and tawny tint that lend to florentine 
bronze that warm living look so much preferable to the gray-green aspect 
of common bronzes, which might easily be mistaken for statue in a state 
of putrefaction. satiny gleam play over its round forms, doubtless 
polish by the amorous kiss of twenty centuries, for it seem a 
corinthian bronze, a work of the best era of art, perhaps mould by 
lysippu himself. 

'that foot will be my choice,' said to the merchant, who regard me 
with an ironic and saturnine air, and held out the object desire that 
i might examine it more fully. 

i was surprise at its lightness. it was not a foot of metal, but in 
sooth a foot of flesh, an embalm foot, a mummy's foot. on examine 
it still more close the very grain of the skin, and the almost 
imperceptible lines impress upon it by the texture of the bandages, 
became perceptible. the toe were slender and delicate, and terminate 
by perfectly form nails, pure and transparent as agates. the great 
toe, slightly separate from the rest, afford a happy contrast, in the 
antique style, to the position of the other toes, and lent it an aerial 
lightness--the grace of a bird's foot. the sole, scarcely streak by 
a few almost imperceptible cross lines, afford evidence that it had 
never touched the bare ground, and had only come in contact with the 
finest matting of nile rushes and the softest carpet of panther skin. 

'ha, ha, you want the foot of the princess hermonthis!' exclaim the 
merchant, with a strange giggle, fix his owlish eyes upon me. 'ha, 
ha, ha! for a paper-weight! an original idea!--artistic idea!-old 
pharaoh would certainly have been surprise had some one told him that 
the foot of his adore daughter would be use for a paper-weight after 
he had had a mountain of granite hollow out as a receptacle for 
the triple coffin, paint and gilded, cover with hieroglyphics and 
beautiful painting of the judgment of souls,' continue the queer 
little merchant, half audibly, as though talk to himself. 

'how much will you charge me for this mummy fragment?' 

'ah, the highest price i can get, for it is a superb piece. if i had the 
match of it you could not have it for less than five hundred francs. the 
daughter of a pharaoh! nothing is more rare.' 

'assuredly that is not a common article, but still, how much do you 
want? in the first place let me warn you that all my wealth consist of 
just five louis. i can buy anything that costs five louis, but nothing 
dearer. you might search my vest pocket and most secret drawers without 
even finding one poor five-franc piece more.' 

'five louis for the foot of the princess hermonthis! that is very 
little, very little indeed. 'tis an authentic foot,' mutter the 
merchant, shake his head, and impart a peculiar rotary motion to 
his eyes. 'well, take it, and i will give you the bandage into the 
bargain,' he added, wrapping the foot in an ancient damask rag. 'very 
fine? real damask--indian damask which has never been redyed. it is 
strong, and yet it is soft,' he mumbled, stroke the fray tissue with 
his fingers, through the trade-acquired habit which move him to praise 
even an object of such little value that he himself deem it only worth 
the give away. 

he pour the gold coin into a sort of mediaeval alms-purse hanging at 
his belt, repeating: 

'the foot of the princess hermonthi to be use for a paper-weight!' 

then turning his phosphorescent eyes upon me, he exclaim in a voice 
strident as the crying of a cat which has swallow a fish-bone: 

'old pharaoh will not be well pleased. he love his daughter, the dear 
man!' 

'you speak as if you were a contemporary of his. you are old enough, 
goodness knows! but you do not date back to the pyramid of egypt,' i 
answered, laughingly, from the threshold. 

i went home, delight with my acquisition. 

with the idea of putt it to profitable use as soon as possible, i 
placed the foot of the divine princess hermonthi upon a heap of papers 
scribble over with verses, in themselves an undecipherable mosaic work 
of erasures; articles freshly begun; letters forgotten, and post 
in the table drawer instead of the letter-box, an error to which 
absent-minded people are peculiarly liable. the effect was charming, 
_bizarre_, and romantic. 

well satisfy with this embellishment, i went out with the gravity and 
pride becoming one who feel that he has the ineffable advantage over 
all the passers-by whom he elbows, of possess a piece of the princess 
hermonthis, daughter of pharaoh. 

i look upon all who did not possess, like myself, a paper-weight so 
authentic egypt as very ridiculous people, and it seem to me 
that the proper occupation of every sensible man should consist in the 
mere fact of have a mummy's foot upon his desk. 

happily i met some friends, whose presence distracted me in my 
infatuation with this new acquisition. i went to dinner with them, for i 
could not very well have dine with myself. 

when i came back that evening, with my brain slightly confuse by a few 
glasses of wine, a vague whiff of oriental perfume delicate titillate 
my olfactory nerves. the heat of the room had warm the natron, 
bitumen, and myrrh in which the _paraschistes_, who cut open the body 
of the dead, had bath the corpse of the princess. it was a perfume at 
once sweet and penetrating, a perfume that four thousand years had not 
been able to dissipate. 

the dream of egypt was eternity. her odour have the solidity of granite 
and endure as long. 

i soon drank deep from the black cup of sleep. for a few hour all 
remain opaque to me. oblivion and nothingness inundate me with their 
sombre waves. 

yet light gradual dawn upon the dark of my mind. dream 
commence to touch me soft in their silent flight. 

the eyes of my soul were opened, and i beheld my chamber as it actually 
was. i might have believe myself awake but for a vague consciousness 
which assured me that i slept, and that something fantastic was about to 
take place. 

the odour of the myrrh had augment in intensity, and i felt a slight 
headache, which i very naturally attribute to several glasses of 
champagne that we had drunk to the unknown gods and our future fortunes. 

i peer through my room with a feeling of expectation which i saw 
nothing to justify. every article of furniture was in its proper place. 
the lamp, soft shade by its globe of ground crystal, burn upon its 
bracket; the water-colour sketch shone under their bohemian glass; 
the curtains hung down languidly; everything wore an aspect of tranquil 
slumber. 

after a few moments, however, all this calm interior appear to become 
disturbed. the woodwork cracked stealthily, the ash-covered log sudden 
emit a jet of blue flame, and the disc of the patera seem like 
great metallic eyes, watching, like myself, for the things which were 
about to happen. 

my eyes accidental fell upon the desk where i had placed the foot of 
the princess hermonthis. 

instead of remain quiet, as behove a foot which had been embalm 
for four thousand years, it commence to act in a nervous manner, 
contract itself, and leap over the papers like a startle frog. one 
would have imagine that it had sudden been brought into contact with 
a galvanic battery. i could distinct hear the dry sound made by its 
little heel, hard as the hoof of a gazelle. 

i became rather discontented with my acquisition, inasmuch as i wish 
my paper-weights to be of a sedentary disposition, and thought it very 
unnatural that feet should walk about without legs, and i commence to 
experience a feeling close akin to fear. 

sudden i saw the fold of my bed-curtain stir, and heard a bump 
sound, like that cause by some person hop on one foot across the 
floor. i must confess i became alternate hot and cold, that i felt a 
strange wind chill my back, and that my sudden rising hair cause my 
night-cap to execute a leap of several yards. 

the bed-curtains open and i beheld the strangest figure imaginable 
before me. 

it was a young girl of a very deep coffee-brown complexion, like the 
bayadère amani, and possess the purest egypt type of perfect 
beauty. her eyes were almond shaped and oblique, with eyebrow so black 
that they seem blue; her nose was exquisite chiselled, almost greece 
in its delicacy of outline; and she might indeed have been taken for a 
corinthian statue of bronze but for the prominence of her cheek-bones 
and the slightly africa fulness of her lips, which compel one to 
recognise her as belong beyond all doubt to the hieroglyph race 
which dwelt upon the bank of the nile. 

her arms, slender and spindle-shaped like those of very young girls, 
were encircle by a peculiar kind of metal band and bracelets of glass 
beads; her hair was all twist into little cords, and she wore upon 
her bosom a little idol-figure of green paste, bearing a whip with seven 
lashes, which prove it to be an image of isis; her brow was adorn 
with a shining plate of gold, and a few trace of paint relieved the 
coppery tint of her cheeks. 

as for her costume, it was very odd indeed. 

fancy a _pagne_, or skirt, all form of little strip of material 
bedizene with red and black hieroglyphics, stiffen with bitumen, and 
apparently belong to a freshly unbandaged mummy. 

in one of those sudden flight of thought so common in dream i 
heard the hoarse falsetto of the bric-à-brac dealer, repeating like 
a monotonous refrain the phrase he had utter in his shop with so 
enigmatic an intonation: 

'old pharaoh will not be well pleased he love his daughter, the dear 
man!' 

one strange circumstance, which was not at all calculate to restore 
my equanimity, was that the apparition had but one foot; the other was 
broken off at the ankle! 

she approach the table where the foot was start and fidget about 
more than ever, and there support herself upon the edge of the desk. i 
saw her eyes fill with pearly gleam tears. 

although she had not as yet spoken, i fully comprehend the thought 
which agitate her. she look at her foot--for it was indeed her 
own--with an exquisite graceful expression of coquettish sadness, but 
the foot leap and ran hither and thither, as though impel on steel 
springs. 

twice or thrice she extend her hand to seize it, but could not 
succeed. 

then commence between the princess hermonthi and her foot--which 
appear to be endow with a special life of its own--a very fantastic 
dialogue in a most ancient coptic tongue, such as might have been spoken 
thirty century ago in the syrinxe of the land of ser. lucky i 
understood coptic perfectly well that night. 

the princess hermonthi cried, in a voice sweet and vibrant as the tone 
of a crystal bell: 

'well, my dear little foot, you always flee from me, yet i always 
took good care of you. i bath you with perfume water in a bowl of 
alabaster; i smooth your heel with pumice-stone mixed with 
palm-oil; your nail were cut with golden scissors and polish with a 
hippopotamus tooth; i was careful to select _tatbebs_ for you, paint 
and embroider and turn up at the toes, which were the envy of all 
the young girl in egypt. you wore on your great toe ring bearing the 
device of the sacred scarabseus, and you support one of the lightest 
body that a lazy foot could sustain.' 

the foot reply in a pout and chagrin tone: 

'you know well that i do not belong to myself any longer. i have been 
bought and paid for. the old merchant knew what he was about. he bore 
you a grudge for have refuse to espouse him. this is an ill turn 
which he has done you. the arab who violate your royal coffin in the 
subterranean pit of the necropolis of thebe was sent thither by him. 
he desire to prevent you from being present at the reunion of the 
shadowy nation in the city below. have you five pieces of gold for my 
ransom?' 

'alas, no! my jewels, my rings, my purse of gold and silver were all 
stolen from me,' answer the princess hermonthi with a sob. 

'princess,' i then exclaimed, 'i never retain anybody's foot unjustly. 
even though you have not got the five louis which it cost me, i present 
it to you gladly. i should feel unutterable wretched to think that i 
were the cause of so amiable a person as the princess hermonthi being 
lame.' 

i deliver this discourse in a royal gallant, troubadour tone which 
must have astonish the beautiful egypt girl. 

she turn a look of deepest gratitude upon me, and her eyes shone with 
bluish gleam of light. 

she took her foot, which surrender itself willing this time, like a 
woman about to put on her little shoe, and adjust it to her leg with 
much skill. 

this operation over, she took a few steps about the room, as though to 
assure herself that she was really no long lame. 

'ah, how pleased my father will be! he who was so unhappy because of my 
mutilation, and who from the moment of my birth set a whole nation at 
work to hollow me out a tomb so deep that he might preserve me intact 
until that last day when soul must be weigh in the balance of 
amenthi! come with me to my father. he will receive you kindly, for you 
have given me back my foot.' 

i thought this proposition natural enough. i array myself in a 
dressing-gown of large-flowered pattern, which lent me a very pharaonic 
aspect, hurried put on a pair of turkey slippers, and informed the 
princess hermonthi that i was ready to follow her. 

before starting, hermonthi took from her neck the little idol of green 
paste, and laid it on the scattered sheet of paper which cover the 
table. 

'it is only fair,' she observed, smilingly, 'that i should replace your 
paper-weight.' 

she gave me her hand, which felt soft and cold, like the skin of a 
serpent, and we departed. 

we pass for some time with the velocity of an arrow through a fluid 
and grayish expanse, in which half-formed silhouette flit swift by 
us, to right and left. 

for an instant we saw only sky and sea. 

a few moments later obelisk commence to tower in the distance; pylon 
and vast flight of steps guarded by sphinx became clearly outline 
against the horizon. 

we had reach our destination. 

the princess conduct me to a mountain of rose-coloured granite, in the 
face of which appear an opening so narrow and low that it would have 
been difficult to distinguish it from the fissure in the rock, had not 
its location been marked by two stelae wrought with sculptures. 

hermonthi kindle a torch and led the way before me. 

we traverse corridor hewn through the living rock. their walls, 
cover with hieroglyphics and painting of allegorical processions, 
might well have occupy thousand of arms for thousand of years in 
their formation. these corridor of interminable length open into 
square chambers, in the midst of which pit had been contrived, through 
which we descended by cramp-irons or spiral stairways. these pit again 
conduct us into other chambers, opening into other corridors, likewise 
decorate with paint sparrow-hawks, serpent coil in circles, the 
symbol of the _tau_ and _pedum_--prodigious works of art which no 
living eye can ever examine--interminable legend of granite which only 
the dead have time to read through all eternity. 

at last we found ourselves in a hall so vast, so enormous, so 
immeasurable, that the eye could not reach its limits. file of 
monstrous column stretch far out of sight on every side, between 
which twinkle livid stars of yellowish flame; points of light which 
reveal further depths incalculable in the dark beyond. 

the princess hermonthi still held my hand, and gracious salute the 
mummy of her acquaintance. 

my eyes became accustomed to the dim twilight, and object became 
discernible. 

i beheld the kings of the subterranean races seat upon thrones--grand 
old men, though dry, withered, wrinkle like parchment, and blacken 
with naphtha and bitumen--all wearing _pshents_ of gold, and 
breastplate and gorget glittering with precious stones, their eyes 
immovable fixed like the eyes of sphinxes, and their long beard 
whiten by the snow of centuries. behind them stood their peoples, 
in the stiff and constrained posture enjoin by egypt art, all 
eternal preserve the attitude prescribed by the hieratic code. 
behind these nations, the cats, ibixes, and crocodile contemporary 
with them--rendered monstrous of aspect by their swathe bands--mewed, 
flap their wings, or extend their jaws in a saurian giggle. 

all the pharaoh were there--cheops, chephrenes, psammetichus, 
sesostris, amenotaph--all the dark ruler of the pyramid and syrinxes. 
on yet higher throne sat chrono and xixouthros, who was contemporary 
with the deluge, and tub cain, who reign before it. 

the beard of king xixouthro had grown seven times around the granite 
table upon which he leaned, lost in deep reverie, and bury in dreams. 

further back, through a dusty cloud, i beheld dim the seventy-two 
pre-adamite kings, with their seventy-two peoples, for ever pass away. 

after permit me to gaze upon this bewilder spectacle a few 
moments, the princess hermonthi present me to her father pharaoh, who 
favoured me with a most gracious nod. 

'i have found my foot again! i have found my foot!' cry the princess, 
clap her little hand together with every sign of frantic joy. 'it 
was this gentleman who restore it to me.' 

the races of kemi, the races of nahasi--all the black, bronzed, and 
copper-coloured nation repeated in chorus: 

'the princess hermonthi has found her foot again!' 

even xixouthro himself was visibly affected. 

he raise his heavy eyelids, stroke his moustache with his fingers, and 
turn upon me a glance weighty with centuries. 

'by oms, the dog of hell, and tmei, daughter of the sun and of truth, 
this is a brave and worthy lad!' exclaim pharaoh, point to me with 
his sceptre, which was terminate with a lotus-flower. 

'what recompense do you desire?' 

fill with that daring inspired by dream in which nothing seem 
impossible, i ask him for the hand of the princess hermonthis. the 
hand seem to me a very proper antithetic recompense for the foot. 

pharaoh open wide his great eyes of glass in astonishment at my witty 
request. 

'what country do you come from, and what is your age?' 

'i am a frenchman, and i am twenty-seven years old venerable pharaoh.' 

'twenty-seven years old, and he wish to espouse the princess 
hermonthi who is thirty century old!' cry out at once all the 
throne and all the circle of nations. 

only hermonthi herself did not seem to think my request unreasonable. 

'if you were even only two thousand years old,' reply the ancient 
king, 'i would willing give you the princess, but the disproportion 
is too great; and, besides, we must give our daughter husband who will 
last well. you do not know how to preserve yourself any longer. even 
those who die only fifteen century ago are already no more than a 
handful of dust. behold, my flesh is solid as basalt, my bone are bar 
of steel! 

'i will be present on the last day of the world with the same body and 
the same features which i had during my lifetime. my daughter hermonthi 
will last long than a statue of bronze. 

'then the last particle of your dust will have been scattered abroad 
by the winds, and even isi herself, who was able to find the atom of 
osiris, would scarce be able to recompose your being. 

'see how vigorous i yet remain, and how mighty is my grasp,' he added, 
shake my hand in the english fashion with a strength that bury my 
ring in the flesh of my fingers. 

he squeeze me so hard that i awoke, and found my friend alfred shake 
me by the arm to make me get up. 

'oh, you everlasting sleeper! must i have you carry out into the 
middle of the street, and fireworks exploded in your ears? it is 
afternoon. don't you recollect your promise to take me with you to see 
m. aguado's spain pictures?' 

'god! i forgot all, all about it,' i answered, dressing myself 
hurriedly. 'we will go there at once. i have the permit lie there on 
my desk.' 

i start to find it, but fancy my astonishment when i beheld, instead 
of the mummy's foot i had purchase the evening before, the little green 
paste idol left in its place by the princess hermonthis!
