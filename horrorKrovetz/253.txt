preface 
it all start with a dutchman, a pennsylvania dutchman name peter 
scheinberger, who till a weather beaten farm back in the hills. 

a strong, wiry man he was--his arms were knot section of solid 
hickory form themselves into gnarled hand and twist stub of 
fingers. his furrow brow, dry by the sun and cracked in a million 
place by the wind was well irrigate by long rivulet of sweat. when he 
went forth in the field behind his horse and plow, it wasn't long 
before his hair was plastered down firm to his scalp. the salty water 
pour out of the deep ring in his ruddy neck and ran down his dark 
brown back. as he grew old the skin peel and grew loose. it hung on 
him in fold like the brittle hide of a rhino. 

it seem that the more years he spent in his field behind the plow 
horse, the more he slip back into the timeless tradition of his 
forefathers. he was a proud descendant of a long line of staunch germany 
settler commonly known as the pennsylvania dutch. he grew up in his 
fundamental, religious sect have never known any other environment. he 
was expose to the sun, soil, and wind from the early days of his 
childhood, and along with the elements he also was expose to the evil 
of the _hexerei_. the _hexerei_, or witchcraft, was something that was 
never doubt or scoff at by his people. then why should he, a good 
pennsylvania dutchman, doubt or scoff at such tradition? 

perhaps, had he move away from his ancestral lands and had been 
cultured in modern communities, been educated and raise in other 
schools, he might have matured. but have no time for any other 
diversion than might be found on his rustic homestead, he grew up 
behind the plow horse, tramp in the dark, stony pasture land, eking 
out his meager existence from the black field of pennsylvania. 

now, peter's life could have gone on unnoticed among these forgotten 
hills, except for the strange visit of martin g. mirestone, student of 
germany history. 

it was a cold night when peter met mirestone. peter had been sitting up 
rather late ponder over an old, yellow book by the light of a 
kerosene lamp. the pale flame flicker about the wall send shadow 
scurry back and forth create all type of weird shape and designs. 
peter huddle over the wither pages, every now and then glancing up at 
the wall to watch the fantastic games that light and dark were playing. 
then putt his book aside for the night he prepared to go to bed. 

he went over to the window to draw the shutters, stopping for an instant 
to peer out into the gloom along the stony path that ran from his house 
to an old foot-bridge about fifty feet away. curling up from the gorge, 
mist seem to play among the rot planks; it rose and fell in great 
billow blankets, sometimes conceal the structure from view. 

* * * * * 

peter was about to latch the shutter and leave when his attention was 
focus upon a figure that seem to emerge from the fog--sort of fade 
in from nowhere. it made its way across the narrow span like some 
ghostly apparition. the mist envelop his leg and cloud his 
features. peter drew back in terror, for the mere appearance of the man 
coming out of the dark was enough to fill his infant brain with 
vision of death and _hexerei_. 

as the figure drew close peter saw that it was wearing a cloak. all the 
more ghostly it appear with the cloak sailing behind him in the wind 
like some devil's banner. peter just stood transfix as he watch the 
stranger come up the winding road to his house. 

slam the shutter he hurried fasten it and then turn to the 
door to bolt that also. too late. the door was thrown open revealing a 
tall man clothe in black. his face was wreathe in a wide grin--a grin 
that seem to make fun of the grayish pallor of his face and the 
ominous appearance of his wild garb. before the man step inside, 
peter made a mental image of the scene, for it was to be firm imbed 
in his mind so that he would never forget the slightest detail for the 
rest of his life--the wind blow about the fierce visage, toss up 
the long strand of hair; the massive, veined hand that clutch the 
wrought iron thumb-latch, and the way that the lamp struck his face, 
highlight the thin, ridge nose and high cheekbones. 

"peter scheinberger, heh?" the man spoke in perfect german. "peter 
scheinberger, the last of your clan here in america." 

it was several seconds before peter could muster up enough courage to 
answer him. drawing back slow he brace himself against the table, and 
in a thick, guttural germany asked, "who are you?" 

the stranger shut the door and drew the bolt. he cross the room and, 
with an air of one who was accustomed to have his own way wherever he 
went, scan the shelves of peter's larder with a practiced eye. 

peter watch him close as he drew down a bottle of wine, broke the 
neck against a beam above him, and settled down in peter's easy chair. 
he pour a glass full and shove it across the table towards the 
anxious peter, and then pour another glass for himself. 

"mirestone," the stranger finally answered, "martin g. mirestone." then, 
drain his glass, he added, "student of germany history." 

all this was beyond peter's comprehension. no one ever had the audacity 
to walk into his house and help himself to whatever he wanted--he was 
indeed unheard of in his tiny social world. 

"well, what are you staring at?" mirestone boom out. "take my cloak, 
please, then be seated. we'll talk." 

taking the cloak and drape it over a wooden peg in the wall, peter 
move cautious around the foreboding character that monopolize his 
small house. careful seating himself opposite the man, he move the 
table so that it set between them as a protective barrier. 

"i'll make myself clear to you," mirestone explained, "for i want my 
stay to be as brief as possible." 

he pour himself another glass of wine, then settled back in the chair, 
half close his eyes. "you see, i am a student, you might say, of 
germany history or folklore. i am in the process of writing a collective 
history of the pennsylvania dutch folk, their habits, beliefs, and--" he 
broke off for an instant as he lean forward across the table, staring 
into the frightened eyes of peter "--and their superstitions." 

shift his chair around in order to get benefit from the heat of the 
fireplace, mirestone went on. "now i want facts, scheinberger, authentic 
facts. i am prepared to pay you well for your trouble, but i insist on 
information that is back up with sound, accurate truth." 

peter became more relax but still slightly uneasy. he didn't like the 
attitude of this man, mirestone. he was too sure of himself--altogether 
too cocky. but then on the other hand he had said there would be a 
financial gain from any business that he could transact with him. money 
was something that peter knew he need in order to keep his farm going, 
and any income, however small it may be, would be welcome gratefully. 
yes, he decided that he had better endure the rude of this man. 

for a few seconds, however, the tall stranger seem to lose all of his 
cockiness, and a somber look crept over his jovial features. "have you 
ever heard of the hex of the white feather?" 

peter thought a moment before he replied. "yes. i have heard of it." 
then nervous he finger his glass of wine that he had not as yet 
touched. raise it up to his lip he sip it slow as he stare at 
mirestone over the rim of the glass. "yes. i have heard of it," he 
repeated. 

"good, good. you have heard of it. now, you will tell me about it, of 
course. i want to know all about it--how it is practiced, the results, 
and so forth." 

"is that why you came here? only to learn of the white feather hex?" 

* * * * * 

mirestone climb to his feet and pace the room. "yes," he said. peter 
noted a sad tone in his voice, and he wait for him to say more. 

"yes," mirestone continued. "i have, like you, heard of the hex of the 
white feather. i have trace it down to several families, but none could 
tell me anything about it that was factual. half of the stupid fool 
made up story as they went along--some concoct the biggest bunch of 
asinine tale that i've ever heard. but you, peter, are a descendant of 
the scheinbergers. i know for a fact that otto scheinberger practiced 
the white feather hex and pass the power on down to your father. from 
there it stopped. however, there must be some record of it in your 
family. you are in possession of the books of your grandfather, aren't 
you?" 

"i have several of his books. some of them i have read." 

"well," mirestone waited. "did you come across anything about the hex?" 

"yes," answer peter. "i read about that which you mention." 

"splendid, now we are get somewhere. can you find me the book that 
tell of it?" 

peter finished drink his wine and setting the glass upon the table, 
he slow rose and face mirestone with a look of superior play 
about his rustic features. "no, i am afraid not. you see, i have burn 
the book." 

mirestone's face went white. "you burn it?" 

"yes," said peter. "i don't wish to have anything to do with such black 
magic. it is better burned." 

"but you must remember the hex. although the book is destroy you still 
have the information in your head, _nein_?" 

"i could never forget it if i want to," reply peter reluctantly. "if 
i could burn my memory also it would be better." 

mirestone went back to the fireplace and placed several chunk of wood 
on the blaze. a bright orange glow leap out from the hearth and dance 
mocking over his pallid brow, hiding his lank jowl in the shadow 
cast by the cheekbones. like some grim spectre he rose up, towering 
above the little dutchman. peter had only to look into his eyes to see 
the imperative request that linger behind the hollow sockets. 

* * * * * 

throughout the remainder of the night peter, almost in spite of himself, 
wrack his brain to bring back to mind everything that was mention in 
the book about the hex of the white feather. the idea was clear enough, 
but the minute details, the infinite possibility for mistake, and the 
exacting specification concerning the experiment were blur in his 
memory. he knew that with time he could bring back everything that he 
had read, but it would take deep concentration and, perhaps, many days 
of trial and error to determine the right path that they must follow in 
order to have success. 

mirestone, realize that any distraction would break peter's train of 
thought, sat quiet in the corner finish off the dutchman's supply 
of wine. he watch peter close through his slit eyes, and it 
seem that his compel stare was the only force that could drive the 
frightened peter on. every so often peter would glance up and see 
mirestone leaning back in the corner half conceal by the deep 
shadows--only his partially open eyes could be seen flicker in the 
fiery glow of the hearth. then he would cover his face with his large, 
knot hands, work the twist finger through his hair, and try to 
bring back to mind the evil recipe. 

the glow from the fireplace gradual die down to make room for the 
stream of morning dawn. peter blink sleepy and got up to stretch a 
bit. outside the dull morning light work its way over peter's 
farm--clouds of mist still pour up from the gorge, circle the bridge 
and creep up the bank across the fields. peter unlatched the heavy 
oaken door and went outside to the outbuildings. 

meanwhile, mirestone had start a fire in the stove and was place 
slab of bacon in the pan. "nothing like a good old-fashioned peasant's 
breakfast," he laugh as peter came in the door several minutes later. 
"so, you brought a goat, heh?" he noticed. "are you figure on start 
in soon?" 

peter set a small kid on the floor and watch it scamper about the 
room, look for an exit. "yes, we might as well. i don't like this 
business at all. i wish to get it over with as soon as possible, 
and----" peter eye mirestone squarely. "i expect to be paid well for my 
trouble." he was try to make himself believe that that was his only 
reason for comply with mirestone's demands. actually he was not so 
sure.... 

* * * * * 

as the heat of the noon day sun blasted down on their backs, mirestone 
watch peter pass a feather, freshly pluck from a white leghorn, 
under the nose of the bleat kid. mirestone listen careful to what 
peter was telling him. the breath of the victim had to be spread over 
the feather before anything further could be done. 

"tie him," command peter. mirestone held the goat by the scruff of his 
neck and fasten a halter about him. the other end was secure to a 
stake allow the kid to run about in a circle of ten feet or so in 
diameter. 

"we will leave him for awhile," said peter as he walk back to the 
kitchen. 

mirestone follow in the dutchman's footsteps, and when they were 
inside, he listen intent as peter recite a monosyllabic chant over 
the feather. "the chant is easy enough to learn," peter assured him. 
"you will master it quickly." 

"i understand so far," mirestone said. 

"then that is all," peter finished, "except that you can hang the 
feather up and watch it grow red." 

"red?" 

"yes," peter explained, "that is the only way you can tell if the hex 
has worked." 

peter went to a chest at the foot of his bed and drew out a small box of 
sewing utensils. he broke off a piece of black thread and replace the 
box in the chest. "now i'll show you what i mean," peter spoke weary 
as he tie the feather with the thread and suspend it from one of the 
rafter in the room. "just sit and watch." 

it was not many minutes before a light red tint crept up the feather's 
quill, spread slow outwards towards the fringe edges. deep and 
deep grew the intensity of the color until it reach a pure blood 
red. 

"hurry outside," cry peter. "you can see the goat in its last seconds 
of life." 

mirestone hurried after the dutchman. jerk at the halter the goat 
bleat in agony, prance up and down frantically. its eyes grew 
horrible bloodshot and finally closed. with a feeble, choke sigh, the 
animal drop over on its side, its leg still twitch spasmodically. 
mirestone bent over the hairy form and examine the head, now wet with 
perspiration. 

"nothing can be done for the beast?" 

"no." peter look on with a touch of pity in his eyes, "nothing can be 
done once the feather has turn red." 

as if the death of the kid was their cue, masses of thick thunderhead 
turn over with a deep rumbling thunder. the sky became crystal clear, 
and a greenish glow could be seen working its way across the horizon. 
the sky darken as the glisten thunderhead now taking on an ominous 
coloring warn the farmer of the impending storm. 

it was later that evening. rain drum against the slate roof of 
peter's house and reverberate through the rooms to where mirestone and 
the dutchman sat by the fire in silence. mirestone broke the still 
atmosphere by putt forth a question that peter somehow knew would be 
coming soon or later. 

"i wonder how the hex would react on a human being?" 

peter hope to end the topic by answer him quick and not beating 
around the bush try to evade the question. "it would kill him 
eventually. maybe not so quick as the goat, but it would kill him." 

"what do you mean not as quick as the goat--do you think it would take 
more time on a human?" 

"perhaps. i have heard of case in which the hex, once it was started, 
drag on for many days." 

"i see." mirestone sat back again thinking to himself. 

peter didn't like this. he want to get rid of mirestone. "well, you 
have your information. i show you how the hex works. so, why not pay 
me and leave?" 

mirestone got up and laugh in the dutchman's face. crossing to the 
larder, he brought down a bottle, crack the neck on the beam above, 
just as he had done the night before. a wave of apprehension overcame 
peter as he realize the old flip attitude of mirestone's was coming 
back. that meant definite trouble, and peter began to fear the 
consequences. 

"so, why not pay me and leave?" he again ventured. "or do you want 
something else?" peter knew that he didn't need to ask that last 
question, for already he realize the grim experiment that was play 
about in mirestone's head. 

"yes. i just told you what i wanted. i want to see the hex on a human 
before i go." 

"why? you have your information. why do you want to see it work on a 
man?" 

"my stupid, little peasant friend, do i look like a student of history?" 

for the first time peter actually look at mirestone and saw him for 
what he was. of course, he couldn't be a student. no student would act 
as he did, or even look as he did. the words jam in his throat as he 
was about to voice a reply. 

"ha--martin g. mirestone, student of history, student of germany history. 
no my little oxen friend. i am no more a student of history than you 
are, but i need the hex for other reason which do not concern you." 
then as if he were contemplate a great new joke he continued. "but on 
the other hand, maybe the future of the white feather hex do concern 
you." 

mirestone's voice was drown out by a heavy rumbling of thunder and the 
increase splash of rain on the windows. but somehow peter seem not 
to notice. 

* * * * * 

somewhat later mirestone step quiet over to the sleep form of 
his host. peter had been over twenty-four hour now without sleep, and 
although the old dutchman had try desperate to fight off the 
drowsy that overcame him, the recent excitement of the day had 
finally taken its toll. lightning struck near by follow with an ear 
splitting blast that shook the house to its rocky foundations. pieces of 
slate flew off the roof and were carry away into the night. the rain 
pour down in a great deluge, blur the window, making it impossible 
to see in or out. 

mirestone held out a glisten white feather in his long spidery 
fingers. he placed it within a few inch of peter's nose and watch 
the delicate edge riffle in the dutchman's breath. crossing to the 
table, he lean over the white fluff and breathe the short germany 
incantation over it. how it glisten in the firelight! he bent close 
and close as he whisper the magic words that peter had taught him, 
his breath ruffle the feather, play about in the fringe softness. 
he hung up the feather by a thread and watch it hop back and forth in 
the center of the room. 

* * * * * 

peter awaken and saw mirestone sitting by the fire note every 
movement of the feather. "what are you doing, heh?" 

mirestone swung around and glare at the bleary eye dutchman. "sit 
down," he commanded. "sit down and watch the feather turn red." 

peter didn't need to be told that it was his feather. he knew by the 
merciless eyes of mirestone that everything was over. "so, you were 
determined to find out what would happen if the hex were try on a 
man?" 

peter was surprise at how easily he took his fate. there was no need of 
excitement--this was his end and there was no change it. 

"yes, i had to know, for i can't leave until i have a complete record of 
all the results." mirestone certainly was not cocky now. he look 
almost ashamed of himself as he sat there nervous watch a man's 
fate swing by a silken thread. "i'm sorry, peter, my friend, but that is 
how it must be. you are a step stone to a glorious reckoning that 
will soon take place. the hex of the white feather--i can hardly believe 
that i have at last track it down. and you, peter, are the last 
witness, the last link in the chain of those who know the secret, and 
how can it better end than by your becoming a part of the secret?" 

peter realize that he had not much long to live and nothing he could 
do to mirestone would change his fate. perhaps he could save others, 
though. 

"what is this glorious reckoning you were speak about?" 

"as soon as i see how your case ends, i'll be able to go ahead and 
release my vengeance on those stupid, bungle fool who have thwart 
my progress in the black arts. they claim to speak in the name of 
humanity, no less!" 

"in that case," exclaim peter, "i won't let myself be a foothold for 
your damn work--it is of the devil and i'll have no part of it." 

"shut up, fool. you are a part of it already." 

"not if my body is destroy before you can get hold of it." 

peter play his trump card. he quick sprang back and slip out the 
door into the storm. mirestone jump up after him, but it was too late. 
he peer out into the rage tempest making out the figure of peter 
struggle with the hatch on the horse barn. he pull his cloak about 
him and start towards peter to stop him. the rain beat his face, 
blind him momentarily, and before he could see clearly a dark mass 
pound by, swift hoof spatter mud all over him. 

down the road sped peter on the horse--down the road and towards the 
foot-bridge. mirestone ran a few steps and halted. he heard the hollow 
staccato of horse's hoof on the plank for an instant, follow by a 
splinter crash that rumble up from the gorge. a long, guttural cry 
pierce the black gloom as man and horse plunge down to the seethe 
death await them. 

curse savagely, milestone trudge back through the rain to the house. 
he slam the door shut and threw his cloak on peter's bed. there was 
one more bottle on the shelf; he smashed the neck and pour a glass. if 
one could see him bent over the table send silent curse into his 
wine, he could readily imagine the feeling of defeat that had spread 
over mirestone's countenance. the idiot of a dutchman who had to play 
the hero's part and save other lives by ending his own made mirestone 
fairly sick. however, all was not over. so the dutchman had died; the 
hex had worked--a lot soon than he had expect though. now he 
certainly would be delay in his progress, for he had count on 
examine the body for any trace left that would suggest something out 
of the ordinary. one thing, however, he had learned was that the hex at 
least work on humans. the mangle body that was being wash over the 
rocks would be enough proof on that score. 

mirestone pour another drink. he lean back in the chair and placed 
the glass to his lips. he was tilt so far back that as he raise the 
wine to a drink position, it block his view of the room. as he 
slow sip it, however, the room began to come into view--the ceiling 
first and slow the wall. his eyes focus on a piece of thread hanging 
from the ceiling, and as the wine sank lower and lower in the glass, the 
thread grew long and long until in one last swallow he was able to 
see the end of the line. 

mirestone's hand went stiff as he look at the thread, for on the end 
of it was a pure white feather. 

* * * * * 

in an instant mirestone realize that the hex had not worked. peter's 
death at the bridge had been a grotesque coincidence. had the untimely 
plunge in the rapids been the result of the hex the feather would have 
long since been red, therefore, the tragedy was no more than an accident 
and mirestone's hand were innocent of the dutchman's blood. that 
realization, of course, didn't bother him, for he was not concerned 
whether or not he was responsible for peter's death, but he was 
genuine worried in the failure of the hex. he wonder if he had done 
something wrong. if he had, the last link, that could have correct him 
was broken. from here on in he was on his own. 

he calm himself and began to think. he retrace everything that he had 
done to see if he couldn't have found some margin in which error could 
have crept in. he remember how careful he had bent over the feather 
recite the exact words taught him by peter. he especially remember 
that part of the hex, for hadn't the feather been ruffle by his breath 
when he spoke.... 

gradual the truth began to dawn on mirestone. his own breath must have 
release peter from the hex. the last person's breath that touched the 
feather would feel the sting of the power. mirestone sat back 
dumbfounded. he was to be his own guinea pig. what ghastly horror was he 
in for? would he die quick like the goat or would his death be 
prolonged over a period of days like peter had suggested. he grip 
himself. it wouldn't do to lose control of his senses. there must be a 
way out of the predicament. but peter said that as soon as the feather 
turn red there was no turning back. ah--there's the answer. the 
feather is still white ... there's still a chance. 

mirestone grab his cloak and race for the door. he must get an 
animal--another goat, perhaps, and expose the feather to its breath. he 
must hurry lest the spell will start working. 

the slippery mud drag him back and impede his progress, but he 
struggle on through the blind storm towards the barn. it was so 
black outside that he could hardly make out the buildings. all at once 
he saw the barn loom ahead of him. which door? every second counted; 
he would try the first one he came to. wait--what's this holding his 
cloak? mirestone turn and fumble with some barbed wire fencing. it 
had snag him in the dark, and he soon became hopeless entangle in 
it. crying and shrieking, he tore the cloak from his shoulder and ran 
on in his shirt sleeves. he wrench open a door and sprawl in the 
barn head first. on his hand and knee he scurry across the mealy 
floor to the goat stall. the kid sprang in terror as he lurch in 
drunkenly, grab about in the dark for one of them. catching one by 
the hind leg, he grope his way out again. 

thrust his shoulder forward he slid through the gripping mud, 
tear his way through the engulf rain with his free hand. his leg 
left numb from the wound inflict by the barbed wire, and a trickle of 
blood was running down his shins. without thinking he reach down to 
rub the wound, but quick yank his hand up again. what was that 
horrible sensation he felt as he pass his hand over the fleshy sore? 
he couldn't see in the rain, but his leg told him that it was something 
hairy, almost bristly. 

he ran on towards the house, stumble in the treacherous mud. once he 
fell completely down in the slime. wipe the dripping earth from his 
face, he was told again that something was wrong. his cheek verify 
his shin's story of a rough, jagged caress. 

holding his hand in front of his face he saw, amidst a flash of 
lightning, a curling, black claw, bristle with long, ragged hairs. 
scream hysterical he drop the kid and fell forward into the door 
of the house. the latch gave way with his weight and he tumble into the 
cottage. 

dance madly on the end of a thread was a blood red feather.
