_it isn't much of a secret, but 
it's the only one. the trick is ..._ 

don't think about it 

by william w. stuart 

[transcriber's note: this etext was produce from 
world of if science fiction, november 1960. 
extensive research did not uncover any evidence that 
the u.s. copyright on this publication was renewed.] 


tommy wasn't really a timid child. sometimes he didn't understand 
things and was puzzled. more often, grown-ups couldn't or wouldn't 
understand things that were perfectly clear to him and he was more 
puzzled. occasional such things worried and even upset him a little. 
then momma and sometimes daddy would translate baffle into silly 
adult terms and think that he was afraid. 

it was that way about the hole in the closet when tommy was just a bit 
over three. tommy wasn't really afraid. mr. bear was afraid and the 
thing did puzzle tommy. so he ask about it, but he never did get any 
sensible or satisfactory answers, and that did worry and perhaps even 
upset him a little. 

but he wasn't afraid, even before daddy finally told him, "now, tommy, 
boy. don't think about it and it won't scare you. really, there is 
nothing there to hurt you, if you just don't think about it. so don't 
you think about it any more--there's daddy's big boy." 

this certainly was not any sort of explanation. but still tommy did try 
hard not to think about it, as daddy said. and now he really doesn't 
think about it at all any more. or about aunt martha, either. 

the hole was in the closet in tommy's room. tommy and momma and daddy 
live in a not very big, not very new frame house on the edge of the 
city and aunt martha live with them. tommy didn't--at least not yet, 
although there were promises--have any brother or sisters. but he 
did have his own room and a family of his own, too. it was the extra 
bedroom and it had a closet that was cramped and with no light. tommy 
like his room. it was small, with a small bed, and it belong to 
him, along with his family of mr. bear and old rabbit and kokey koala. 
it was also in easy crying range of momma and daddy's room and aunt 
martha's room, so if mr. bear, who was the timid one, got frightened in 
the night, tommy could cry--purely in mr. bear's behalf--to bring help. 
or at least company. 

tommy and his family all like the closet well enough too, except for 
the shelf that was out of reach even from the "don't climb" stool. the 
closet was good to hide in or play bear cave or rabbit hole and fine 
for finding missing toy after momma had a spell of play clean 
house. 

the day tommy found the hole in the closet was the week after his 
third birthday. daddy was at work. momma was out shopping. it was a 
rainy afternoon. aunt martha was sitting with tommy and the afternoon 
television. 

* * * * * 

he was in his room with his family and they all agree as soon as they 
heard the television coming on strong that it would be a very poor 
afternoon to waste on a nap. besides, mr. bear's feelings had been 
hurt by have been somewhat left out of things recently in favor of 
new birthday presents, now largely broken or tiresome. to make it up 
to him, tommy and old rabbit and kokey all agree to play bear cave in 
the closet. it was a nice game and go well enough, except for some 
grumbling from kokey koala, who always want to argue and claim that 
bear live in trees, not caves. 

but then--and it was mr. bear's fault for wanting it darker, so he 
could hibernate--the closet door shut tight. that didn't seem so 
serious at first. it would only mean a scold for being out of bed 
when aunt martha would come to open it after tommy holler loud 
enough. and then there was the hole in the closet, back in the corner 
next to the broken drum. they all saw it and they heard the ugly thing 
talk or thinking at them. it stretch out a part of itself at mr. 
bear, who was the closest. 

it didn't grab mr. bear, but he was terrify just the same. and none 
of them like it. they didn't like it at all. the ugly thing couldn't 
come out of the hole because the hole wasn't big enough yet, but it 
try and it was making the hole bigger. and it kept thinking at them, 
red thoughts, and hungry, as it tore at the edge of the hole. the 
family all look to tommy, so tommy cry and yelled. 

finally aunt martha heard him and came to open the door. then the 
afternoon sunlight stream across the floor into the closet and the 
ugly red thought from the thing pull back, far back, so you could 
barely notice them, and you couldn't see the hole any more, even though 
you knew it was still there. at least tommy and mr. bear and old rabbit 
and kokey koala knew. 

after she open the closet door and carry tommy from the closet to 
the living room, aunt martha scolded. she wasn't really mad because 
she had wait until a commercial interrupt her television program 
before answer the cries from the closet. but she scold because she 
was aunt martha and scold was what aunt martha did. a really good 
cry, even one work up strict as a service for a companion, take a 
little time to turn off. then, after a few settle gulps, tommy try 
to explain. 

"auntie. aunt martha, there's a hole in the cave--in the closet--and 
there's a thing inside of it." 

he look at mr. bear whom he was holding by one foot and at kokey, 
drop by aunt martha on the sofa, for confirmation. then, quickly, he 
wriggle down from auntie's lap. old rabbit! 

* * * * * 

bravely, tommy ran to the closet and was relieved. the door was open 
and, in the gray afternoon light, the hole was still not to be seen. 
old rabbit, who always had a bad temper, was annoy and snappish at 
have been left behind. but he was there and all right. tommy rescue 
him and ran back to aunt martha. 

"it was hungry," he continue his explanation. 

aunt martha, as always, was difficult. "who is hungry? you shouldn't be 
hungry, tommy. you just had your lunch an hour ago. do you want a glass 
of milk?" 

"not me hungry." tommy was impatient. aunt martha never seem able to 
grasp any idea more complex than a glass of milk or wet pants. little 
boys, in her mind, nearly always either want the one or had the 
other. such things she could and did attend to with a virtuous sense of 
duty done. but anything else was beyond her. 

"tommy! are your pants wet?" 

tommy sigh in resignation and wet his pants. it was the only thing 
to do. otherwise auntie would fuss and fume, accomplish nothing, 
understanding nothing, for the rest of the afternoon. 

ten minutes later, in dry pants, he finished an unwanted glass of milk. 
aunt martha, conscience appeased, return to soap opera. tommy and his 
family, nap safe forgotten, play away the afternoon--but not in the 
closet or even, as was usual on rainy days, in tommy's room. instead, 
finding daddy's old briefcase full of papers, they play office in the 
family room, with old rabbit grumbling about have to be miss wicksey, 
who drove the electric typewriter in daddy's office. 

momma and daddy came home together at a bit after five. tommy took his 
scold about mess up daddy's papers in good part. he had expect 
it. but aunt martha was angry about the scold she got for letting 
him, mild though it was. 

in retaliation, she said, "tommy, you were a naughty, naughty boy. 
and for being so naughty you must take your big bear and your rabbit 
and the little bear or whatever the thing is and put them away in the 
closet. and leave them there till tomorrow." 

"no! no, no, no, i won't! it isn't fair. they weren't bad. and the ugly 
thing is in the hole and it might come out and it's hungry and--and my 
family is all afraid." 

"tommy!" aunt martha's voice was sharp. "you stop that nonsense and put 
your toys--" 

"wait. wait up now," said daddy, who also live in the grown-up world, 
but who sometimes try to understand things. "what is this about a 
hole in the closet? what about something being hungry?" 

"that's all," said tommy. "the ugly thing in the hole in the closet. it 
_is_ hungry." 

there was more to it than that, of course, but how could a thing like 
that be explain through a wall of grown, closed minds? there was 
the hole in the closet. you couldn't exactly see it. you could only 
sort of feel seeing it and the hairy thing--at least it seem hairy 
and shapeless, or have many different shape and a mouth and sharp 
teeth--and it had reach out with something and touched mr. bear and 
would have eaten him too, if he had blood. but then it had pull back 
from mr. bear and red hunger thought came strong and stronger. even 
now, stretch out from the hole where it was hidden there in the 
closet, tommy could feel the reaching, greedy thoughts. but he couldn't 
explain all that. 

"there is a hole in the closet," tommy said again. 

* * * * * 

but he knew that not even daddy would understand. of course momma 
wouldn't. not momma, who was loving but very busy and just sat so 
often, dream or listen to baby sister that they said was in her 
stomach, so big and fat now as to leave little lap room. momma was 
too occupy look inward to look out much at tommy. daddy, to give 
him credit, was nearly always willing to look, but there were so many 
things he couldn't see. still tommy had to try. 

"the ugly thing in the hole. it wants something to eat." 

"oh, tommy! such horrible nonsense!" that was momma. she wasn't even 
go to think about it. it is a question sometimes whether baby 
sister are worth all the bother and trouble. 

"now, tommy." daddy was being helpful. "you say there is a hole in your 
closet? and that there is something in the hole?" 

"well-ll. sort of." really, the ugly thing wasn't so much in the hole 
as on the other side of it. but that was close enough. 

"all right then, tommy. suppose you show it to me." 

"what?" 

"show me the hole, tommy." 

"now?" 

"yes." 

"the hole in the closet?" 

"tommy!" 

"yes, daddy." this wasn't go to work out to anything good and tommy 
didn't want to go back to the closet and close the closet door anyway. 
the thing didn't eat mr. bear because mr. bear didn't have blood. but 
daddy had and ... "tommy!" 

they went to the closet. at least, if he was risk a daddy, tommy 
thought, he was protect mr. bear and the others. 

"now where is this hole, tommy?" 

"over there by the corner." tommy pointed. 

daddy went into the closet to look. tommy start to close the door. in 
the black dark, daddy would see what tommy meant about the thing in the 
hole. from the outside, tommy start to close the door. it was a small 
closet and hardly big enough for both of them. 

"tommy! what are you try to do? open that door." 

"but--" after all, the hole wasn't there, or scarcely seem to be 
there, except in the dark. 

"open it up wider. hm-m. i believe i do see. wait till i get my 
lighter.... say, by george, i believe you're right. there _is_ a little 
hole there. looks like a mouse hole." 

there it was, as tommy might have known. grown-ups will always avoid 
seeing the important things. of course there was a mouse hole there, 
the home of the little old mr. mouse with the wiggle nose and the gray 
whiskers. he had been nice. but he wasn't there any more and tommy had 
a pretty clear idea of what had happen to him. that poor little old 
mr. mouse had had blood. 

"but, daddy--" 

it was hopeless. "dorrie! martha!" daddy's hunting instinct was 
aroused. "have we got a mouse trap? any cheese? there is a hole in that 
closet, a little old mouse hole and i'm go to--" 

well, perhaps this would be better than if he hadn't found anything. 

tommy follow daddy about as he finally located a mouse trap. no 
cheese? he cut a little piece of meat for bait. of course tommy knew no 
trap would catch the ugly thing. 

"what in the world happen to my lighter?" daddy want to know. tommy 
didn't answer that. but at least everybody, even aunt martha, had 
forgotten about shut tommy's family up in the closet. for now that 
was enough. 

but later, after supper, after bath, after the shoot picture on the 
tv, it was time for bed. 

"daddy?" 

"get on to bed now, son. past bedtime. hop to it." 

"daddy, i want to sleep with you and momma tonight." 

* * * * * 

well, it was a mighty dark night. the afternoon rain had built up into 
a real storm. mr. bear was terrified. kokey was scared and even tough 
old rabbit didn't want to sleep in tommy's room with the ugly thing in 
the hole so hungry and wait to rip its way out of the hole when it 
got dark enough--and only the street light outside the room to keep 
away the dark because they would never let tommy keep his light on at 
night. 

"my family and me don't want to sleep in my room tonight." 

"now, tommy, just because it's a little stormy--daddy's big boy isn't 
afraid of a little wind and rain?" 

"i'm not afraid, daddy. it's my family. you know how family are. you 
always say about momma--" 

"never mind that now. to bed. your own bed." 

"but daddy, there's the ugly thing in the hole! and it's hungry!" 

"the mouse?" 

daddy went to look at his trap, switch on the light in tommy's room. 
he came back in a minute. 

"the little devil!" 

did daddy know? no. 

"the little devil got away with the bait, clean as a whistle. only a 
little plaster dust or something left in the trap where i put the meat." 

mr. bear shivered. "now don't be foolish, bear. you don't _have_ blood. 
the ugly thing won't get you," tommy told him softly. but mr. bear 
wouldn't listen. he was a cry-baby, a scaredy-cat. but to tell the 
truth--the real, honest truth--the whole family and even tommy didn't 
feel too good about it. 

"tommy? what was that you were saying?" 

"daddy! i wanna sleep with you and momma. me and my family. we're 
scared of that thing." tommy knew it was no less than his duty to 
protect them all. 

"oh, now, tommy! you don't mean to say you're afraid of a little old 
mouse? a big boy like you?" 

"well, mr. bear is--i don't--daddy! it is there, honest it is, in that 
hole and it's hungry and it'll come out in the dark and--" 

"tommy! a little mouse! get on into your room now and no more argument." 

tommy's face began to crumple. if he had to, he would fight this one 
out all the way--tears, tantrum, kick, scream, gasp, hold his breath 
and turn blue-- 

"now, now, tommy-boy." daddy did mean well and sometimes he was even 
right and so tommy always did try to do what daddy said. "tommy, you 
mustn't let things like that bother you. if we can't catch the little 
mouse, forget it. there's nothing more we can do, so just don't think 
about it. you see?" 

sniff. "no." 

"don't think about it, that's all. there is nothing there that can hurt 
you, if you just don't think about it. so don't think about it--that's 
daddy's big boy." 

"well-ll.... and then can we sleep with you and momma?" 

aunt martha rang in her nickel's worth. "a boy ought to be ashamed to 
be afraid of a little mouse." 

"it's not--" 

"not what?" 

"uh--it's mr. bear that's afraid. of the--" 

"and you just stop that nonsense about those ridiculous stuff 
animals, you hear me? nobody should make such a fuss about a little 
mouse." 

"momma does. momma!" tommy let two fat tear trickle down his cheeks, a 
warning, but he meant them too. "momma-a-a, can't we--" 

"all right, all right! stop this stupid wrangling! you know how it 
get on my nerves. for goodness' sake, let him sleep with us tonight. 
anyway, _i_ don't blame him. i wouldn't sleep a wink in the same room 
with a mouse. be sure you shut our door tonight. tight." 

"you're spoil the child," said aunt martha sourly. 

"auntie," said tommy, "i bet you're chicken to let your door stay open." 

"well!" huff aunt martha. "the impertinence! i certainly _shall_ keep 
my door open. no mouse is go to keep me from get good, fresh 
air." 

* * * * * 

tommy was a very bright little boy. now, with the door shut in momma 
and daddy's room, and aunt martha's door open, he wouldn't think about 
the ugly thing in the hole--waiting for dark, real dark--to come 
out--and eat. 

"all right, tommy. this once you can sleep with your mother and me. get 
on to bed and mind you sleep quiet. and don't spread those stuff--your 
family all over the bed either." 

"yes, daddy. and, daddy--" 

"what?" 

"i won't think about it now, the thing in the hole." 

tommy said his good nights. tonight he even kiss aunt martha as if 
he meant it. and he took his family and he went to bed in momma and 
daddy's room. 

he did not think about the ugly thing. he went right to sleep, lie at 
the edge of the big, big bed. tommy, and old rabbit, and kokey koala, 
and even mr. bear went right to sleep. 

outside the wind blew hard and hard and the rain drove down and it 
was dark. the television reception was bad. everyone went to bed early. 
good night. lights out. 

in tommy's room it was quite dark with only the faint, watery ray of 
the street light on the corner swimming in through the rain. in the 
closet there was a stirring, a fumbling, a tear and the hole in the 
black grew, was forced, bigger, wider, as the thing pushed and 
rip at whatever was barring it from the warm, red, ooze food it 
craved; it must have; it would have. 

and, in a sudden gust, the wind blew hard still. somewhere in town, 
block away, a wire fell and blue sparks flash and crackle in 
the dripping night. in tommy's house the refrigerator went off, the 
electric clock stopped. the street light blink once and was gone and 
in tommy's closet there was a sudden, mighty surge of effort, a break, 
and something, not a sound, but something, a harsh and bloody sense or 
feel of rend greed flowing outward from the closet in a wave. 

aunt martha, in her sleep, said, "no. oh, no!" 

daddy interrupt a snore with a strained grunt. momma whimper soft 
and hug to herself her swollen stomach. 

tommy blink and was awake. soothingly, he pat kokey and old 
rabbit. he squeeze mr. bear's paw. then he slip his hand into the 
opening in mr. bear's overalls and took out daddy's cigarette lighter. 
he knew how to work it. but first he waited. 

"don't think about it," daddy had told him and he didn't think about 
it, really. but he couldn't help feeling it. the ugly thing was out, 
clear out of the hole now, and moving. he could feel that and the awful 
hunger moving with it. aunt martha's room was closest and her door was 
open. momma and daddy's room was closed. the ugly thing move fast, 
faster, and reach out, thirsting, hungering.... 

from aunt martha's room came the quaver wail and from the thing 
there flow a sense of vicious, evil joy. 

there it was, but was it enough? 

tommy hug mr. bear once, tightly, and slip noiseless from the 
bed. he wasn't thinking about it, he couldn't, he wouldn't think about 
it. but he knew what he had to do. he had the lighter. at the bedroom 
door he work it. open the door a crack; thrust it out. and then, in 
a little rush, back to bed where he lay quietly, and he didn't think 
about it, he and mr. bear and old rabbit and kokey koala. 

* * * * * 

after a little, the sense of feed hunger was gone and the feel of 
the ugly thing was gone, back into the hole in the closet, forced back 
by the flicker yellow light of the flame start by the cigarette 
lighter. then, when the smell of smoke grew thick in the room and he 
could hear the crackling of the fire burning the house, tommy shook 
daddy awake. 

it wasn't hard to get out through the bedroom window, except for momma. 
but she made it all right. and tommy had a little trouble holding 
tight to each member of his family as daddy lift him out of the 
window, but they made it all right too. of course aunt martha didn't 
make it--how could she? but it was fun watch the firemen in the rain 
from the krausmeyer's porch next door as the house and the closet with 
the hole in the closet all burn up together. 

aunt martha? 

"funny thing," tommy heard one fireman say to another the next day, in 
the sunshine, as they look over the smoulder ash, "the old bat 
must have been as dry as dust inside. twenty years in the department 
and i never did see a body so completely consumed--teeth, a little 
bone.... hey, get on away from here, son! get along on home with you!" 

daddy and momma said aunt martha had gone away on a trip. tommy might 
have known pretty well where she had gone, if he had thought about it, 
but he didn't think about it. none of his family did. what for? aunt 
martha had had to go away, sure. she went. all right, who miss aunt 
martha? 

anyway, there were lights in all of the closet in the new house they 
move to and lot of room for everyone, even baby sister. and there 
were no holes, not even mouse holes, in any of the closets.
