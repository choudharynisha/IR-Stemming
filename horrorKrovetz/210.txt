i 

by the light of a tallow candle, which had been placed on one end of a 
rough table, a man was reading something written in a book. it was an 
old account book, greatly worn; and the writing was not, apparently, 
very legible, for the man sometimes held the page close to the flame of 
the candle to get a strong light upon it. the shadow of the book would 
then throw into obscurity a half of the room, darken a number of 
face and figures; for besides the reader, eight other men were present. 
seven of them sat against the rough log walls, silent and motionless, 
and, the room being small, not very far from the table. by extend an 
arm any one of them could have touched the eighth man, who lay on the 
table, face upward, partly cover by a sheet, his arms at his sides. he 
was dead. 

the man with the book was not reading aloud, and no one spoke; all 
seem to be wait for something to occur; the dead man only was 
without expectation. from the blank dark outside came in, through 
the aperture that serve for a window, all the ever unfamiliar noise 
of night in the wilderness--the long, nameless note of a distant coyote; 
the stilly pulse thrill of tireless insect in trees; strange cries of 
night birds, so different from those of the bird of day; the drone of 
great blunder beetles, and all that mysterious chorus of small sound 
that seem always to have been but half heard when they have sudden 
ceased, as if conscious of an indiscretion. but nothing of all this was 
noted in that company; its member were not overmuch addict to idle 
interest in matter of no practical importance; that was obvious in 
every line of their rugged faces--obvious even in the dim light of the 
single candle. they were evidently men of the vicinity--farmers and 
woodmen. 

the person reading was a trifle different; one would have said of him 
that he was of the world, worldly, albeit there was that in his 
attire which attested a certain fellowship with the organism of his 
environment. his coat would hardly have pass muster in san francisco: 
his footgear was not of urban origin, and the hat that lay by him on 
the floor (he was the only one uncovered) was such that if one had 
considered it as an article of mere personal adornment he would have 
miss its meaning. in countenance the man was rather prepossessing, 
with just a hint of sternness; though that he may have assume or 
cultivated, as appropriate to one in authority. for he was a coroner. it 
was by virtue of his office that he had possession of the book in which 
he was reading; it had been found among the dead man's effects--in his 
cabin, where the inquest was now taking place. 

when the coroner had finished reading he put the book into his breast 
pocket. at that moment the door was pushed open and a young man entered. 
he, clearly, was not of mountain birth and breeding: he was clad as 
those who dwell in cities. his clothing was dusty, however, as from 
travel. he had, in fact, been riding hard to attend the inquest. 

the coroner nodded; no one else greet him. 

"we have wait for you," said the coroner. "it is necessary to have 
done with this business to-night." 

the young man smiled. "i am sorry to have kept you," he said. "i went 
away, not to evade your summons, but to post to my newspaper an account 
of what i suppose i am call back to relate." 

the coroner smiled. 

"the account that you post to your newspaper," he said, "differs 
probably from that which you will give here under oath." 

"that," reply the other, rather hotly and with a visible flush, "is as 
you choose. i use manifold paper and have a copy of what i sent. it was 
not written as news, for it is incredible, but as fiction. it may go as 
a part of my testimony under oath." 

"but you say it is incredible." 

"that is nothing to you, sir, if i also swear that it is true." 

the coroner was apparently not greatly affected by the young man's 
manifest resentment. he was silent for some moments, his eyes upon the 
floor. the men about the side of the cabin talk in whispers, but 
seldom withdrew their gaze from the face of the corpse. presently the 
coroner lift his eyes and said: "we will resume the inquest." 

the men remove their hats. the witness was sworn. 

"what is your name?" the coroner asked. 

"william harker." 

"age?" 

"twenty-seven." 

"you knew the deceased, hugh morgan?" 

"yes." 

"you were with him when he died?" 

"near him." 

"how did that happen--your presence, i mean?" 

"i was visiting him at this place to shoot and fish. a part of my 
purpose, however, was to study him, and his odd, solitary way of life. 
he seem a good model for a character in fiction. i sometimes write 
stories." 

"i sometimes read them." 

"thank you." 

"stories in general--not yours." 

some of the juror laughed. against a sombre background humor show high 
lights. soldier in the interval of battle laugh easily, and a jest in 
the death chamber conquer by surprise. 

"relate the circumstances of this man's death," said the coroner. "you 
may use any note or memoranda that you please." 

the witness understood. pull a manuscript from his breast pocket 
he held it near the candle, and turning the leaves until he found the 
passage that he wanted, began to read. 




ii 

"...the sun had hardly risen when we left the house. we were look for 
quail, each with a shotgun, but we had only one dog. morgan said that 
our best ground was beyond a certain ridge that he pointed out, and we 
cross it by a trail through the _chaparral_. on the other side was 
comparatively level ground, thick cover with wild oats. as we 
emerge from the _chaparral_, morgan was but a few yard in advance. 
suddenly, we heard, at a little distance to our right, and partly in 
front, a noise as of some animal thrashing about in the bushes, which we 
could see were violent agitated. 

"'we've start a deer,' said. 'i wish we had brought a rifle.' 

"morgan, who had stop and was intent watch the agitate 
chaparral, said nothing, but had cock both barrel of his gun, and was 
holding it in readiness to aim. i thought him a trifle excited, which 
surprise me, for he had a reputation for exceptional coolness, even in 
moments of sudden and imminent peril. 

"'o, come!' i said. 'you are not go to fill up a deer with 
quail-shot, are you?' 

"still he did not reply; but, catching a sight of his face as he 
turn it slightly toward me, i was struck by the pallor of it. then i 
understood that we had serious business on hand, and my first conjecture 
was that we had 'jumped' a grizzly. i advanced to morgan's side, cock 
my piece as i moved. 

"the bush were now quiet, and the sound had ceased, but morgan was as 
attentive to the place as before. 

"'what is it? what the devil is it?' i asked. 

"'that damn thing!' he replied, without turning his head. his voice 
was husky and unnatural. he tremble visibly. 

"i was about to speak further, when i observe the wild oats near the 
place of the disturbance moving in the most inexplicable way. i can 
hardly describe it. it seem as if stir by a streak of wind, which 
not only bent it, but pressed it down--crushed it so that it did not 
rise, and this movement was slow prolong itself directly toward us. 

"nothing that i had ever seen had affected me so strange as this 
unfamiliar and unaccountable phenomenon, yet i am unable to recall any 
sense of fear. i remember--and tell it here because, singularly enough, 
i recollect it then--that once, in look careless out of an open 
window, i momentarily mistook a small tree close at hand for one of a 
group of large tree at a little distance away. it look the same size 
as the others, but, being more distinct and sharp define in mass 
and detail, seem out of harmony with them. it was a mere falsify 
of the law of aerial perspective, but it startled, almost terrify me. 
we so rely upon the orderly operation of familiar natural law that any 
seeming suspension of them is noted as a menace to our safety, a warning 
of unthinkable calamity. so now the apparently causeless movement of the 
herbage, and the slow, undeviate approach of the line of disturbance 
were distinct disquieting. my companion appear actually frightened, 
and i could hardly credit my senses when i saw him sudden throw his 
gun to his shoulder and fire both barrel at the agitate grass! before 
the smoke of the discharge had clear away i heard a loud savage 
cry--a scream like that of a wild animal--and, fling his gun upon the 
ground, morgan sprang away and ran swift from the spot. at the same 
instant i was thrown violent to the ground by the impact of something 
unseen in the smoke--some soft, heavy substance that seem thrown 
against me with great force. 

"before i could get upon my feet and recover my gun, which seem to 
have been struck from my hands, i heard morgan crying out as if in 
mortal agony, and mingle with his cries were such hoarse savage sound 
as one hear from fight dogs. inexpressible terrified, i struggle to 
my feet and look in the direction of morgan's retreat; and may heaven 
in mercy spare me from another sight like that! at a distance of less 
than thirty yard was my friend, down upon one knee, his head thrown 
back at a frightful angle, hatless, his long hair in disorder and his 
whole body in violent movement from side to side, backward and forward. 
his right arm was lift and seem to lack the hand--at least, i 
could see none. the other arm was invisible. at times, as my memory 
now report this extraordinary scene, i could discern but a part of his 
body; it was as if he had been partly blot out--i can not otherwise 
express it--then a shift of his position would bring it all into view 
again. 

"all this must have occur within a few seconds, yet in that time 
morgan assume all the posture of a determined wrestle vanquish by 
superior weight and strength. i saw nothing but him, and him not always 
distinctly. during the entire incident his shout and curse were heard, 
as if through an envelop uproar of such sound of rage and fury as i 
had never heard from the throat of man or brute! 

"for a moment only i stood irresolute, then, throw down my gun, i 
ran forward to my friend's assistance. i had a vague belief that he was 
suffering from a fit or some form of convulsion. before i could reach 
his side he was down and quiet. all sound had ceased, but, with a 
feeling of such terror as even these awful event had not inspired, i 
now saw the same mysterious movement of the wild oats prolong itself 
from the trample area about the prostrate man toward the edge of 
a wood. it was only when it had reach the wood that i was able to 
withdraw my eyes and look at my companion. he was dead." 




iii 

the coroner rose from his seat and stood beside the dead man. lift 
an edge of the sheet he pull it away, expose the entire body, 
altogether naked and showing in the candle light a clay-like yellow. it 
had, however, broad maculation of bluish-black, obviously cause by 
extravasate blood from contusions. the chest and side look as if 
they had been beaten with a bludgeon. there were dreadful lacerations; 
the skin was torn in strip and shreds. 

the coroner move round to the end of the table and undid a silk 
handkerchief, which had been pass under the chin and knot on the 
top of the head. when the handkerchief was drawn away it expose what 
had been the throat. some of the juror who had risen to get a better 
view repent their curiosity, and turn away their faces. witness 
hark went to the open window and lean out across the sill, faint and 
sick. drop the handkerchief upon the dead man's neck, the coroner 
step to an angle of the room, and from a pile of clothing produce 
one garment after another, each of which he held up a moment for 
inspection. all were torn, and stiff with blood. the juror did not 
make a close inspection. they seem rather uninterested. they had, in 
truth, seen all this before; the only thing that was new to them being 
harker's testimony. 

"gentlemen," the coroner said, "we have no more evidence, i think. your 
duty has been already explain to you; if there is nothing you wish to 
ask you may go outside and consider your verdict." 

the foreman rose--a tall, bearded man of sixty, coarse clad. 

"i should like to ask one question, mr. coroner," he said. "what asylum 
did this yer last witness escape from?" 

"mr. harker," said the coroner, grave and tranquilly, "from what 
asylum did you last escape?" 

hark flushed crimson again, but said nothing, and the seven juror 
rose and solemn file out of the cabin. 

"if you have done insult me, sir," said harker, as soon as he and the 
officer were left alone with the dead man, "i suppose i am at liberty to 
go?" 

"yes." 

hark start to leave, but paused, with his hand on the door latch. 
the habit of his profession was strong in him--stronger than his sense 
of personal dignity. he turn about and said: 

"the book that you have there--i recognize it as morgan's diary. you 
seem greatly interested in it; you read in it while i was testifying. 
may i see it? the public would like--" 

"the book will cut no figure in this matter," reply the official, 
slip it into his coat pocket; "all the entry in it were made 
before the writer's death." 

as hark pass out of the house the jury reentere and stood about the 
table on which the now cover corpse show under the sheet with sharp 
definition. the foreman seat himself near the candle, produce 
from his breast pocket a pencil and scrap of paper, and wrote rather 
laborious the following verdict, which with various degree of effort 
all signed: 

"we, the jury, do find that the remains come to their death at the hand 
of a mountain lion, but some of us thinks, all the same, they had fits." 




iv 

in the diary of the late hugh morgan are certain interesting entry 
having, possibly, a scientific value as suggestions. at the inquest upon 
his body the book was not put in evidence; possibly the coroner thought 
it not worth while to confuse the jury. the date of the first of the 
entry mention can not be ascertained; the upper part of the leaf is 
torn away; the part of the entry remain is as follows: 

"... would run in a half circle, keeping his head turn always toward 
the centre and again he would stand still, bark furiously. at last he 
ran away into the brush as fast as he could go. i thought at first that 
he had gone mad, but on return to the house found no other alteration 
in his manner than what was obviously due to fear of punishment. 

"can a dog see with his nose? do odor impress some olfactory centre 
with image of the thing emit them? . . . 

"sept 2.--looking at the stars last night as they rose above the 
crest of the ridge east of the house, i observe them successive 
disappear--from left to right. each was eclipse but an instant, and 
only a few at the same time, but along the entire length of the ridge 
all that were within a degree or two of the crest were blot out. it 
was as if something had pass along between me and them; but i could 
not see it, and the stars were not thick enough to define its outline. 
ugh! i don't like this. . . ." 

several weeks' entry are missing, three leaves being torn from the 
book. 

"sept. 27.--it has been about here again--i find evidence of its 
presence every day. i watch again all of last night in the same cover, 
gun in hand, double-charged with buckshot. in the morning the fresh 
footprint were there, as before. yet i would have sworn that i did not 
sleep--indeed, i hardly sleep at all. it is terrible, insupportable! if 
these amazing experience are real i shall go mad; if they are fanciful 
i am mad already. 

"oct. 3.--i shall not go--it shall not drive me away. no, this is _my_ 
house, my land. god hate a coward.... 

"oct. 5.--i can stand it no longer; i have invite hark to pass a few 
week with me--he has a level head. i can judge from his manner if he 
think me mad. 

"oct. 7.--i have the solution of the problem; it came to me last 
night--suddenly, as by revelation. how simple--how terribly simple! 

"there are sound that we can not hear. at either end of the scale are 
note that stir no chord of that imperfect instrument, the human ear. 
they are too high or too grave. i have observe a flock of blackbird 
occupy an entire treetop--the tops of several trees--and all in full 
song. suddenly--in a moment--at absolutely the same instant--all 
spring into the air and fly away. how? they could not all see one 
another--whole treetop intervened. at no point could a leader have been 
visible to all. there must have been a signal of warning or command, 
high and shrill above the din, but by me unheard. i have observed, 
too, the same simultaneous flight when all were silent, among not only 
blackbirds, but other birds--quail, for example, widely separate by 
bushes--even on opposite side of a hill. 

"it is known to seamen that a school of whale bask or sporting on 
the surface of the ocean, mile apart, with the convexity of the earth 
between them, will sometimes dive at the same instant--all gone out of 
sight in a moment. the signal has been sounded--too grave for the ear 
of the sailor at the masthead and his comrade on the deck--who 
nevertheless feel its vibration in the ship as the stone of a 
cathedral are stir by the bass of the organ. 

"as with sounds, so with colors. at each end of the solar spectrum the 
chemist can detect the presence of what are known as 'actinic' 
rays. they represent colors--integral colors in the composition of 
light--which we are unable to discern. the human eye is an imperfect 
instrument; its range is but a few octave of the real 'chromatic scale' 
i am not mad; there are colors that we can not see. 

"and, god help me! the damn thing is of such a color!"
