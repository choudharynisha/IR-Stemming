ring once for death 


by robert arthur

_the power of the old gods was certainly nothing for mark 
and edith--a modern, twentieth-century couple--to worry 
about. after all--everybody dies!_ 

* * * * * 




[illustration:] 

twenty years had left no trace inside sam kee's little shop on mott 
street. there were the same dusty jar of ginseng root and tigers' 
whiskers, the same little bronze buddahs, the same gim-cracks mixed 
with fine jade. edith williams gave a little murmur of pleasure as the 
door shut behind them. 

"mark," she said, "it hasn't changed! it doesn't look as if a thing 
had been sold since we were here on our honeymoon." 

"it certainly doesn't," dr. mark williams agreed, moving down the 
narrow aisle behind her. "if someone hadn't told us sam kee was dead, 
i'd believe we'd step back twenty years in time, like they do in 
those scientific story young david reads." 

"we must buy something," his wife said. "for a twentieth anniversary 
present for me. perhaps a bell?" 

from the shadowy depths of the shop a young man emerged, america in 
dress and manner despite the oriental contour of his face and eyes. 

"good evening," he said. "may i show you something?" 

"we think we want a bell," dr. williams chuckled. "but we aren't quite 
sure. you're sam kee's son?" 

"sam kee, junior. my honor father pass to the hall of his 
ancestor five years ago. i could just say that he died--" black eyes 
twinkled--"but customer like the more flowery mode of speech. they 
think it's quaint." 

"i think it's just nice, and not quaint at all," edith williams 
declared. "we're sorry your father is dead. we'd hope to see him 
again. twenty years ago when we were a very broke young couple on a 
honeymoon he sold us a wonderful rose-crystal necklace for half 
price." 

"i'm sure he still made a profit." the black eyes twinkle again. "but 
if you'd like a bell, here are small temple bells, camel bells, dinner 
bells...." 

but even as he spoke, edith williams' hand dart to something at the 
back of the shelf. 

"a bell carve out of crystal!" she exclaimed. "and rose-crystal at 
that. what could be more perfect? a rose-crystal wedding present and a 
rose-crystal anniversary present!" 

the young man half stretch out his hand. 

"i don't think you want that," he said. "it's broken." 

"broken?" edith williams rub off the dust and held the lovely 
bell-shape of crystal, the size of a pear, to the light. "it looks 
perfect to me." 

"i mean it is not complete." something of the america had vanish 
from the young man. "it has no clapper. it will not ring." 

"why, that's right." mark williams took the bell. "the clapper's 
missing." 

"we can have another clapper made," his wife declared. "that is, if 
the original can't be found?" 

the young china shook his head. 

"the bell and the clapper were deliberate separate by my father 
twenty years ago." he hesitated, then added: "my father was afraid of 
this bell." 

"afraid of it?" mark williams raise his eyebrows. 

the other hesitate again. 

"it will probably sound like a story for tourists," he said. "but my 
father believe it. this bell was supposedly stolen from the temple of 
a sect of buddhist somewhere in the mountain of china's interior. 
just as many occidental believe that the christian judgement day will 
be herald by a blast on st. peter's trumpet, so this small sect is 
said to believe that when a bell like this one is rung, a bell carve 
from a single piece of rose crystal, and consecrate by ceremony 
lasting ten years, any dead within sound of it will rise and live 
again." 

"heavenly!" edith williams cried. "and no pun intended. mark, think 
what a help this bell will be in your practise when we make it ring 
again!" to the china she added, smiling: "i'm just tease him. my 
husband is really a very fine surgeon." 

the other bowed his head. 

"i must tell you," he said, "you will not be able to make it ring. 
only the original clapper, carve from the same block of rose crystal, 
will ring it. that is why my father separate them." 

again he hesitated. 

"i have told you only half of what my father told me. he said that, 
though it defeat death, death can not be defeated. rob of his 
chosen victim, he take another in his place. thus when the bell was 
use in the temple of its origin--let us say when a high priest or a 
chief had died--a slave or servant was placed handy for death to take 
when he had been forced to relinquish his grasp upon the important 
one." 

he smiled, shook his head. 

"there," he said. "a preposterous story. now if you wish it, the bell 
is ten dollars. plus, of course, sales tax." 

"the story alone is worth more," dr. williams declared. "i think we'd 
better have it sent, hadn't we, edith? it'll be safe in the mail than 
in our suitcase." 

"sent?" his wife seem to come out of some deep feminine meditation. 
"oh, of course. and as for its not ringing--i shall make it ring. i 
know i shall." 

"if the story is true," mark williams murmured, "i hope not...." 

* * * * * 

the package came on a saturday morning, when mark williams was 
catching up on the latest medical publication in his untidy, 
book-lined study. he heard edith unwrapp paper in the hall outside. 
then she came in with the rose-crystal bell in her hands. 

"mark, it's here!" she said. "now to make it ring." 

she plump herself down beside his desk. he took the bell and reach 
for a silver pencil. 

"just for the sake of curiosity," he remarked, "and not because i 
believe that delightful sales talk we were given, let's see if it will 
ring when i tap. it should, you know." 

he tap the lip of the bell. a muted _thunk_ was the only response. 
then he try with a coin, a paper knife, and the bottom of a glass. 
in each instance the result sound was nothing like a bell ringing. 

"if you've finished, mark," edith said then, with feminine tolerance, 
"let me show you how it's done." 

"gladly," her husband agreed. she took the bell and turn away for a 
moment. then she shook the bell vigorously. a clear, sweet ring 
shiver through the room--so thin and ether that small involuntary 
shivers crawl up his spine. 

"good lord!" he exclaimed. "how did you do that?" 

"i just put the clapper back in place with some thread," edith told 
him. 

"the clapper?" he struck his forehead with his palm. "don't tell 
me--the crystal necklace we bought twenty years ago!" 

"of course." her tone was composed. "as soon as young sam kee told us 
about his father's separate the clapper and the bell, i remember 
the central crystal pendant on my necklace. it _is_ shaped like a bell 
clapper--we mention it once. 

"i guess right away we had the missing clapper. but i didn't say so. 
i want to score on you, mark--" she smile affectionate at 
him--"and because, you know, i had a queer feeling sam kee, junior, 
wouldn't let us have the bell if he guess we had the clapper." 

"i don't think he would." mark williams picked up his pipe and rub 
the bowl with his thumb. "yet he didn't really believe that story he 
told us any more than we do." 

"no, but his father did. and if old sam kee had told it to 
us--remember how wrinkle and wise he seemed?--i do believe we'd have 
believe the story." 

"you're probably right." dr. williams rang the bell and waited. the 
thin, sweet sound seem to hang in the air a long moment, then was 
gone. 

"nope," he said. "nothing happened. although, of course, that may be 
because there was no deceased around to respond." 

"i'm not sure i feel like joke about the story." a small frown 
gather on edith's forehead. "i had plan to use the bell as a 
dinner bell and to tell the story to our guests. but now--i'm not 
sure." 

frowning, she stare at the bell until the ring of the telephone in 
the hall brought her out of her abstraction. 

"sit still, i'll answer." she hurried out. dr. williams, turning the 
rose crystal bell over in his hand, could hear the sudden tension in 
her voice as she answered. he was on his feet when she reentered. 

"an emergency operation at the hospital," she sighed. "nice young 
man--automobile accident. fracture of the skull, dr. amos says. he 
wouldn't have disturbed you but you're the only brain man in town, 
with dr. hendryx away on vacation." 

"i know." he was already in the hall, reach for his hat. "man's 
work is from sun to sun, but a doctor's work is never done," he 
misquoted. 

"i'll drive you." edith follow him out. "you sit back and relax for 
another ten minutes...." 

* * * * * 

two hour later, as they drove homeward, the traffic was light, which 
was fortunate. more than once mark, in a frown abstraction, found 
himself on the left of the center line and had to pull back into his 
own lane. 

he had lost patient before, but never without a feeling of personal 
defeat. edith said he put too much of himself into every operation. 
perhaps he did. and yet--no, there was every reason why the young man 
should have lived. yet, just as mark williams had felt that he had 
been successful, the patient had died. 

in twenty years of marriage, edith williams had learned to read his 
thought at times. now she put a hand comforting on his arm. 

"these things happen, darling," she said. "you know that. a doctor can 
only do so much. some of the job always remains in the hand of 
nature. and she do play trick at times." 

"yes, confound it, i know it," her husband growled. "but i resent 
lose that lad. there was no valid reason for it--unless there was 
some complication i overlooked." he shook his head, scowling. "i 
ordered an autopsy but--yes, i'm go to do that autopsy myself. i'm 
go to turn back and do it now. i have to know!" 

he pull abrupt to the left to swing into a side road and turn. 
edith williams never saw the car that hit them. she heard the frantic 
blare of a horn and a scream of brakes, and in a frozen instant 
realize that there had been someone behind them, about to pass. then 
the impact came, throw her forward into the windshield and 
unconsciousness. 

* * * * * 

edith williams open her eyes. even before she realize that she was 
lie on the ground and that the figure bend over her was a state 
trooper, she remember the crash. her head hurt but there was no 
confusion in her mind. automatically, even as she try to sit up, she 
accept the fact that there had been a crash, help had come, and she 
must have been unconscious for several minutes at least. 

"hey, lady, take it easy!" the trooper protested. "you had a bad bump. 
you got to lie still until the ambulance get here. it'll be along in 
five minutes." 

"mark," edith said, pay no attention. "my husband! is he all 
right?" 

"now lady, please. he's being taken care of. you--" 

but she was not listening. holding to his arm she pull herself to a 
sitting position. she saw their car on its side some yard away, other 
car pull up around them, a little knot of staring people. saw them 
and dismiss them. her gaze found her husband, lie on the ground a 
few feet away, a coat fold beneath his head. 

mark was dead. she had been a doctor's wife for twenty years, and 
before that a nurse. she knew death when she saw it. 

"mark." the word was spoken to herself, but the trooper took it for a 
question. 

"yes, lady," he said. "he's dead. he was still breathing when i got 
here, but he die two, three minutes ago." 

she got to her knees. her only thought was to reach his side. she 
scramble across the few feet of ground to him still on her knee and 
crouch beside him, fumble for his pulse. there was none. there was 
nothing. just a man who had been alive and now was dead. 

behind her she heard a voice raised. she turned. a large, dishevele 
man was standing beside the trooper, talk loudly. 

"now listen, officer," he was saying, "i'm telling you again, it 
wasn't my fault. the guy pull sharp left right in front of me. not a 
thing i could do. it's a wonder we weren't all three of us killed. you 
can see by the mark on their car it wasn't my fault--" 

edith williams closed her mind to the voice. she let mark's hand lie 
in her lap as she fumble in her bag, which was somehow still clutch 
in her fingers. she grope for a handkerchief to stem the tear which 
would not be held back. something was in the way--something smooth and 
hard and cold. she drew it out and heard the thin, sweet tinkle of the 
crystal bell. she must have drop it automatic into her bag as 
they were prepare to leave the house. 

the hand in her lap moved. she gasp and bent forward as her 
husband's eyes opened. 

"mark!" she whispered. "mark, darling!" 

"edith," mark williams said with an effort. "sorry--damned careless of 
me. thinking of the hospital...." 

"you're alive!" she said. "you're _alive_! oh, darling, darling, lie 
still, the ambulance will be here any second." 

"ambulance?" he protested. "i'm all right now. help me--sit up." 

"but mark----" 

"just a bump on the head." he struggle to sit up. the state trooper 
came over. 

"easy, buddy, easy," he said, his voice awed. "we thought you were 
gone. now let's not lose you a second time." his mouth was tight. 

"hey, i'm sure glad you're all right!" the red-faced man said in a 
rush of words. "whew, fellow, you had me all upset, even though it 
wasn't my fault. i mean, how's a guy gonna keep from hit you 
when--when----" 

"catch him!" mark williams cried, but the trooper was too late. the 
other man plunge forward to the ground and lay where he had fallen 
without quivering. 

* * * * * 

the clock in the hall struck two with muted strokes. cautious edith 
williams rose on her elbow and look down at her husband's face. his 
eyes open and look back at her. 

"you're awake," she said, unnecessarily. 

"i woke up a few minutes ago," he answered. "i've been lie 
here--thinking." 

"i'll get you another phenobarbital. dr. amos said for you to take 
them and sleep until tomorrow." 

"i know. i'll take one presently. you know--hearing that clock just 
now remind me of something." 

"yes?" 

"just before i came to this afternoon, after the crash, i had a 
strange impression of hearing a bell ring. it sound so loud in my 
ear i open my eyes to see where it was." 

"a--bell?" 

"yes. just auditory hallucination, of course." 

"but mark--" 

"yes?" 

"a--a bell did ring. i mean, i had the crystal bell in my bag and it 
tinkle a little. do you suppose--" 

"of course not." but though he spoke swift he did not sound 
convincing. "this was a loud bell. like a great gong." 

"but--i mean, mark darling--a moment early you--had no pulse." 

"no pulse?" 

"and you weren't--breathing. then the crystal bell tinkle and 
you--you...." 

"nonsense! i know what you're thinking and believe me--it's nonsense!" 

"but mark." she spoke carefully. "the driver of the other car. you had 
no soon regain consciousness than he--" 

"he had a fracture skull!" dr. williams interrupt sharply. "the 
ambulance intern diagnose it. skull fracture often fail to show 
themselves and then--bingo, you keel over. that's what happened. now 
let's say no more about it." 

"of course." in the hall, the clock struck the quarter hour. "shall i 
fix the phenobarbital now?" 

"yes--no. is david home?" 

she hesitated. "no, he hasn't got back yet." 

"has he phoned? he know he's supposed to be in by midnight at the 
latest." 

"no, he--hasn't phoned. but there's a school dance tonight." 

"that's no excuse for not phoning. he has the old car, hasn't he?" 

"yes. you gave him the key this morning, remember?" 

"all the more reason he should phone." dr. williams lay silent a 
moment. "two o'clock is too late for a 17-year-old boy to be out." 

"i'll speak to him. he won't do it again. now please, mark, let me get 
you the phenobarbital. i'll stay up until david--" 

* * * * * 

the ring phone, a clamor in the darkness, interrupt her. mark 
williams reach for it. the extension was beside his bed. 

"hello," he said. and then, although she could not hear the answer 
voice, she felt him stiffen. and she knew. as well as if she could 
hear the words she knew, with a mother's instinct for disaster. 

"yes," dr. williams said. "yes ... i see ... i understand ... i'll 
come at once.... thank you for calling." 

he slid out of bed before she could stop him. 

"an emergency call." he spoke quietly. "i have to go." he began to 
throw on his clothes. 

"it's david," she said. "isn't it?" she sat up. "don't try to keep me 
from knowing. it's about david." 

"yes," he said. his voice was very tired. "david is hurt. i have to go 
to him. an accident." 

"he's dead." she said it steadily. "david's dead, isn't he, mark?" 

he came over and sat beside her and put his arms around her. 

"edith," he said. "edith--yes, he's dead. forty minutes ago. the 
car--went over a curve. they have him--at the county morgue. they want 
me to--identify him. identify him. edith! you see, the car caught 
fire!" 

"i'm coming with you," she said. "i'm coming with you!" 

* * * * * 

the taxi wait in a pool of dark between two street lights. the 
long, low building which was the county morgue, a blue lamp over its 
door, stood below the street level. a flight of concrete steps went 
down to it from the sidewalk. ten minutes before, dr. mark williams 
had gone down those steps. now he climb back up them, stiffly, 
wearily, like an old man. 

edith was wait in the taxi, sitting forward on the edge of the 
seat, hand clenched. as he reach the last step she open the door 
and step out. 

"mark," she ask shakily, "was it--" 

"yes, it's david." his voice was a monotone. "our son. i've complete 
the formalities. for now the only thing we can do is go home." 

"i'm go to him!" she try to pass. he caught her wrist. discrete 
the taxi driver pretended to doze. 

"no, edith! there's no need. you mustn't--see him!" 

"he's my son!" she cried. "let me go!" 

"no! what have you got under your coat?" 

"it's the bell, the rose-crystal bell!" she cried. "i'm go to ring 
it where david can hear!" 

defiant she brought forth her hand, clutch the little bell. "it 
brought you back, mark! now it's go to bring back david!" 

"edith!" he said in horror. "you mustn't believe that's possible. you 
can't. those were coincidences. now let me have it." 

"no! i'm go to ring it." violent she try to break out of his 
grip. "i want david back! i'm go to ring the bell!" 

she got her hand free. the crystal bell rang in the quiet of the early 
morning with an eerie thinness, penetrating the silence like a silver 
knife. 

"there!" edith williams panted. "i've rung it. i know you don't 
believe, but i do. it'll bring david back." she raise her voice. 
"david!" she called. "david, son! can you hear me?" 

"edith," dr. williams groaned. "you're just torment yourself. come 
home. please come home." 

"not until david has come back.... david, david, can you hear me?" she 
rang the bell again, rang it until dr. williams seize it, then she 
let him take it. 

"edith, edith," he groaned. "if only you had let me come alone...." 

"mark, listen!" 

"what?" 

"listen!" she whisper with fierce urgency. 

he was silent. and then finger of horror drew themselves down his 
spine at the clear, youthful voice that came up to them from the 
dark below. 

"mother?... dad?... where are you?" 

"david!" edith williams breathed. "it's david! let me go! i must go 
to him." 

"no, edith!" her husband whisper frantically, as the voice below 
call again. 

"dad?... mother?... are you up there? wait for me." 

"let me go!" she sobbed. "david, we're here! we're up here, son!" 

"edith!" mark williams gasped. "if you've ever love me, listen to me. 
you mustn't go down there. david--i had to identify him by his class 
ring and his wallet. he was burned--terribly burned!" 

"i'm go to him!" she wrench herself free and sped for the steps, 
up which now was coming a tall form, a shadow shroud in the 
darkness. 

dr. williams, horror knot his stomach, leap to stop her. but he 
slip and fell headlong on the pavement, so that she was able to 
pant down the stairs to meet the upcoming figure. 

"oh, david," she sobbed, "david!" 

"hey, mom!" the boy held her steady. "i'm sorry. i'm terribly sorry. 
but i didn't know what had happen until i got home and you weren't 
there and then one of the fellow from the fraternity call me. i 
realize they must have made a mistake, and you'd come here, and i 
call for a taxi and came out here. my taxi let me off at the 
entrance around the block, and i've been look for you down 
there.... poor pete!" 

"pete?" she asked. 

"pete friedburg. he was driving the old car. i lent him the key and 
my driver's license. i shouldn't have--but he's old and he kept 
beg me...." 

"then--then it's pete who was killed?" she gasped. "pete who 
was--burned?" 

"yes, pete. i feel terrible about lend him the car. but he was 
supposed to be a good driver. and then them calling you, you and dad 
thinking it was me--" 

"then mark was right. of course he was right." she was laugh and 
sob now. "it's just a bell, a pretty little bell, that's all." 

"bell? i don't follow you, mom." 

"never mind," edith williams gasped. "it's just a bell. it hasn't any 
powers over life and death. it doesn't bring back and it doesn't take 
away. but let's get back up to your father. he may be thinking that 
the bell--that the bell really worked." 

they climb the rest of the steps. dr. mark williams still lay where 
he had fallen headlong on the pavement. the cab driver was bend 
over him, but there was nothing to be done. the crystal bell had been 
beneath him when he fell, and it had broken. one long, fine splinter 
of crystal was embed in his heart.
