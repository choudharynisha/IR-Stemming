[sidenote: _a strange and curious story is this, about a banker whose 
only fear was that he might be bury alive, like his grandfather before 
him_] 

preface 
a heavy still hung about the great hall and richly furnish rooms 
of judson mcmasters' residence, and even seem to extend out over the 
velvet lawns, the shrub-lined walk and sun-blotched reach under the 
lacy elm and somber maples. 

biggs glide about the sick-chamber like a specter, apparently strive 
to keep busy, while he cast countless furtive, uneasy glance at the 
heavy figure under the white sheets. an odor of drug and fever taint 
the air, and a small walnut table near the flushed sleeper was laden 
with the familiar prescription bottle, tumbler and box of powders. on 
the wall behind the table, near the head of the bed, hung a small 
oil-painting of napoleon. 

the sleeper stir restlessly, raise himself painful and slowly, and 
attempt to seek fleeting comfort in a new position. at the first 
movement biggs was a shadow at the bedside, deft manipulate the 
covering and gently aid the sick man with a tender born of long 
service and deep affection. as the massive gray head sank into the 
fluff pillow the tired eyes opened, light by a faint glint of 
thankfulness. then they closed again and the once powerful body relaxed. 

with a pitiful, wistful expression on his age face, the faithful biggs 
stood helpless peer at the sick man until hot tear began to course 
down his furrow cheeks, and he turn hasty away. 

"biggs!" 

the voice, still strong and commanding, cut the semi-gloom like a knife. 

biggs, who was about to tuck the heavy curtains still more secure over 
the windows, whirl as though he had touched a live wire, and in a 
flash was across the great room and beside the bed. 

"did you call, sir?" his voice quavered. 

"no"--a faint twinkle light the sick man's eyes--"i just spoke." 

"ah, now sir," cry the overjoyed biggs, "you are better, sir." 

"biggs, i want some air and sunshine." 

"but the doctor, sir----" 

"drat the doctor! if i'm go to pass out i want to see where i'm 
going." 

"oh, but sir," expostulate the old servant, as he part the curtains 
and partially open a case window, "i wish you wouldn't say that, 
sir." 

"i believe in facing a situation squarely, biggs. my father and 
grandfather die from this family malady, and i guess i'm head over 
the same route." 

"please, sir," entreat biggs. 

"biggs, i want to ask you a question." 

"yes, sir?" 

"are you a christian?" 

"i try to be, sir." 

"do you believe in death?" 

biggs was thorough startle and confused. 

"why--a--we all have to die, sometime, sir," he answer haltingly, not 
knowing what else to say. 

"but do we actually die?" insist the sufferer. 

"well, i hope--not yet," venture the old servant. "the doctor said----" 

"forget the doctor," interpose mcmasters. "biggs, you have been in our 
service since i was a lad, haven't you?" 

tear well into the servant's eyes, and his voice faltered. 

"fifty-six years, come next november," he answered. 

"well, let me tell you something, that even in those fifty-six years you 
never learned, biggs. my grandfather was bury alive!" 

"oh, sir! impossible!" cry biggs, in horror. 

"absolutely," assert the banker. 

"why--are you--how do you know, sir?" in a hoarse whisper. 

"my father built a family mausoleum in the far corner of this estate, 
didn't he?" 

"yes, sir--he hate burial in the earth, sir, after reading a poem of 
edgar allan poe's, sir!" 

"what poem was that, biggs?" 

"i don't recall the name of it, but i remember the line," falter 
biggs. 

"what was it?" 

"oh, sir," cry the old man, "let's talk about something cheerful." 

"not until we're through with this discussion, hiram." 

* * * * * 

the sound of his given name restore biggs somewhat, for the banker 
resort to it only on occasion when he share his deepest confidence 
with his old houseman. 

"well, the line goes, 'soft may the worm about him creep,' sir." 

a slight shudder seem to run through mcmasters' body. then after a 
tomb-like silence, "good reason for building the mausoleum." 

"yes, sir, i think so, sir." 

"well," with an apparent effort, "when they exhume my grandfather's 
remains to place them in the new vault, the casket was opened, and----" 

"oh, sir," cry biggs, throw out a trembling, expostulate hand, 
but the banker went on, relentlessly. 

"----the body was turn over, on its side, with the left knee drawn up 
part-way." 

"that's the way he always slept--in life." biggs' voice was a hollow 
whisper. 

"and that's the reason my father, after building himself a mausoleum, 
insist that his body be cremated," said mcmasters. "he took no 
chances." 

biggs' horrify eyes traveled dul to the massive urn over the great 
fireplace and rest there, fascinated. 

"hiram, where is heaven?" 

biggs' eyes flit back to rest in surprize upon the questioner. 

"why, up there, sir," point toward the ceiling. 

"do you believe that the earth rotate on its axis?" 

"that's what i was taught in school, sir." 

"if that hypothesis is true, we are rolling through space at the rate of 
about sixteen mile a minute," figured the banker. "now you say heaven 
is up there." 

"yes, sir." 

"biggs, what time is it?" 

the servant glance at the great clock in the corner. 

"ah, it's twelve o'clock, sir, and time for your medicine," in a voice 
full of relief. 

"never mind the drugs," command mcmasters, "until we finish our 
problem in higher mathematics. now, if i ask you where heaven is at 
midnight, which will be twelve hour from now, where will you point," 
triumphantly. 

"why, up there," reply the bewilder servant, again indicate the 
ceiling. 

"then," cry mcmasters, "you will be point directly opposite from 
the place you indicate a moment ago; for by midnight the earth will 
have turn approximate upside down. do you get my point?" 

"yes, sir," reply poor biggs, thorough befuddled. 

"then where will heaven be at six o'clock this evening?" fairly shout 
the sick man. 

"out there," reply the servant, hopelessly, point toward the 
window. 

"and where will heaven be at six o'clock in the morning?" 

"over there." and biggs pointed a tremble finger at the fireplace. 
then, "oh, sir, let's not--the doctor----" 

"hang the doctor," interrupt mcmaster testily. "i've been thinking 
this thing over, and i've got to talk about it to someone." 

"but don't you believe in a hereafter?" query biggs, a horrible note 
of fear in his pitiful voice. 

for a moment the banker was silent; the massive clock tick solemn 
on. a coal topple with a sputter and flare in the fireplace. 

"yes, hiram," in a thoughtful voice, "i suppose i do." 

"i'm glad to hear you say that," cry biggs in very evident relief. 

"ah, if you could but tell me," continue the banker, "from whence we 
come, and whither we go?" 

"if i knew, sir, i'd be equal with the creator," answer biggs with 
reverence. 

"that's well said, hiram, but it doesn't satisfy me. i've made my place 
in the world by get to the root of things. ah, if i could only get a 
peek behind the curtain, before i go--back-stage, you know--mayhap i 
would not be afraid to die," and his voice fell almost to a whisper. 

"the great director do not permit the audience behind the footlights, 
unless he call them," answer biggs whimsically, the ghost of a smile 
lighting up his trouble features. 

"another thing, biggs, do you believe those story about jonah, and 
lazarus, and the fellow they let down through a hole in the roof to be 
healed?" 

"i do, sir," with conviction. 

"do you understand how it was done?" testily. 

"of course not, sir, being only a human." 

"then tell me, hiram, when you cannot see through it, how can you 
swallow all this theology?" 

"my faith, sir," answer biggs, simply, raise his eyes with 
reverence. 

at this, a quizzical smile came over the sick man's face. 

"in look up, hiram, don't forget, since it is twelve-thirty, that we 
have swung around four hundred and eighty mile from the spot you 
originally designate as the location of the pearly gates." 

"oh, sir, i beg of you," remonstrate the servant, "i cannot bear to 
have you jest on such a--why, master!" he broke off with a little cry, 
rush to his bedside. 

the quizzical smile on the banker's face had sudden faded, and his 
head had fallen feeble back upon the pillow. 

"oh, why did he waste his strength so?" cry biggs, piteously, as with 
tremble hand and tear-blurred eyes he search the little table for 
the smelling-salts. 

after a few breaths, the patient sigh and open his eyes wearily. 

"my medicine, hiram, and then i must rest." 

* * * * * 

at midnight, biggs, doze in a big chair by the fire, was arouse by a 
voice from the sick bed. 

"hiram." 

"yes, sir," scurry to turn on a subdued light. 

"where is heaven now?" 

note the wan flicker of a smile, the old servant pointed solemn 
downward. 

"you are a bright pupil," came in a scarcely audible voice. 

"thank you, sir." 

"do you know, biggs, i wish i had led a different--a better life." 

"you have been a good master, sir. you have been kind, you have given 
liberally to charity," biggs defend him. 

"yes," cynically, "i have given liberally to charity. but it has been no 
sacrifice." 

"you have been a pillar in the church," venture biggs. 

"yes," bitterly, "a stone pillar. i have paid handsome for my pew, and 
slept peaceful through the sermons. i have bought basket of food for 
the poor at thanksgiving and christmas time, only to let other reap the 
happiness of give them away. i could have had so much joy out of 
christmas, if i would. i could have been a jolly, rosy-cheeked santa 
clau and gone to a hundred homes, my arms loaded with gifts." 

"true, sir, but you made that joy possible for others." 

"when i should have known the thrill of it myself. i have not really 
lived, hiram. to draw the sweets truly out of life, one must humble 
himself and serve his fellow men. yes, the scale have fallen from my 
eyes, hiram. but it is too late, 'the spirit is willing but the flesh is 
weak'." 

"it doesn't seem right, sir," said biggs after a pause. 

"what's that, hiram?" 

"why, sir, that you should be stricken down in the prime of life, just 
at a time when you could mean so much to others, while i, old and 
useless, am permit to live on. but i am not finding fault with 
providence, sir," biggs hasten to say; "i just can't find the meaning 
of the riddle, sir." 

"probably i've had my chance and fumble it, biggs." 

"even so, sir, god is not vindictive, according to my ideas. there 
surely is some other solution. i'm still go to pray that he will take 
me in your stead, even if a miracle must be performed." 

"so you have faith in your prayers, do you, biggs?" 

"yes, sir, if they are unselfish prayers." 

"that brand is rather scarce, i take it," answer mcmasters, but his 
tone was reflective rather than sarcastic. 

"oh, sir, i wish you would pray as i do. god would surely understand." 

"rather a queer request, hiram. if my life depend upon your death no 
prayer shall ever pass my lips." 

"but, sir, i'm an old----" 

"however," interrupt mcmasters, "i shall pray that if my life is 
spare in any other fashion, i will make full amends for my years of 
indifference and neglect. and, hiram, no one know how much i truly seek 
this divine dispensation. but i have always scoff at death-bed 
confessions, and so my heart grow cold, for i have no right to 
ask--now." again, wearily, "no right--now." 

"ah, master, god is plenteous in mercy. if you but have the faith, sir, 
it shall make you whole." 

"very good, had i live as you have lived, biggs." then, after a pause, 
"still, the cause is worthy, my heart is right and i shall approach the 
throne. may god be merciful unto me, a sinner." 

"i hope it is not too late yet," falter biggs. "oh, if god would only 
call me in your stead, that you might still do the good work that you 
find it in your heart to do, how gladly would i go." 

a deep sigh was his only answer. 

* * * * * 

a long silence was finally broken by the sick man. but when he spoke, 
his voice was so strange and uncanny that the servant hasten close and 
peer anxious into the fever-flushed face of the sufferer. 

"hiram--i must tell you--a secret," came in a laborious, almost 
sepulchral, whisper. 

biggs came closer. 

"bring a chair and sit down. i must talk to you." 

as the old servant again lean forward, the sufferer hesitated; then 
with an obvious effort he began. 

"hiram, i am go to give you some instruction which you must obey to 
the letter. will you promise to keep them?" 

"i swear it, sir," with great earnestness. 

"good! now, if this fever seal my lip and the doctor pronounce me 
dead----" 

"please, sir," biggs broke in, tear stream down his furrow cheeks, 
but his master continue in the same subdued voice, "whatever happens, i 
am not to be embalmed--do you hear me?--not embalmed, but just laid away 
as i am now." 

"yes, sir," in a choke voice, which fully betray the break heart 
behind it. 

"and now, hiram, the rest of the secret." he pause and beckon biggs 
to lean closer. 

"in my vault--in the mausoleum, i have had an electric button installed. 
that button connect with a silver bell. lift up that small picture of 
napoleon, there upon the wall." 

his hand tremble as with the palsy, biggs reach out and lift 
aside the picture hanging near the head of the bed, and there reveal 
the silver bell, fitted into a small aperture in the wall. then, with a 
sob, he fell back into his chair. 

"hiram"--in a whisper--"after they bury me, you are to sleep in this 
bed." 

with a cry, the old man threw out a horrified, expostulate hand. 
catching it feverishly, the banker half raise himself in bed. 

"don't you understand?" he cry fiercely. "i may not be dead after all. 
remember grandfather! and biggs--if that bell rings, get help--quick!" 

sudden release his hold, mcmaster fell back limp among the 
pillows. 

* * * * * 

all through the long night the faithful biggs maintain a sleepless 
vigil, but the banker lay as immovable as a stone. when the rosy-cheeked 
dawn came peep audacious through the casements, biggs drew the 
heavy curtains tight shut once more. 

not until the doctor's motor whirl away did the patient rouse from his 
lethargy. 

apparently strengthen by his deep stupor he spoke, and biggs stood 
instantly beside him. 

"what did the doctor say?" 

biggs hesitated. 

"out with it, i'm no chicken-hearted weakling." 

"nothing much," admitted biggs, sadly. "he only shook his head very 
gravely." 

"he doesn't understand this family malady any more than the old quack 
who allow my grandfather to be bury alive," said mcmaster almost 
fiercely. 

biggs shudder and put a tremble hand to his eyes. 

"what ail me, biggs?" almost plaintively. "no one knows. this fever has 
baffle the scientist for years. when you fall into a comatose 
condition they call it suspend animation. that's the best thing they 
do--find name for diseases. my family doctor doesn't have any more of 
an idea about this malady than you or i. the average physician is just a 
guesser. he guess you have a fever and prescribe a remedy, hope 
that it will hit the spot. if it doesn't he looks wise, wag his 
head--and try something else on you. maybe it works and maybe it 
doesn't. the only thing my guess is absolutely sure of is that if i 
live or if i die, he will collect a princely fee for his services." 

biggs remain statuesque during the pause. 

"gad," mcmaster broke out again testily, "if i fiddle around in my 
business like that i'd be a pauper in a month." 

"but the doctor say you're coming on," venture biggs. 

"sure he does," answer the banker with a sneer. "that's his stock in 
trade. i know that line of palaver. secretly, he know i am as liable to 
be dead as alive when he come again." 

"oh, sir, you aren't go to die!" 

"that's what i'm afraid of, biggs. but they'll call me dead and go ahead 
and embalm me and make sure of it." 

"oh, sir, i wish----" 

"now remember, biggs," broke in the sick man, "shoot the first 
undertaker that try to put that mummy stuff in my veins." 

"i understand perfectly, sir," answer biggs, fearful lest the other's 
excitement might again give him a turn for the worse. 

"i know i'm apparently go to pass away. my father and grandfather 
both had this cussed virus in their veins, and i don't believe either of 
them was dead when he was pronounced so!" 

"well, if by any chance--that is, if you," began biggs desperately, "if 
you are apparently--dead--why not have them keep your body here in the 
house for a time?" 

"convention, formality, custom, hide-bound law!" the banker fairly 
frothed. "the health authority would come here with an army and see 
that i was buried. no, biggs, i've got a fine crypt out there, all quiet 
and secure, good ventilation, electric lights, like a pullman berth--and 
a push-button. that preclude all notoriety. it's secret and safe. the 
electrician who install the apparatus die four years ago. so you and 
i, alone, possess this knowledge." 

"don't you think someone else should know of it too? your attorney, 
or----" 

"no, biggs. if i really am dead i don't want anyone to write up my 
eccentricity for some sunday magazine sheet. and if i do come back, 
then it will be time to tell the gape public about my cleverness." 

"i wish you weren't so--so cold-blooded about it all, sir." 

"i have always hit straight from the shoulder, hiram, and i'm facing 
this death business as i'd face any other proposition. i'm not ready to 
cash in, and if i can cheat the doctors, undertakers, lawyers, heirs, 
and chief mourner for a few more years, i'm go to do it. and don't 
forget poor old granddad. he might have been up and about yet had he but 
use my scheme." 

* * * * * 

biggs turn away, sick at heart. it was too terrible beyond words. to 
him his religion was as essential as daily bread. death was the 
culmination of cherish belief and constant prayer. as his years 
decline he had face the inevitable day with simple faith that when the 
summons came he would go gladly, like him "who wrap the drapery of his 
couch about him and lie down to pleasant dreams." with throb heart 
he listen for another torrent of words that would still further stab 
his sensitive soul; for he had love and revere his master from his 
youth up. 

but no words came. he wheel about. the massive head had fallen limp 
among the pillows. pallid lip were try to form sentence without 
result. then the great body seem to subside immeasurable deep into 
the cover and a death-like still fell upon the room. 

intuitive feeling that his master was worse than at any previous 
relapse, biggs made every effort to revive him, gently at first, and 
then by vigorous shake and calling to him in a heart-broken, piteous 
voice. but to no avail. the heavy figure look pallid and corpse-like 
under the snowy sheets. 

long hour drag by, and still the lonely old servant sat mute 
beside the bed, only aroused, at last, by the peremptory, measured call 
of the telephone bell. 

"yes," said biggs in a quaver voice. "oh yes, doctor meredith, 
master's rest easy. don't think you'll need to come until tomorrow." 

"i'll keep them away as long as i can," he muttered, as he slip back 
to his vigil. "god grant--maybe he'll come back--and take up the work of 
the master, so long delayed. oh god! if thou wouldst only take me in his 
stead!" 

sleep fitfully, biggs sat dumb through an interminable night, but 
the new day brought no reassure sign from the inert form. the 
still was appalling. the other servant were quarter in a distant 
part of the mansion and only came when summoned. again biggs assured the 
physician that he could gain nothing by calling, and another awful night 
found him, ashen and distraught, at the bedside. sometime in the still 
watches he swoon and kindly nature patch up his shred nerves, 
before consciousness once more arouse him. but the strain was more than 
he could bear. so when the anxious specialist came, unbidden, he found a 
shatter old watchman who broke down completely and babble forth the 
whole mysterious tale, conceal nothing but the secret of the tomb. 

in a coffin previous made to order, they laid the unembalmed remains 
of judson mcmaster in the family mausoleum, and the world which had 
felt his masterful presence for so many years pause long enough to lay 
a costly tribute on his bier and then went smooth on its way. 

not so with the faithful biggs. ensconce in his master's bedroom, he 
nightly toss in trouble sleep, fill with the jangle of 
innumerable electric bells. and when--on the tenth night, after he had 
been somewhat reassure that all was well--he was sudden awaken by a 
mad, incessant ring from the hidden alarm, a deathly weakness 
overcame him and it was some time before he was able to drag his palsied 
body from the bed. with fumbling, clumsy finger he try to hasten, but 
it was many minutes before he tottered, half dressed, out of the room. 
and as he did so, his heart almost stood still, then mount to his 
throat as if to choke him. 

"biggs!"--a voice--mcmaster's voice was calling. 

he stagger to the head of the wide, massive stairway and look down. 
there stood the banker, pale, emaciated, but smiling. 

and then, as from an endless distance, came more words: 

"i forgot to tell you that i had a trap-door in the end of the casket. 
when you didn't answer the bell, i found i could come alone." 

with an inarticulate cry, biggs stretch out his tremble arms. 

"my master, i am coming now." 

then he swayed, stumbled, clutch feeble at the rail and plunge 
headlong to the foot of the stairs, a crumpled, lifeless form.
