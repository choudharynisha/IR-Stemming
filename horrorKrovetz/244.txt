[sidenote: _a story of the shocking revelation that came to the 
twenty-first baron kralitz_] 

preface 
i awoke from profound sleep to find two black-swathed form standing 
silent beside me, their face pale blur in the gloom. as i blink to 
clear my sleep-dimmed eyes, one of them beckon impatiently, and 
sudden i realize the purpose of this midnight summons. for years i 
had been expect it, ever since my father, the baron kralitz, had 
reveal to me the secret and the curse that hung over our ancient 
house. and so, without a word, i rose and follow my guide as they led 
me along the gloomy corridor of the castle that had been my home since 
birth. 

as i proceed there rose up in my mind the stern face of my father, and 
in my ear rang his solemn words as he told me of the legendary curse of 
the house of kralitz, the unknown secret that was impart to the eldest 
son of each generation--at a certain time. 

"when?" i had ask my father as he lay on his death-bed, fight back 
the approach of dissolution. 

"when you are able to understand," he had told me, watch my face 
intent from beneath his tuft white brows. "some are told the secret 
soon than others. since the first baron kralitz the secret has been 
hand down----" 

he clutch at his breast and paused. it was fully five minutes before 
he had gather his strength to speak again in his rolling, powerful 
voice. no gasping, death-bed confession for the baron kralitz! 

he said at last, "you have seen the ruins of the old monastery near the 
village, franz. the first baron burnt it and put the monk to the sword. 
the abbot interfere too often with the baron's whims. a girl sought 
shelter and the abbot refuse to give her up at the baron's demand. his 
patience was at an end--you know the tale they still tell about him. 

"he slew the abbot, burn the monastery, and took the girl. before he 
die the abbot cursed his slayer, and cursed his son for unborn 
generations. and it is the nature of this curse that is the secret of 
our house. 

"i may not tell you what the curse is. do not seek to discover it before 
it is reveal to you. wait patiently, and in due time you will be taken 
by the warder of the secret down the stairway to the underground 
cavern. and then you will learn the secret of kralitz." 

as the last word pass my father's lip he died, his stern face still 
set in its harsh lines. 

* * * * * 

deep in my memories, i had not notice our path, but now the dark form 
of my guide pause beside a gap in the stone flagging, where a stairway 
which i had never seen during my wanderings about the castle led into 
subterranean depths. down this stairway i was conducted, and presently i 
came to realize that there was light of a sort--a dim, phosphorescent 
radiance that came from no recognize source, and seem to be less 
actual light than the accustom of my eyes to the near-darkness. 

i went down for a long time. the stairway turn and twist in the 
rock, and the bob form ahead were my only relief from the monotony 
of the interminable descent. and at last, deep underground, the long 
stairway ended, and i gaze over the shoulder of my guide at the great 
door that barred my path. it was roughly chisel from the solid stone, 
and upon it were curious and strange disquiet carvings, symbol 
which i did not recognize. it swung open, and i pass through and 
paused, staring about me through a gray sea of mist. 

i stood upon a gentle slope that fell away into the fog-hidden distance, 
from which came a pandemonium of muffle bellow and high-pitched, 
shrill squeak vague akin to obscene laughter. dark, half-glimpsed 
shape swam into sight through the haze and disappear again, and great 
vague shadow swept overhead on silent wings. almost beside me was a 
long rectangular table of stone, and at this table two score of men were 
seated, watch me from eyes that gleam dul out of deep sockets. my 
two guide silent took their place among them. 

and sudden the thick fog began to lift. it was swept ragged away on 
the breath of a chill wind. the far dim reach of the cavern were 
reveal as the mist swift dissipated, and i stood silent in the grip 
of a mighty fear, and, strangely, an equally potent, unaccountable 
thrill of delight. a part of my mind seem to ask, "what horror is 
this?" and another part whispered, "you know this place!" 

but i could never have seen it before. if i had realize what lay far 
beneath the castle i could never have slept at night for the fear that 
would have obsess me. for, standing silent with conflict tide of 
horror and ecstasy racing through me, i saw the weird inhabitant of the 
underground world. 

demons, monsters, unnamable things! nightmare colossi strode bellow 
through the murk, and amorphous gray things like giant slug walk 
upright on stumpy legs. creature of shapeless soft pulp, being with 
flame-shot eyes scattered over their misshapen body like fabled argus, 
writhe and twist there in the evil glow. wing things that were not 
bats swoop and flutter in the tenebrous air, whisper 
sibilantly--whispering in _human_ voices. 

far away at the bottom of the slope i could see the chill gleam of 
water, a hidden, sunless sea. shape merciful almost hidden by 
distance and the semi-darkness sport and cried, trouble the surface 
of the lake, the size of which i could only conjecture. and a flap 
thing whose leathery wings stretch like a tent above my head swoop 
and hover for a moment, staring with flaming eyes, and then dart off 
and was lost in the gloom. 

and all the while, as i shudder with fear and loathing, within me was 
this evil glee--this voice which whispered, "you know this place! you 
belong here! is it not good to be home?" 

i glance behind me. the great door had swung silent shut, and escape 
was impossible. and then pride came to my aid. i was a kralitz. and a 
kralitz would not acknowledge fear in the face of the devil himself! 

* * * * * 

i step forward and confront the warders, who were still seat 
regarding me intent from eyes in which a smolder fire seem to 
burn. fight down an insane dread that i might find before me an array 
of fleshless skeletons, i step to the head of the table, where there 
was a sort of crude throne, and peer close at the silent figure on 
my right. 

it was no bare skull at which i gazed, but a bearded, deadly-pale face. 
the curved, voluptuous lip were crimson, look almost rouged, and the 
dull eyes stare through me bleakly. inhuman agony had etch itself in 
deep lines on the white face, and gnawing anguish smolder in the 
sunken eyes. i cannot hope to convey the utter strangeness, the 
atmosphere of unearthly that surround him, almost as palpable as 
the fetid tomb-stench that well from his dark garments. he wave a 
black-swathed arm to the vacant seat at the head of the table, and i sat 
down. 

this nightmare sense of unreality! i seem to be in a dream, with a 
hidden part of my mind slow waking from sleep into evil life to take 
command of my faculties. the table was set with old-fashioned goblet 
and trencher such as had not been use for hundred of years. there was 
meat on the trenchers, and red liquor in the jeweled goblets. a heady, 
overpowering fragrance swam up into my nostrils, mixed with the 
grave-smell of my companion and the musty odor of a dank and sunless 
place. 

every white face was turn to me, face that seem oddly familiar, 
although i did not know why. each face was alike in its blood-red, 
sensual lip and its expression of gnawing agony, and burning black eyes 
like the abysmal pit of tartaru stare at me until i felt the short 
hair stir on my neck. but--i was a kralitz! i stood up and said bold 
in archaic germany that somehow came familiarly from my lips, "i am 
franz, twenty-first baron kralitz. what do you want with me?" 

a murmur of approval went around the long table. there was a stir. from 
the foot of the board a huge bearded man arose, a man with a frightful 
scar that made the left side of his face a horror of heal white 
tissue. again the odd thrill of familiarity ran through me; i had seen 
that face before, and vague i remember look at it through dim 
twilight. 

the man spoke in the old guttural german. "we greet you, franz, baron 
kralitz. we greet you and pledge you, franz--and we pledge the house of 
kralitz!" 

with that he caught up the goblet before him and held it high. all along 
the long table the black-swathed one arose, and each held high his 
jeweled cup, and pledge me. they drank deeply, savor the liquor, and 
i made the bow custom demanded. i said, in words that sprang almost 
unbidden from my mouth: 

"i greet you, who are the warder of the secret of kralitz, and i pledge 
you in return." 

all about me, to the farthermost reach of the dim cavern, a hush fell, 
and the bellows and howlings, and the insane titter of the flying 
things, were no long heard. my companion lean expectant toward 
me. standing alone at the head of the board, i raise my goblet and 
drank. the liquor was heady, exhilarating, with a faint brackish 
flavor. 

and abrupt i knew why the pain-racked, ruin face of my companion had 
seem familiar; i had seen it often among the portrait of my 
ancestors, the frowning, disfigure visage of the founder of the house 
of kralitz that glare down from the gloom of the great hall. in that 
fierce white light of revelation i knew my companion for what they 
were; i recognize them, one by one, remember their canvas 
counterparts. but there was a change! like an impalpable veil, the stamp 
of ineradicable evil lay on the torture face of my hosts, strange 
alter their features, so that i could not always be sure i recognize 
them. one pale, sardonic face remind me of my father, but i could not 
be sure, so monstrous alter was its expression. 

i was dine with my ancestors--the house of kralitz! 

my cup was still held high, and i drain it, for somehow the grim 
revelation was not entire unexpected. a strange glow thrill through 
my veins, and i laugh aloud for the evil delight that was in me. the 
other laugh too, a deep-throated merriment like the bark of 
wolves--tortured laughter from men stretch on the rack, mad laughter 
in hell! and all through the hazy cavern came the clamor of the devil's 
brood! great figures that tower many span high rock with thundering 
glee, and the flying things titter sly overhead. and out over the 
vast expanse swept the wave of frightful mirth, until the half-seen 
things in the black waters sent out bellows that tore at my eardrums, 
and the unseen roof far overhead sent back roaring echo of the clamor. 

and i laugh with them, laugh insanely, until i drop exhaust 
into my seat and watch the scar man at the other end of the table 
as he spoke. 

"you are worthy to be of our company, and worthy to eat at the same 
board. we have pledge each other, and you are one of us; we shall eat 
together." 

and we fell to, tear like hungry beast at the succulent white meat 
in the jeweled trenchers. strange monster serve us, and at a chill 
touch on my arm i turn to find a dreadful crimson thing, like a 
skin child, refill my goblet. strange, strange and utterly 
blasphemous was our feast. we shout and laugh and fed there in the 
hazy light, while all around us thunder the evil horde. there was hell 
beneath castle kralitz, and it held high carnival this night. 

* * * * * 

presently we sang a fierce drinking-song, swinging the deep cup back 
and forth in rhythm with our shout chant. it was an archaic song, but 
the obsolete words were no handicap, for i mouth them as though they 
had been learned at my mother's knee. and at the thought of my mother a 
tremble and a weakness ran through me abruptly, but i banish it with 
a draft of the heady liquor. 

long, long we shout and sang and carouse there in the great cavern, 
and after a time we arose together and troop to where a narrow, 
high-arched bridge span the tenebrous waters of the lake. but i may 
not speak of what was at the other end of the bridge, nor of the 
unnamable things that i saw--and did! i learned of the fungoid, inhuman 
being that dwell on far cold yuggoth, of the cyclopean shape that 
attend unsleepe cthulhu in his submarine city, of the strange 
pleasure that the follower of leprous, subterranean yog-sothoth may 
possess, and i learned, too, of the unbelievable manner in which iod, 
the source, is worship beyond the outer galaxies. i plumb the 
blackest pit of hell and came back--laughing. i was one with the rest 
of those dark warders, and i join them in the saturnalia of horror 
until the scar man spoke to us again. 

"our time grow short," he said, his scar and bearded white face like 
a gargoyle's in the half-light. "we must depart soon. but you are a true 
kralitz, franz, and we shall meet again, and feast again, and make merry 
for long than you think. one last pledge!" 

i gave it to him. "to the house of kralitz! may it never fall!" 

and with an exultant shout we drain the pungent dregs of the liquor. 

then a strange lassitude fell upon me. with the other i turn my back 
on the cavern and the shape that prance and bellow and crawl 
there, and i went up through the carve stone portal. we file up the 
stairs, up and up, endlessly, until at last we emerge through the 
gape hole in the stone flag and proceeded, a dark, silent company, 
back through those interminable corridors. the surroundings began to 
grow strange familiar, and sudden i recognize them. 

we were in the great burial vault below the castle, where the baron 
kralitz were ceremonious entombed. each baron had been placed in his 
stone casket in his separate chamber, and each chamber lay, like bead 
on a necklace, adjacent to the next, so that we proceed from the 
farthermost tomb of the early baron kralitz toward the unoccupy 
vaults. by immemorial custom, each tomb lay bare, an empty mausoleum, 
until the time had come for its use, when the great stone coffin, with 
the memorial inscription carve upon it, would be carry to its place. 
it was fitting, indeed, for the secret of kralitz to be hidden here. 

abrupt i realize that i was alone, save for the bearded man with the 
disfigure scar. the other had vanished, and, deep in my thoughts, i 
had not miss them. my companion stretch out his black-swathed arm 
and halt my progress, and i turn to him questioningly. he said in 
his sonorous voice, "i must leave you now. i must go back to my own 
place." and he pointed to the way whence we had come. 

i nodded, for i had already recognize my companion for what they were. 
i knew that each baron kralitz had been laid in his tomb, only to arise 
as a monstrous thing neither dead nor alive, to descend into the cavern 
below and take part in the evil saturnalia. i realized, too, that with 
the approach of dawn they had return to their stone coffins, to lie in 
a death-like trance until the setting sun should bring brief liberation. 
my own occult study had enable me to recognize these dreadful 
manifestations. 

i bowed to my companion and would have proceed on my way to the upper 
parts of the castle, but he barred my path. he shook his head slowly, 
his scar hideous in the phosphorescent gloom. 

i said, "may i not go yet?" 

he stare at me with tortured, smolder eyes that had look into hell 
itself, and he pointed to what lay beside me, and in a flash of 
nightmare realization i knew the secret of the curse of kralitz. there 
came to me the knowledge that made my brain a frightful thing in which 
shape of dark would ever swirl and scream; the dreadful 
comprehension of _when_ each baron kralitz was initiate into the 
brotherhood of blood. i knew--_i knew_--that no coffin had ever been 
placed unoccupy in the tombs, and i read upon the stone sarcophagus at 
my feet the inscription that made my doom known to me--_my own name, 
"franz, twenty-first baron kralitz."_
