the monkey's paw 


i. 
preface 
without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of laburnam 
villa the blind were drawn and the fire burn brightly. father and son 
were at chess, the former, who possessed idea about the game involve 
radical changes, putt his king into such sharp and unnecessary peril 
that it even provoke comment from the white-haired old lady knitting 
placid by the fire. 

"hark at the wind," said mr. white, who, have seen a fatal mistake 
after it was too late, was amiable desirous of prevent his son from 
seeing it. 

"i'm listening," said the latter, grim survey the board as he 
stretch out his hand. "check." 

"i should hardly think that he'd come to-night," said his father, with 
his hand poised over the board. 

"mate," reply the son. 

"that's the worst of living so far out," bawl mr. white, with sudden 
and unlooked-for violence; "of all the beastly, slushy, out-of-the-way 
place to live in, this is the worst. pathway's a bog, and the road's a 
torrent. i don't know what people are thinking about. i suppose because 
only two house in the road are let, they think it doesn't matter." 

"never mind, dear," said his wife, soothingly; "perhaps you'll win the 
next one." 

mr. white look up sharply, just in time to intercept a knowing glance 
between mother and son. the words die away on his lips, and he hid a 
guilty grin in his thin grey beard. 

"there he is," said herbert white, as the gate bang to loud and heavy 
footstep came toward the door. 

the old man rose with hospitable haste, and opening the door, was heard 
condole with the new arrival. the new arrival also condole with 
himself, so that mrs. white said, "tut, tut!" and cough gently as her 
husband enter the room, follow by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and 
rubicund of visage. 

"sergeant-major morris," he said, introduce him. 

the sergeant-major shook hands, and taking the proffer seat by the 
fire, watch contented while his host got out whiskey and tumbler and 
stood a small copper kettle on the fire. 

at the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the 
little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from 
distant parts, as he square his broad shoulder in the chair and spoke 
of wild scene and doughty deeds; of war and plague and strange 
peoples. 

"twenty-one years of it," said mr. white, nod at his wife and son. 
"when he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. now look 
at him." 

"he don't look to have taken much harm," said mrs. white, politely. 

"i'd like to go to india myself," said the old man, "just to look round a 
bit, you know." 

"better where you are," said the sergeant-major, shake his head. he 
put down the empty glass, and sigh softly, shook it again. 

"i should like to see those old temple and fakir and jugglers," said 
the old man. "what was that you start telling me the other day about a 
monkey's paw or something, morris?" 

"nothing," said the soldier, hastily. "leastways nothing worth hearing." 

"monkey's paw?" said mrs. white, curiously. 

"well, it's just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps," said the 
sergeant-major, offhandedly. 

his three listener lean forward eagerly. the visitor absent-mindedly 
put his empty glass to his lip and then set it down again. his host 
fill it for him. 

"to look at," said the sergeant-major, fumble in his pocket, "it's just 
an ordinary little paw, dry to a mummy." 

he took something out of his pocket and proffer it. mrs. white drew 
back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examine it curiously. 

"and what is there special about it?" inquire mr. white as he took it 
from his son, and have examine it, placed it upon the table. 

"it had a spell put on it by an old fakir," said the sergeant-major, 
"a very holy man. he want to show that fate rule people's lives, and 
that those who interfere with it did so to their sorrow. he put a spell 
on it so that three separate men could each have three wish from it." 

his manner was so impressive that his hearer were conscious that their 
light laughter jar somewhat. 

"well, why don't you have three, sir?" said herbert white, cleverly. 

the soldier regard him in the way that middle age is wont to regard 
presumptuous youth. "i have," he said, quietly, and his blotchy face 
whitened. 

"and did you really have the three wish granted?" ask mrs. white. 

"i did," said the sergeant-major, and his glass tap against his strong 
teeth. 

"and has anybody else wished?" persist the old lady. 

"the first man had his three wishes. yes," was the reply; "i don't know 
what the first two were, but the third was for death. that's how i got 
the paw." 

his tone were so grave that a hush fell upon the group. 

"if you've had your three wishes, it's no good to you now, then, morris," 
said the old man at last. "what do you keep it for?" 

the soldier shook his head. "fancy, i suppose," he said, slowly. "i did 
have some idea of sell it, but i don't think i will. it has cause 
enough mischief already. besides, people won't buy. they think it's a 
fairy tale; some of them, and those who do think anything of it want to 
try it first and pay me afterward." 

"if you could have another three wishes," said the old man, eye him 
keenly, "would you have them?" 

"i don't know," said the other. "i don't know." 

he took the paw, and dangle it between his forefinger and thumb, 
sudden threw it upon the fire. white, with a slight cry, stoop down 
and snatch it off. 

"better let it burn," said the soldier, solemnly. 

"if you don't want it, morris," said the other, "give it to me." 

"i won't," said his friend, doggedly. "i threw it on the fire. if you 
keep it, don't blame me for what happens. pitch it on the fire again 
like a sensible man." 

the other shook his head and examine his new possession closely. "how 
do you do it?" he inquired. 

"hold it up in your right hand and wish aloud," said the sergeant-major, 
"but i warn you of the consequences." 

"sounds like the arabia nights," said mrs. white, as she rose and began 
to set the supper. "don't you think you might wish for four pair of 
hand for me?" 

her husband drew the talisman from pocket, and then all three burst into 
laughter as the sergeant-major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught 
him by the arm. 

"if you must wish," he said, gruffly, "wish for something sensible." 

mr. white drop it back in his pocket, and place chairs, motion his 
friend to the table. in the business of supper the talisman was partly 
forgotten, and afterward the three sat listen in an enthrall fashion 
to a second instalment of the soldier's adventure in india. 

"if the tale about the monkey's paw is not more truthful than those he 
has been telling us," said herbert, as the door closed behind their 
guest, just in time for him to catch the last train, "we sha'nt make much 
out of it." 

"did you give him anything for it, father?" inquire mrs. white, 
regarding her husband closely. 

"a trifle," said he, colouring slightly. "he didn't want it, but i made 
him take it. and he pressed me again to throw it away." 

"likely," said herbert, with pretended horror. "why, we're go to be 
rich, and famous and happy. wish to be an emperor, father, to begin 
with; then you can't be henpecked." 

he dart round the table, pursue by the malign mrs. white armed with 
an antimacassar. 

mr. white took the paw from his pocket and eye it dubiously. "i don't 
know what to wish for, and that's a fact," he said, slowly. "it seem to 
me i've got all i want." 

"if you only clear the house, you'd be quite happy, wouldn't you?" 
said herbert, with his hand on his shoulder. "well, wish for two hundred 
pounds, then; that 'll just do it." 

his father, smile shamefaced at his own credulity, held up the 
talisman, as his son, with a solemn face, somewhat mar by a wink at 
his mother, sat down at the piano and struck a few impressive chords. 

"i wish for two hundred pounds," said the old man distinctly. 

a fine crash from the piano greet the words, interrupt by a 
shudder cry from the old man. his wife and son ran toward him. 

"it moved," he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on 
the floor. 

"as i wished, it twist in my hand like a snake." 

"well, i don't see the money," said his son as he picked it up and placed 
it on the table, "and i bet i never shall." 

"it must have been your fancy, father," said his wife, regarding him 
anxiously. 

he shook his head. "never mind, though; there's no harm done, but it 
gave me a shock all the same." 

they sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes. 
outside, the wind was higher than ever, and the old man start nervous 
at the sound of a door bang upstairs. a silence unusual and 
depress settled upon all three, which last until the old couple rose 
to retire for the night. 

"i expect you'll find the cash tie up in a big bag in the middle of your 
bed," said herbert, as he bade them good-night, "and something horrible 
squat up on top of the wardrobe watch you as you pocket your 
ill-gotten gains." 

he sat alone in the darkness, gaze at the die fire, and seeing face 
in it. the last face was so horrible and so simian that he gaze at it 
in amazement. it got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt 
on the table for a glass contain a little water to throw over it. his 
hand grasp the monkey's paw, and with a little shiver he wipe his hand 
on his coat and went up to bed. 



ii. 

in the bright of the wintry sun next morning as it stream over the 
breakfast table he laugh at his fears. there was an air of prosaic 
wholesome about the room which it had lack on the previous night, 
and the dirty, shrivel little paw was pitch on the sideboard with a 
careless which betoken no great belief in its virtues. 

"i suppose all old soldier are the same," said mrs. white. "the idea of 
our listen to such nonsense! how could wish be grant in these 
days? and if they could, how could two hundred pound hurt you, father?" 

"might drop on his head from the sky," said the frivolous herbert. 

"morris said the things happen so naturally," said his father, "that 
you might if you so wish attribute it to coincidence." 

"well, don't break into the money before i come back," said herbert as he 
rose from the table. "i'm afraid it'll turn you into a mean, avaricious 
man, and we shall have to disown you." 

his mother laughed, and following him to the door, watch him down the 
road; and return to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense 
of her husband's credulity. all of which did not prevent her from 
scurry to the door at the postman's knock, nor prevent her from 
refer somewhat shortly to retired sergeant-majors of bibulous habit 
when she found that the post brought a tailor's bill. 

"herbert will have some more of his funny remarks, i expect, when he 
come home," she said, as they sat at dinner. 

"i dare say," said mr. white, pour himself out some beer; "but for all 
that, the thing move in my hand; that i'll swear to." 

"you thought it did," said the old lady soothingly. 

"i say it did," reply the other. "there was no thought about it; i had 
just---- what's the matter?" 

his wife made no reply. she was watch the mysterious movements of a 
man outside, who, peer in an undecided fashion at the house, appear 
to be try to make up his mind to enter. in mental connection with the 
two hundred pounds, she notice that the stranger was well dressed, and 
wore a silk hat of glossy newness. three times he pause at the gate, 
and then walk on again. the fourth time he stood with his hand upon 
it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walk up the path. 
mrs. white at the same moment placed her hand behind her, and hurried 
unfastene the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel 
beneath the cushion of her chair. 

she brought the stranger, who seem ill at ease, into the room. he 
gaze at her furtively, and listen in a preoccupied fashion as the old 
lady apologize for the appearance of the room, and her husband's coat, a 
garment which he usually reserved for the garden. she then wait as 
patient as her sex would permit, for him to broach his business, but he 
was at first strange silent. 

"i--was ask to call," he said at last, and stoop and picked a piece 
of cotton from his trousers. "i come from 'maw and meggins.'" 

the old lady started. "is anything the matter?" she asked, 
breathlessly. "has anything happen to herbert? what is it? what is 
it?" 

her husband interposed. "there, there, mother," he said, hastily. "sit 
down, and don't jump to conclusions. you've not brought bad news, i'm 
sure, sir;" and he eye the other wistfully. 

"i'm sorry--" began the visitor. 

"is he hurt?" demand the mother, wildly. 

the visitor bowed in assent. "badly hurt," he said, quietly, "but he is 
not in any pain." 

"oh, thank god!" said the old woman, clasp her hands. "thank god for 
that! thank--" 

she broke off sudden as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawn 
upon her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fear in the other's 
avert face. she caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted 
husband, laid her tremble old hand upon his. there was a long silence. 

"he was caught in the machinery," said the visitor at length in a low 
voice. 

"caught in the machinery," repeated mr. white, in a daze fashion, "yes." 

he sat staring blank out at the window, and taking his wife's hand 
between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old 
courting-days nearly forty years before. 

"he was the only one left to us," he said, turning gently to the visitor. 
"it is hard." 

the other coughed, and rising, walk slow to the window. "the firm 
wish me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss," 
he said, without look round. "i beg that you will understand i am 
only their servant and merely obey orders." 

there was no reply; the old woman's face was white, her eyes staring, and 
her breath inaudible; on the husband's face was a look such as his friend 
the sergeant might have carry into his first action. 

"i was to say that 'maw and meggins' disclaim all responsibility," 
continue the other. "they admit no liability at all, but in 
consideration of your son's services, they wish to present you with 
a certain sum as compensation." 

mr. white drop his wife's hand, and rising to his feet, gaze with a 
look of horror at his visitor. his dry lip shaped the words, "how 
much?" 

"two hundred pounds," was the answer. 

unconscious of his wife's shriek, the old man smile faintly, put out his 
hand like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor. 


iii. 

in the huge new cemetery, some two mile distant, the old people bury 
their dead, and came back to a house steep in shadow and silence. it 
was all over so quick that at first they could hardly realize it, and 
remain in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen 
--something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old heart 
to bear. 

but the days passed, and expectation gave place to resignation--the 
hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes miscalled, apathy. sometimes 
they hardly exchange a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and 
their days were long to weariness. 

it was about a week after that the old man, waking sudden in the night, 
stretch out his hand and found himself alone. the room was in 
darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. he 
raise himself in bed and listened. 

"come back," he said, tenderly. "you will be cold." 

"it is cold for my son," said the old woman, and wept afresh. 

the sound of her sob die away on his ears. the bed was warm, and his 
eyes heavy with sleep. he doze fitfully, and then slept until a sudden 
wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start. 

"the paw!" she cry wildly. "the monkey's paw!" 

he start up in alarm. "where? where is it? what's the matter?" 

she came stumble across the room toward him. "i want it," she said, 
quietly. "you've not destroy it?" 

"it's in the parlour, on the bracket," he replied, marvelling. "why?" 

she cry and laugh together, and bend over, kiss his cheek. 

"i only just thought of it," she said, hysterically. "why didn't i think 
of it before? why didn't you think of it?" 

"think of what?" he questioned. 

"the other two wishes," she replied, rapidly. "we've only had one." 

"was not that enough?" he demanded, fiercely. 

"no," she cried, triumphantly; "we'll have one more. go down and get it 
quickly, and wish our boy alive again." 

the man sat up in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quake limbs. 
"good god, you are mad!" he cried, aghast. 

"get it," she panted; "get it quickly, and wish--oh, my boy, my boy!" 

her husband struck a match and lit the candle. "get back to bed," he 
said, unsteadily. "you don't know what you are saying." 

"we had the first wish granted," said the old woman, feverishly; "why not 
the second?" 

"a coincidence," stammer the old man. 

"go and get it and wish," cry his wife, quiver with excitement. 

the old man turn and regard her, and his voice shook. "he has been 
dead ten days, and besides he--i would not tell you else, but--i could 
only recognize him by his clothing. if he was too terrible for you to 
see then, how now?" 

"bring him back," cry the old woman, and drag him toward the door. 
"do you think i fear the child i have nursed?" 

he went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then 
to the mantelpiece. the talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear 
that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilate son before him ere he 
could escape from the room seize upon him, and he caught his breath as 
he found that he had lost the direction of the door. his brow cold with 
sweat, he felt his way round the table, and grope along the wall until 
he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his 
hand. 

even his wife's face seem change as he enter the room. it was white 
and expectant, and to his fear seem to have an unnatural look upon it. 
he was afraid of her. 

"wish!" she cried, in a strong voice. 

"it is foolish and wicked," he faltered. 

"wish!" repeated his wife. 

he raise his hand. "i wish my son alive again." 

the talisman fell to the floor, and he regard it fearfully. then he 
sank tremble into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walk 
to the window and raise the blind. 

he sat until he was chill with the cold, glancing occasional at the 
figure of the old woman peer through the window. the candle-end, 
which had burn below the rim of the china candlestick, was throw 
pulsate shadow on the ceiling and walls, until, with a flicker large 
than the rest, it expired. the old man, with an unspeakable sense of 
relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back to his bed, and a 
minute or two afterward the old woman came silent and apathetic 
beside him. 

neither spoke, but lay silent listen to the ticking of the clock. a 
stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurry noisy through the wall. 
the dark was oppressive, and after lie for some time screw up 
his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went 
downstairs for a candle. 

at the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he pause to strike 
another; and at the same moment a knock, so quiet and stealthy as to be 
scarcely audible, sound on the front door. 

the match fell from his hand and spill in the passage. he stood 
motionless, his breath suspend until the knock was repeated. then he 
turn and flee swift back to his room, and closed the door behind him. 
a third knock sound through the house. 

"what's that?" cry the old woman, start up. 

"a rat," said the old man in shake tones--"a rat. it pass me on the 
stairs." 

his wife sat up in bed listening. a loud knock resound through the 
house. 

"it's herbert!" she screamed. "it's herbert!" 

she ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by 
the arm, held her tightly. 

"what are you go to do?" he whisper hoarsely. 

"it's my boy; it's herbert!" she cried, struggle mechanically. 
"i forgot it was two mile away. what are you holding me for? let go. 
i must open the door." 

"for god's sake don't let it in," cry the old man, trembling. 

"you're afraid of your own son," she cried, struggling. "let me go. i'm 
coming, herbert; i'm coming." 

there was another knock, and another. the old woman with a sudden wrench 
broke free and ran from the room. her husband follow to the landing, 
and call after her appealing as she hurried downstairs. he heard the 
chain rattle back and the bottom bolt drawn slow and stiff from the 
socket. then the old woman's voice, strained and panting. 

"the bolt," she cried, loudly. "come down. i can't reach it." 

but her husband was on his hand and knee grope wildly on the floor in 
search of the paw. if he could only find it before the thing outside got 
in. a perfect fusillade of knock reverberate through the house, and he 
heard the scrape of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage 
against the door. he heard the creak of the bolt as it came slow 
back, and at the same moment he found the monkey's paw, and frantic 
breathe his third and last wish. 

the knock cease suddenly, although the echo of it were still in the 
house. he heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. a cold wind 
rush up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappointment and 
misery from his wife gave him courage to run down to her side, and then 
to the gate beyond. the street lamp flicker opposite shone on a quiet 
and desert road.
