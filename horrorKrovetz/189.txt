the cask of amontillado 


by 

edgar allan poe 


preface 
the thousand injury of fortunato i had borne as i best could, but 
when he venture upon insult, i vow revenge. you, who so well know 
the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that i gave utterance 
to a threat. _at length_ i would be avenged; this was a point definitely 
settled--but the very definitive with which it was resolved, 
preclude the idea of risk. i must not only punish, but punish with 
impunity. a wrong is unredress when retribution overtake its 
redresser. it is equally unredress when the avenge fail to make 
himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong. 

it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given 
fortunato cause to doubt my good will. i continued, as was my wont, to 
smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was at 
the thought of his immolation. 

he had a weak point--this fortunato--although in other regards he was a 
man to be respect and even feared. he pride himself on his 
connoisseurship in wine. few italy have the true virtuoso spirit. 
for the most part their enthusiasm is adopt to suit the time and 
opportunity--to practise imposture upon the britain and austria 
_millionaires_. in painting and gemmary, fortunato, like his countrymen, 
was a quack--but in the matter of old wine he was sincere. in this 
respect i did not differ from him materially: i was skillful in the 
italy vintage myself, and bought largely whenever i could. 

it was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the 
carnival season, that i encounter my friend. he accost me with 
excessive warmth, for he had been drink much. the man wore motley. 
he had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was 
surmount by the conical cap and bells. i was so pleased to see him, 
that i thought i should never have done wring his hand. 

i said to him--"my dear fortunato, you are lucky met. how remarkably 
well you are look to-day! but i have received a pipe of what pass 
for amontillado, and i have my doubts." 

"how?" said he. "amontillado? a pipe? impossible! and in the middle 
of the carnival!" 

"i have my doubts," i replied; "and i was silly enough to pay the full 
amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. you were not to 
be found, and i was fearful of lose a bargain." 

"amontillado!" 

"i have my doubts." 

"amontillado!" 

"and i must satisfy them." 

"amontillado!" 

"as you are engaged, i am on my way to luchesi. if any one has a 
critical turn, it is he. he will tell me--" 

"luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry." 

"and yet some fool will have it that his taste is a match for your 
own." 

"come, let us go." 

"whither?" 

"to your vaults." 

"my friend, no; i will not impose upon your good nature. i perceive 
you have an engagement. luchesi--" 

"i have no engagement;--come." 

"my friend, no. it is not the engagement, but the severe cold with 
which i perceive you are afflicted. the vault are insufferable damp. 
they are encrust with nitre." 

"let us go, nevertheless. the cold is merely nothing. amontillado! 
you have been impose upon. and as for luchesi, he cannot distinguish 
sherry from amontillado." 

thus speaking, fortunato possessed himself of my arm. putt on a mask 
of black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ close about my person, i 
suffer him to hurry me to my palazzo. 

there were no attendant at home; they had abscond to make merry in 
honour of the time. i had told them that i should not return until the 
morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. 
these orders were sufficient, i well knew, to insure their immediate 
disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned. 

i took from their sconce two flambeaux, and give one to fortunato, 
bowed him through several suite of rooms to the archway that led into 
the vaults. i pass down a long and winding staircase, request him 
to be cautious as he followed. we came at length to the foot of the 
descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacomb of the 
montresors. 

the gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bell upon his cap jingle 
as he strode. 

"the pipe," said he. 

"it is farther on," said i; "but observe the white web-work which 
gleam from these cavern walls." 

he turn towards me, and look into my eyes with two filmy orb that 
distill the rheum of intoxication. 

"nitre?" he asked, at length. 

"nitre," i replied. "how long have you had that cough?" 

"ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! 
ugh! ugh!" 

my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes. 

"it is nothing," he said, at last. 

"come," i said, with decision, "we will go back; your health is 
precious. you are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as 
once i was. you are a man to be missed. for me it is no matter. we 
will go back; you will be ill, and i cannot be responsible. besides, 
there is luchesi--" 

"enough," he said; "the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. 
i shall not die of a cough." 

"true--true," i replied; "and, indeed, i had no intention of alarm 
you unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. a draught of 
this medoc will defend us from the damps." 

here i knock off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long row of 
its fellow that lay upon the mould. 

"drink," i said, present him the wine. 

he raise it to his lip with a leer. he pause and nod to me 
familiarly, while his bell jingled. 

"i drink," he said, "to the bury that repose around us." 

"and i to your long life." 

he again took my arm, and we proceeded. 

"these vaults," he said, "are extensive." 

"the montresors," i replied, "were a great and numerous family." 

"i forget your arms." 

"a huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crush a serpent 
rampant whose fang are imbed in the heel." 

"and the motto?" 

"_nemo me impune lacessit_." 

"good!" he said. 

the wine sparkle in his eyes and the bell jingled. my own fancy grew 
warm with the medoc. we had pass through wall of pile bones, with 
cask and puncheon intermingling, into the inmost recess of 
catacombs. i pause again, and this time i made bold to seize 
fortunato by an arm above the elbow. 

"the nitre!" i said; "see, it increases. it hang like moss upon the 
vaults. we are below the river's bed. the drops of moisture trickle 
among the bones. come, we will go back ere it is too late. your 
cough--" 

"it is nothing," he said; "let us go on. but first, another draught of 
the medoc." 

i broke and reach him a flagon of de grave. he empty it at a 
breath. his eyes flash with a fierce light. he laugh and threw 
the bottle upwards with a gesticulate i did not understand. 

i look at him in surprise. he repeated the movement--a grotesque one. 

"you do not comprehend?" he said. 

"not i," i replied. 

"then you are not of the brotherhood." 

"how?" 

"you are not of the masons." 

"yes, yes," i said; "yes, yes." 

"you? impossible! a mason?" 

"a mason," i replied. 

"a sign," he said, "a sign." 

"it is this," i answered, produce a trowel from beneath the fold of 
my _roquelaire_. 

"you jest," he exclaimed, recoil a few paces. "but let us proceed 
to the amontillado." 

"be it so," i said, replace the tool beneath the cloak and again 
offering him my arm. he lean upon it heavily. we continue our 
route in search of the amontillado. we pass through a range of low 
arches, descended, pass on, and descend again, arrive at a deep 
crypt, in which the foul of the air cause our flambeaux rather to 
glow than flame. 

at the most remote end of the crypt there appear another less 
spacious. its wall had been line with human remains, pile to the 
vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacomb of paris. three 
side of this interior crypt were still ornament in this manner. 
from the fourth side the bone had been thrown down, and lay 
promiscuous upon the earth, form at one point a mound of some 
size. within the wall thus expose by the displace of the bones, we 
perceive a still interior recess, in depth about four feet in width 
three, in height six or seven. it seem to have been construct for 
no especial use within itself, but form merely the interval between 
two of the colossal support of the roof of the catacombs, and was 
back by one of their circumscribe wall of solid granite. 

it was in vain that fortunato, uplift his dull torch, endeavour to 
pry into the depth of the recess. its termination the feeble light did 
not enable us to see. 

"proceed," i said; "herein is the amontillado. as for luchesi--" 

"he is an ignoramus," interrupt my friend, as he step unsteadi 
forward, while i follow immediately at his heels. in an instant he 
had reach the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress 
arrest by the rock, stood stupid bewildered. a moment more and i 
had fetter him to the granite. in its surface were two iron staples, 
distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. from one of 
these depend a short chain, from the other a padlock. throw the 
links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure 
it. he was too much astound to resist. withdraw the key i 
step back from the recess. 

"pass your hand," i said, "over the wall; you cannot help feeling the 
nitre. indeed, it is _very_ damp. once more let me _implore_ you to 
return. no? then i must positively leave you. but i must first 
render you all the little attention in my power." 

"the amontillado!" ejaculate my friend, not yet recover from his 
astonishment. 

"true," i replied; "the amontillado." 

as i said these words i busy myself among the pile of bone of which 
i have before spoken. throw them aside, i soon uncover a quantity 
of building stone and mortar. with these material and with the aid of 
my trowel, i began vigorous to wall up the entrance of the niche. 

i had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when i discover 
that the intoxicate of fortunato had in a great measure worn off. the 
earliest indication i had of this was a low moan cry from the depth 
of the recess. it was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. there was then a 
long and obstinate silence. i laid the second tier, and the third, and 
the fourth; and then i heard the furious vibration of the chain. the 
noise last for several minutes, during which, that i might hearken to 
it with the more satisfaction, i cease my labour and sat down upon 
the bones. when at last the clank subsided, i resume the trowel, 
and finished without interrupt the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh 
tier. the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. i again 
paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few 
feeble ray upon the figure within. 

a succession of loud and shrill screams, burst sudden from the 
throat of the chain form, seem to thrust me violent back. for a 
brief moment i hesitated--i trembled. unsheath my rapier, i began 
to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant 
reassure me. i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, 
and felt satisfied. i reapproache the wall; i reply to the yell of 
him who clamoured. i re-echoed--i aided--i surpass them in volume 
and in strength. i did this, and the clamour grew still. 

it was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. i had 
complete the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. i had finished a 
portion of the last and the eleventh; there remain but a single stone 
to be fitted and plastered in. i struggle with its weight; i placed 
it partially in its destined position. but now there came from out the 
niche a low laugh that erect the hair upon my head. it was 
succeed by a sad voice, which i had difficulty in recognize as that 
of the noble fortunato. the voice said-- 

"ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. 
we shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! 
he!--over our wine--he! he! he!" 

"the amontillado!" i said. 

"he! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the amontillado. but is it not get 
late? will not they be await us at the palazzo, the lady fortunato 
and the rest? let us be gone." 

"yes," i said, "let us be gone." 

"_for the love of god, montresor!_" 

"yes," i said, "for the love of god!" 

but to these words i hearken in vain for a reply. i grew impatient. 
i call aloud-- 

"fortunato!" 

no answer. i call again-- 

"fortunato--" 

no answer still. i thrust a torch through the remain aperture and 
let it fall within. there came forth in reply only a jingle of the 
bells. my heart grew sick on account of the damp of the catacombs. 
i hasten to make an end of my labour. i forced the last stone into 
its position; i plastered it up. against the new masonry i re-erected 
the old rampart of bones. for the half of a century no mortal has 
disturbed them. _in pace requiescat!_
