the masqu of the red death 


by 

edgar allan poe 



prefac 
the "red death" had long devast the country. No pestil had 
ever been so fatal, or so hideous. blood wa it avatar and it 
seal--th red and the horror of blood. there were sharp pains, and 
sudden dizziness, and then profus bleed at the pores, with 
dissolution. the scarlet stain upon the bodi and especi upon the 
face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid 
and from the sympathi of hi fellow-men. and the whole seizure, 
progress and termin of the disease, were the incid of half an 
hour. 

but the princ prospero wa happi and dauntless and sagacious. when hi 
dominion were half depopulated, he summon to hi presenc a thousand 
hale and light-heart friend from among the knight and dame of hi 
court, and with these retir to the deep seclus of one of hi 
castel abbeys. thi wa an extens and magnific structure, 
the creation of the prince' own eccentr yet august taste. A strong 
and lofti wall girdl it in. thi wall had gate of iron. the 
courtiers, have entered, brought furnac and massi hammer and 
weld the bolts. they resolv to leav mean neither of ingress nor 
egress to the sudden impuls of despair or of frenzi from within. the 
abbey wa ampli provisioned. with such precaut the courtier might 
bid defianc to contagion. the extern world could take care of 
itself. In the meantim it wa folli to grieve, or to think. the 
princ had provid all the applianc of pleasure. there were 
buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there 
were musicians, there wa beauty, there wa wine. all these and 
secur were within. without wa the "red death". 

It wa toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of hi seclusion, 
and while the pestil rage most furious abroad, that the princ 
prospero entertain hi thousand friend at a mask ball of the most 
unusu magnificence. 

It wa a voluptu scene, that masquerade. but first let me tell of 
the room in which it wa held. these were seven--an imperi suite. 
In mani palaces, however, such suit form a long and straight vista, 
while the fold door slide back nearli to the wall on either hand, 
so that the view of the whole extent is scarc impeded. here the 
case wa veri different, as might have been expect from the duke' 
love of the _bizarre_. the apart were so irregularli dispos that 
the vision embrac but littl more than one at a time. there wa a 
sharp turn at everi twenti or thirti yards, and at each turn a novel 
effect. To the right and left, in the middl of each wall, a tall and 
narrow gothic window look out upon a close corridor which pursu 
the wind of the suite. these window were of stain glass whose 
colour vari in accord with the prevail hue of the decor 
of the chamber into which it opened. that at the eastern extrem wa 
hung, for exampl in blue--and vividli blue were it windows. the 
second chamber wa purpl in it ornament and tapestries, and here the 
pane were purple. the third wa green throughout, and so were the 
casements. the fourth wa furnish and light with orange--th fifth 
with white--th sixth with violet. the seventh apart wa close 
shroud in black velvet tapestri that hung all over the ceil and 
down the walls, fall in heavi fold upon a carpet of the same 
materi and hue. but in thi chamber only, the colour of the window 
fail to correspond with the decorations. the pane here were 
scarlet--a deep blood colour. now in no one of the seven apart 
wa there ani lamp or candelabrum, amid the profus of golden 
ornament that lay scatter to and fro or depend from the roof. 
there wa no light of ani kind eman from lamp or candl within the 
suit of chambers. but in the corridor that follow the suite, there 
stood, opposit to each window, a heavi tripod, bear a brazier of 
fire, that project it ray through the tint glass and so glaringli 
illumin the room. and thu were produc a multitud of gaudi and 
fantast appearances. but in the western or black chamber the effect 
of the fire-light that stream upon the dark hang through the 
blood-tint panes, wa ghastli in the extreme, and produc so wild a 
look upon the counten of those who entered, that there were few of 
the compani bold enough to set foot within it precinct at all. 

It wa in thi apartment, also, that there stood against the western 
wall, a gigant clock of ebony. it pendulum swung to and fro with a 
dull, heavy, monoton clang; and when the minute-hand made the 
circuit of the face, and the hour wa to be stricken, there came from 
the brazen lung of the clock a sound which wa clear and loud and deep 
and exceedingli musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasi that, 
at each laps of an hour, the musician of the orchestra were 
constrain to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to harken to 
the sound; and thu the waltzer perforc ceas their evolutions; and 
there wa a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the 
chime of the clock yet rang, it wa observ that the giddiest grew 
pale, and the more age and sedat pass their hand over their brow 
as if in confus reveri or meditation. but when the echo had fulli 
ceased, a light laughter at onc pervad the assembly; the musician 
look at each other and smile as if at their own nervous and 
folly, and made whisper vows, each to the other, that the next 
chime of the clock should produc in them no similar emotion; and 
then, after the laps of sixti minutes, (which embrac three thousand 
and six hundr second of the time that flies,) there came yet anoth 
chime of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and 
tremul and medit as before. 

but, in spite of these things, it wa a gay and magnific revel. the 
tast of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colour and 
effects. He disregard the _decora_ of mere fashion. hi plan were 
bold and fiery, and hi concept glow with barbar lustre. there 
are some who would have thought him mad. hi follow felt that he 
wa not. It wa necessari to hear and see and touch him to be _sure_ 
that he wa not. 

He had directed, in great part, the movabl embellish of the seven 
chambers, upon occas of thi great _fête_; and it wa hi own guid 
tast which had given charact to the masqueraders. Be sure they were 
grotesque. there were much glare and glitter and piquanc and 
phantasm--much of what ha been sinc seen in "hernani". there were 
arabesqu figur with unsuit limb and appointments. there were 
deliri fanci such as the madman fashions. there were much of the 
beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the _bizarre_, someth of the 
terrible, and not a littl of that which might have excit disgust. 
To and fro in the seven chamber there stalked, in fact, a multitud of 
dreams. and these--th dreams--writh in and about take hue from 
the rooms, and caus the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the 
echo of their steps. and, anon, there strike the eboni clock which 
stand in the hall of the velvet. and then, for a moment, all is 
still, and all is silent save the voic of the clock. the dream are 
stiff-frozen as they stand. but the echo of the chime die away--they 
have endur but an instant--and a light, half-subdu laughter float 
after them as they depart. and now again the music swells, and the 
dream live, and writh to and fro more merrili than ever, take hue 
from the mani tint window through which stream the ray from the 
tripods. but to the chamber which lie most westwardli of the seven, 
there are now none of the masker who venture; for the night is wane 
away; and there flow a ruddier light through the blood-colour panes; 
and the black of the sabl draperi appals; and to him whose foot 
fall upon the sabl carpet, there come from the near clock of eboni a 
muffl peal more solemnli emphat than ani which reach _their_ ear 
who indulg in the more remot gaieti of the other apartments. 

but these other apart were dens crowded, and in them beat 
feverishli the heart of life. and the revel went whirlingli on, until 
at length there commenc the sound of midnight upon the clock. and 
then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolut of the 
waltzer were quieted; and there wa an uneasi cessat of all thing 
as before. but now there were twelv stroke to be sound by the bell 
of the clock; and thu it happened, perhaps, that more of thought 
crept, with more of time, into the medit of the thought among 
those who revelled. and thu too, it happened, perhaps, that befor the 
last echo of the last chime had utterli sunk into silence, there were 
mani individu in the crowd who had found leisur to becom awar of 
the presenc of a mask figur which had arrest the attent of no 
singl individu before. and the rumour of thi new presenc have 
spread itself whisperingli around, there aros at length from the whole 
compani a buzz, or murmur, express of disapprob and 
surprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust. 

In an assembl of phantasm such as I have painted, it may well be 
suppos that no ordinari appear could have excit such sensation. 
In truth the masquerad licenc of the night wa nearli unlimited; but 
the figur in question had out-herod herod, and gone beyond the 
bound of even the prince' indefinit decorum. there are chord in the 
heart of the most reckless which cannot be touch without emotion. 
even with the utterli lost, to whom life and death are equal jests, 
there are matter of which no jest can be made. the whole company, 
indeed, seem now deepli to feel that in the costum and bear of 
the stranger neither wit nor proprieti existed. the figur wa tall 
and gaunt, and shroud from head to foot in the habili of the 
grave. the mask which conceal the visag wa made so nearli to 
resembl the counten of a stiffen corps that the closest 
scrutini must have had difficulti in detect the cheat. and yet all 
thi might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revel 
around. but the mummer had gone so far as to assum the type of the 
red death. hi vestur wa dabbl in _blood_--and hi broad brow, with 
all the featur of the face, wa besprinkl with the scarlet horror. 

when the eye of the princ prospero fell upon thi spectral imag 
(which, with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fulli to sustain 
it role, stalk to and fro among the waltzers) he wa seen to be 
convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror 
or distaste; but, in the next, hi brow redden with rage. 

"who dares,"--h demand hoars of the courtier who stood near 
him--"who dare insult us with thi blasphem mockery? seiz him and 
unmask him--that we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from the 
battlements!" 

It wa in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the princ 
prospero as he utter these words. they rang throughout the seven 
room loudli and clearly, for the princ wa a bold and robust man, and 
the music had becom hush at the wave of hi hand. 

It wa in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale 
courtier by hi side. At first, as he spoke, there wa a slight 
rush movement of thi group in the direct of the intruder, who at 
the moment wa also near at hand, and now, with deliber and state 
step, made closer approach to the speaker. but from a certain nameless 
awe with which the mad assumpt of the mummer had inspir the whole 
party, there were found none who put forth hand to seiz him; so that, 
unimpeded, he pass within a yard of the prince' person; and, while 
the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centr of 
the room to the walls, he made hi way uninterruptedly, but with the 
same solemn and measur step which had distinguish him from the 
first, through the blue chamber to the purple--through the purpl to 
the green--through the green to the orange--through thi again to the 
white--and even thenc to the violet, ere a decid movement had been 
made to arrest him. It wa then, however, that the princ prospero, 
madden with rage and the shame of hi own momentari cowardice, 
rush hurriedli through the six chambers, while none follow him on 
account of a deadli terror that had seiz upon all. He bore aloft a 
drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three 
or four feet of the retreat figure, when the latter, have attain 
the extrem of the velvet apartment, turn suddenli and confront 
hi pursuer. there wa a sharp cry--and the dagger drop gleam 
upon the sabl carpet, upon which, instantli afterwards, fell prostrat 
in death the princ prospero. then, summon the wild courag of 
despair, a throng of the revel at onc threw themselv into the 
black apartment, and, seiz the mummer, whose tall figur stood erect 
and motionless within the shadow of the eboni clock, gasp in 
unutter horror at find the grave cerement and corpse-lik mask, 
which they handl with so violent a rudeness, unten by ani 
tangibl form. 

and now wa acknowledg the presenc of the red death. He had come 
like a thief in the night. and one by one drop the revel in the 
blood-bedew hall of their revel, and die each in the despair 
postur of hi fall. and the life of the eboni clock went out with 
that of the last of the gay. and the flame of the tripod expired. 
and dark and decay and the red death held illimit dominion over 
all.
