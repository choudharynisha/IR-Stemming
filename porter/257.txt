the medici boot 


By pearl norton swet 


_the amethyst-cov boot had been worn by an evil wanton 
in mediev florence--but what malef power did they carri 
over into our own time?_ 

* * * * * 



prefac 
for fifti year they lay under glass in the dickerson museum and they 
were label "the medici boots." they were fashion of creami 
leather, pliabl as a young girl' hands. they were thread with 
silver, appliqu with sapphir silk and scarlet, and set on the tip 
of each wa a pale and love amethyst. such were the medici boots. 

old sila dickerson, globe-trott and collector, had brought the 
boot from a dusti shop in florenc when he wa a young man fill 
with the lust for travel and adventure. the year pass and sila 
dickerson wa an old man, hi hair white, hi eye dim, hi vein 
hand trembl with the agu that preced death. 

when he wa nineti and the year of hi wander over, sila 
dickerson die one morn as he sat in a high-back venetian chair 
in hi privat museum. the fourteenth centuri gold-leaf paintings, the 
japanes procession banners, the stolen bone of a normandi 
saint--al the belov trophi of hi travel must have watch the 
dead man impass for hour befor hi housekeep found him. 

the old man sat with hi head thrown back against the fade tapestri 
of the venetian chair, hi eye closed, hi boni arm extend along 
the beauti carv arm of the chair, and on hi lap lay the 
medici boots. 

It wa high noon when they found him, and the sun wa stream 
through the stained-glass window abov the chair and pick at the 
amethysts, so that the violet stone seem to eye marthe, the old 
housekeeper, with an impud glitter. marth mutter a prayer and 
cross herself, befor she ran like a scare rabbit with the news of 
the master' death. 

[illustration: "she impart to me those terribl secret of the black 
art which were deep in her soul."] 

sila dickerson' onli surviv relatives, the three young 
delameters, did not take too serious the note which wa found among 
the paper in the museum' desk. old sila had written the note. It 
wa address to john delameter, for john wa hi uncle' favorite, 
but john' pretti wife, suzanne, and hi twin brother, doctor eric, 
read it over hi shoulder; and they all smile tolerantly. old 
dickerson had written of thing incomprehens to the young moderns: 

"the content of my privat museum are yours, john, to do with as you 
see fit. mere as a suggestion, I would say that the antiquarian 
societi would snap up mani of the things. A veri few are of no 
particular value, except to me. one thing I want done, however. the 
medici boot of ivori leather must either be destroy or be put for 
ever under glass in a _public_ museum. I prefer that they be 
destroyed, for they are a danger possession. they have gone to the 
adulter rendezv celebr in the scandal vers of lorenzo 
the magnificent. they have shod the feet of a murderess. they were 
curs by the church as trap of the devil, incit the wearer to 
foul deed and intrigue. 

"I shall not disturb you with all their hideou history, but I repeat, 
they are a danger possession. I have taken care to keep them under 
lock and key, behind plate glass, for more than fifti years. I have 
never taken them out. destroy the medici boots, befor they destroy 
you!" 

"but he did take them out!" cri suzanne. "uncl wa hold the 
boot when--when marth found him there in the museum." 

john reread the note, and look thought at hi young wife. "yes. 
perhap he wa prepar to destroy them right then. Of course, I 
think the poor old fellow took thing a bit too seriously--h wa veri 
old, you know, and marth say he practic live in thi museum of 
his." 

"and whi call a pair of old boot dangerous? Of course, we all know 
the medici were plenti dangerous, but the medici boots--that' 
ridiculous, john. besides----" 

suzann paus provocatively, her red lip pouting. she look down at 
her trimli shod feet. "besides, i'd like to tri on those medici 
boots--just once. they'r lovely, I think." 

john wa frown thoughtfully. He scarc heard her suggestion. He 
spoke to eric, instead, and hi voic seem a bit troubled. 

"I believ that uncl _was_ get readi to destroy those boot that 
veri morn he died; els whi should he have taken them from their 
case--aft fifti years?" 

"yes, I believ you'r right, john, becaus that note is date fulli a 
month befor uncle' death. I think he brood over leav those 
boot to one he care for. poor old man!" 

"I wouldn't call him so, eric. He had hi dream of adventur realiz 
more fulli than most men. i--i think i'll do as he says. i'll destroy 
the medici boots." 

"if you'd feel better about it," assent hi brother. but suzann did 
not speak. she wa look at her shoe, purs her lip thoughtfully, 
see her feet encas in the gay embroideri of the medici boots. 

john seem reliev by hi decision. "yes, i'd better do it. we'll be 
get back to town in a few days. old erskine, you know, uncle' 
lawyer, is come down thi afternoon. then soon we'll be on the wing, 
susi and i--vienna, paris, the alps--thank to uncle." 

"mayb you think i'm not thank for my chanc at a bit more work at 
john hopkins," said eric, and they did not again speak of the medici 
boots. 

* * * * * 

the deaf old lawyer of the dickerson estat arrived, and suzanne, with 
the easi capabl that wa part of her charm, saw that he wa made 
comfortable. 

At seven there wa a perfect dinner serv on the awning terrac 
outsid the softli lit living-room. the star aid the two littl 
rosi lamp on the table, and sway willow besid a stone-encircl 
pool swung the incens of the garden about them. 

As dinner ended, john took from the pocket of hi coat a small, 
limp-leath book. He push back hi dessert plate and laid the book 
on the table, tap it with a finger as he spoke. 

"thi is the histori of the medici boots. It wa in the littl 
wall-saf in the museum. after all uncl said of the medici boots, 
shall we read it?" and turn to the old lawyer, he told of sila 
dickerson' letter concern the boots. 

erskin shook hi head, smiling. "most collector get an exagger 
sens of the supernatural. read this, by all means--it should prove 
interesting." 

"yes, read it, john." suzann and eric spoke almost together. 

so, in the circl of rosi light at their littl table, john read the 
stori of the medici boots. It wa not a long stori and it wa told in 
the languag of an anonym translator, but as john read on, hi 
listen were drawn together, as by a spell. they scarc breathed, 
and the summer night that wa so mildli beauti seem to take on a 
sens of hover danger. 

"in the palac of giuliano de' medici I have live long. I am 
an old woman now, as the year are reckon in thi infam 
place, though I am but fifti and three. 

"separ from my betrothed, duped, sold into the marbl 
labyrinth of thi hate palace, it wa long befor my 
spirit broke and I went forth, bejewel and attir in 
elegance, among the silk-clad florentines. I wa label the 
most beauti mistress of ani of the medici. I wa smirk 
at, fawn upon for my lord' favors, obscen jest about 
in the orgi that took place in the great banquet hall of 
the palace. 

"but in my heart alway lay the remembr of my lost love, 
and in my soul grew black hatr for the medici and all their 
kind. I, who had dream onli of a modest home, a kind 
husband, black-haired, trust littl children, wa made a 
tool of the medici infamy. 

"in time, I almost felt myself in leagu with the devil. 
secretly, and with a grow sens of elation, I made 
frequent rendezv with a foul hag whose veri name wa 
anathema to the churchli folk of florence. In her hole of a 
room in a certain noisom street, she impart to me those 
terribl secret of the black art which were deep in her 
soul. It wa amus that she wa paid in medici gold. 

"the corrupt of the medici bred in them fear; in me a sort 
of reckless bravery. It wa I who poison the wine of mani a 
foe of the medici. It wa I who put the point of a dagger in 
the heart of the old princ de vittorio, whose land and 
power and palac were covet by my lord, giuliano. 

"after a time, bloodsh becam an exhilar to me; the 
death agoni of those who drank the poison cup becam more 
interest than the flatteri of the medici followers. even 
the ladi of the hous of the medici did me the honor of 
their subtli barb friendliness. 

"through thi veri friendliness, I conceiv my plan of sweet 
reveng upon the monster who had ruin my life. with so 
great a hatr boil in my soul that my mind reeled, my 
sens throbbed, my heart rose in my throat like a spurt of 
flame, I curs three thing of exquisit beauti with all the 
fervor of my newli learn lesson in devilish lore. 

"these three beauti object I present to three ladi of 
the hous of medici--pres them with honey word of 
mock humility. A necklac of jewel links--i pledg myself 
to the devil and will that the golden necklac would 
tighten on the soft throat of a ladi of the medici while she 
slept, and strangl her into black death. A bracelet of 
filigre and sapphires--to pierc by it hidden silver needl 
the blue vein in a white medici wrist, so that her life' 
blood would spurt and she would know the terror that the 
hous of the medici gave to others. 

"last, and most ingenious, a pair of creami boots, pliable, 
embroid in silver and silks, encrust with amethysts--mi 
betroth jewels. In my hatr I curs the boots, will 
that the wearer, as long as a shred of the boot remained, 
should kill as I had killed, poison as I had poisoned, leav 
all thought of home and husband and live in wanton and 
evil. So I curs the beauti boots, forgetting, in my 
hate, that perhap anoth than a medici might, in the year 
to come, wear them and becom the devil' pawn, even as I am 
now. 

"in my life, the medici will have the boots, of that I feel 
sure; but after that--i can onli hope that thi bloodi 
histori of the boot may be found when I am no more, and may 
it be a warning. 

"I have live to see my gift receiv and worn, and I have 
laugh in my soul to see my curs bring death and terror 
and evil to three medici women. I know not what will becom 
of the golden necklace, the bracelet, or the boots. the boot 
may be lost or stolen, or they may lie in a medici palac for 
age on age, but the curs will cling to them till they are 
destroyed. So I pray that no woman, save a medici, will ever 
wear them. 

"a I live and breath and do the bid of the lord of 
florence, the accurs medici--i have told the truth. when I 
am dead, perhap they will find thi book, and, in hell, I 
shall know and be glad. 

"maria modena DI cavouri. 

"florence, 1476." 

* * * * * 

"whew!" said old erskine. 

john laughed. "I don't suppos thi charm histori would have been 
ani more thrill if I had read it from the origin book, in 
italian, of course. wonder where uncl got it! there wa no mention of 
it be in the library--but there it was." 

"now, will you destroy those boots?" ask eric, and he wa not 
entir in jest. 

but suzann said, laughingly, "not befor I find out if the medici 
ladi had a smaller foot than I! are they still in the museum, john?" 

"never you mind, my dear. they'r not for the like of you." 

"oh, don't be silly, john. thi is 1935, not the fifteenth century." 
and they laugh at suzanne' earnestness. 

the book that held the stori of the medici boot lay on the white 
cloth, look like a book of love verse. 

suzanne, a small white blur against the summer dark, sat quietli while 
the men talk of sila dickerson, hi life, hi mania for collecting, 
hi death that had so fittingli come to him in hi museum. It wa 
nearli twelv when suzann left the men on the terrac and with a 
quiet "good-night" enter the living-room and cross to the long, 
shine stairs. 

the men went on with their talk. once, john, look toward the 
jut wing that wa the museum, exclaimed, "look at that, will you? 
why--i'd swear I saw a light in the museum." 

"you lock it, didn't you?" ask eric. 

"of course; the key' in my desk upstairs. h-m. i'm probabl mistaken, 
but it did seem as though a light shone there just a moment ago." 

"reflect from the living-room window, I think. countri life is 
make you jittery, john." and eric laugh at hi brother. 

the men sat on, reluct to leav the beauti of the night, and it wa 
almost two o'clock when they final went inside. 

john said, "I think i'll not disturb suzanne." and he went to sleep in 
a wide four-post bed in a room next to hi wife. eric and the old 
lawyer were in room across the hall. 

* * * * * 

the still summer night close about the hous of sila dickerson, and 
when the moon lay die against the bank of cloud, puf across a sky 
by the littl wind that came befor dawn, young doctor eric delamet 
awoke, suddenli and completely, to a feel of clammi apprehension. 
He had not lock hi door, and now, across the gray of the room, 
he saw it slowli opening. 

A hand wa close around the edg of the door--a woman' hand, small 
and white and jeweled. eric sat straight and tens on the edg of hi 
bed, peer across the room. A woman, young and slender, in a long, 
trail gown, came toward him smiling. It wa suzanne. 

with a gasp, eric watch her approach till she stood directli befor 
him. 

"suzanne! you are asleep? suzanne, shall I call john?" 

He thought that perhap he should not waken her; there were thing one 
must rememb about sleep-walkers, but physician scarc believ 
them. 

eric wa puzzled, too, by her costume. It wa not a night-rob she 
wore, but an elaborate, trail dress upon which embroideri in 
silver shone faintly. her short black curl were bound about three 
time with strand of pearli beads, her slim white arm were load 
with bracelets. the point toe of littl shoe peep beneath her 
gown, littl shoe of creami leather. An amethyst gleam on each 
shoe. 

the sight of these amethystin tip affect eric strangely, much as 
though he had look at someth hideous repulsive. He stood up and 
put out a hand to touch suzanne' arm. 

"suzanne," he said, gently. "let me take you to john. shall i?" 

suzann look up at him, and her brown eyes, usual so merry, were 
deepli slumberous, not with sleep, but with a look of utter abandon. 
she shook her pearl-bound head slowly, smilingly. 

"no, not john. I want you, eric." 

"mad! suzann must be mad!" wa eric' quick thought, but her caress 
wa swifter than hi thought. both jewel-laden arm about hi neck, 
suzann kiss him, her red lip pout warmli upon his. 

"suzanne! you don't know what you'r doing." He grasp both her hand 
in hi and with a hast that would have seem ludicr to him had he 
view the scene in a picture-play, he hurri her out of hi room and 
across the hall. 

eric open her door softli and with no gentl hand shove suzann 
insid her room. she seem like a littl anim in hi grasp. she 
hiss at him; claw and scratch at hi hand. but when he had shut 
the door, she did not open it again, and after a moment he went back 
to hi own room. 

* * * * * 

hi mouth set in a firm line, hi heart beat fast, eric lock hi 
door with a noiseless turn of the key. It wa almost dawn, and the 
garden lay like a rare pastel outsid hi window; but eric saw none of 
it. He scarc thought, though hi lip moved, as if chaotic word 
were struggl for utterance. 

He look down at hi hand, where two long red scratch ooz a 
trickl of blood. after he had wash hi hand, he lay down on hi bed 
and cover hi eye with hi arm, against the pictur of suzanne. 
abov all els there stood out the gleam tip of her littl shoes, 
as he had glimps them through the dim light of hi room when she 
came toward him. 

"she wore the medici boots! the medici boots! suzann must have taken 
them from the museum!" over and over he said it--"th medici boots! 
the medici boots!" 

eric rather dread breakfast, but when he came down at eight, to the 
terrac where a rustic tabl wa set invitingly, he found john and the 
lawyer await him. john greet hi brother affectionately. 

"morning, old boy! hope you slept well. whi so solemn? feel seedy?" 

"no, no. I am perfectli all right," eric repli hastily, reliev 
that suzann wa not present. He ad with a scarc notic 
hesitation, "suzann not come down?" 

"no," repli john, easily. "she seem to want to sleep awhile. sent 
her regrets. she'll see us at lunch." 

john went on. "I certainli had a nightmar last night. thought a woman 
in a long, shine dress came into my room and tri to stab me. thi 
morn I found that a glass on my bed-tabl wa overturn and 
broken, and, by george, i'd cut my wrist on it." 

He show a jag cut on hi wrist. "take a look, doctor eric." 

eric look at the cut, carefully. "not bad, but you might have bled 
to death, had it been a quarter of an inch to the left. If you like, 
i'll fix it up a bit for you after breakfast." 

eric' voic wa calm enough, but hi puls wa pounding, hi heart 
sick. all morn he rode through the countrysid adjoin the 
dickerson estate, but he let the mare go as she like and where she 
liked, for hi mind wa busi with the event of the hour befor dawn. 
He knew that the slash on hi brother' wrist wa made by steel, not 
glass. yet when the ride wa over, he could not bring himself to tell 
john of suzanne' visit. 

"she must have been sleep-walking, though I can't account for the way 
she wa deck out. i'v alway thought suzann extrem modest in 
her dress, certainli not inclin to load herself with jewelry. and 
those boots! john must get them today and destroy them, as he said. 
silly, perhaps, but----" hi thought went on and on, alway return 
to the medici boots, in spite of himself. 

* * * * * 

eric came back from hi ride at eleven o'clock, with as troubl a 
mind as when he began it. He almost fear to see suzann at lunch. 

when he did meet her with john and mr. erskin on the cool, shade 
porch where they lunched, he saw there wa noth to fear. the 
amorous, cling woman of the hour befor dawn wa not there at all. 
there wa onli the suzann whom eric knew and love as a sister. 

here, again, wa their merri littl suzanne, somewhat spoil by her 
husband, it is true, but a suzann sweetli feminine, almost childish 
in a crisp, white frock and little, low-heel sandals. their talk wa 
lazili pleasant--of tenni honor and horses, of the prize delphinium 
in the garden, of the tini maltes kitten which suzann had brought up 
from the stabl late that morn and instal in a pink-bow 
basket on the porch. she show the kitten to eric, handl it tini 
paw gently, hush it plaintiv mew with ridicul pet names. 

"perhap i'm a bigger fool than I know. perhap it never happened, 
except in a dream," eric told himself, unhappily. "and yet----" 

He look at the red mark on hi hand, mark made by a furiou 
suzann in that hour befor the dawn. too, he rememb the cut on 
john' wrist, the cut so near the vein. 

eric declin john' invit to go through the museum with him that 
afternoon, but he said with a queer sens of diffidence, "while 
you'r there, john, you'd better get rid of the medici boots. creepi 
thing to have around, I think." 

"they'll be destroyed, all right. but suzann is just bound to tri 
them on. i'll get them, though, and do as uncl said." 

eric remain on the terrace, specul somewhat on just what john 
and suzann would do, now that the huge fortun of sila dickerson wa 
theirs. eric wa not enviou of hi brother' good luck, and he wa 
thank for hi share in old silas' generosity. 

At five o'clock he enter the hall, just as suzann hurri in from 
the kitchen. she spread our her hands, laughingly. 

"with my own fair hand i'v made individu almond tortoni for 
dessert. cook think i'm a wonder! each masterpiec in a flute silver 
dish, silver candi sprinkl on the pink whip cream! o-oh!" 

she made big eye in mock gluttony. eric forgot, for a moment, that 
there ever had been anoth suzanne. 

"you'r noth but a littl girl, suzie. you with your rhapsodi 
over pink whip cream! but it' sweet of you to go to such troubl 
on a warm afternoon. see you and the whatever-you-call-'em at 
dinner!" 

"they'r tortonis, eric, tortonis." 

suzann ran lightli up the stairs. eric follow more slowly. He 
enter hi room think that there were some thing which must be 
explain in thi hous with the old museum. 

* * * * * 

twenti minut befor dinner eric and john were on the terrac wait 
for suzanne. john wa talkative, which wa just as well, as he might 
have wonder at hi brother' silence. eric wa torn between a desir 
to tell hi brother hi reluct suspicion concern the medici 
boot and suzann and hi inclin to leav thing alon till the 
boot could be destroyed. 

He said, diffidently, "john, ha suzann those--thos boots?" 

john chuckled. "why, yes. I saw them in her room. Do you know she went 
down to the museum last night and took those boots? It _was_ a light I 
saw in the museum. It wa her light. suzann ha ideas. want to wear 
the boot just once, she says, to lay the ghost of thi 
what's-her-name--maria modena. suzann say she couldn't sleep much 
last night. got up earli and tri on those boots. well, I think i'll 
destroy 'em tomorrow. uncle' wish, so i'll do it." 

"tri them on, did she? well, if you should ask me, i'd say that 
histori of the boot wa a bit too excit for suzanne. It _was_ a 
haunt story. uncl must have swallow it, hook, line, and sinker, 
eh?" 

"of course. hi letter show that. but suzann live in the present, 
not the past, as uncl did. I suppos suzann will wear those boots, 
or she won't feel satisfied. I don't exactli like the idea, I must 
confess." 

someth like an electr shock pass through eric. He said, 
somewhat breathlessly, "I don't think suzann ought to have the medici 
boots." 

john look at him curious and laughed. "I never knew you were 
superstitious, eric. but do you realli think----" 

"I don't know what I think, john. but if she were my wife, i'd take 
those boot away from her. uncl may have known what he wa talk 
about." 

"well, I think she' intend to wear them at dinner, so prepar to 
be dazzled. here she is, now. greetings, sweet-heart!" 

suzann swept across the terrace, her gown goldli shimmering, pearl 
bound about her head, as eric had seen her in the dim hour befor 
dawn. again the row of bracelet were weight her slim arms. and 
she wore the medici boots, the amethyst tip peep beneath her 
shine dress. 

john, ever readi for gay clowning, aros and bow low. "hail, 
empress! a-ah, the dress you got in florenc on our honeymoon, isn't 
it? and those darn medici boots!" 

suzann unsmilingli extend her hand for him to kiss. 

john arch an eyebrow, comically. "what' the matter, honey? go 
regal on me?" and retain her hand, he kiss each of her fingers. 

suzann snatch away her hand, and the glanc she gave her husband 
wa one of venom hauteur. To eric she turn a look that wa an 
open caress, lean toward him, put a hand on hi arm, as he 
stood besid hi chair, stern-lipped, with eye that would not look at 
john' hurt bewilderment. 

the three sat down then, in the low wicker chairs, and wait for 
dinner--thre peopl with oddli differ emotions. john wa hurt, 
slightli impati with hi bride; eric wa furiou with suzanne, 
though there wa in hi heart the almost certain knowledg that the 
suzann besid them on the terrac wa not the suzann they knew, but 
a cruelli strang woman, the product of a sinist force, unknown and 
compelling. 

No one, look on suzanne' red-lip and heavy-lid beauty, could 
miss the knowledg that here wa a woman danger subtle, carri 
a power more devast than the dart lightn that now and then 
show itself over the tree-top of the garden. eric began to feel 
someth of this, and there shape in hi mind a wariness, a defens 
against thi woman who wa not suzanne. 

"no _al fresco_ dine tonight," said john, as the darken sky wa 
vein by a sudden spray of blue-green light. "rain on the way. pretti 
good storm, i'd say." 

"I like it," repli suzanne, draw in a deep breath of the sultri 
air. 

john laughed. "sinc when, sweet-heart? you usual shake and shiver 
through a thunderstorm." 

suzann ignor him. she smile at eric and said in a low tone, "and 
if I should lose my bravery, you would take care of me, wouldn't you, 
eric?" 

befor eric could reply, dinner wa announced, and he felt a relief 
and also a dread. thi dinner wa go to be difficult. 

john offer hi arm to hi wife, smile at her, hope for a smile 
in return, but suzann shrug and said in a caress voice, "eric?" 

* * * * * 

eric could onli bow stiffli and offer hi arm, while john walk 
slowli besid them, hi face thoughtful, hi gay spirit gone. dure 
dinner, however, he tri to reviv the lag conversation. suzann 
spoke in a staccato voic and her choic of word seem strang to 
eric, almost as though she were translat her own thought from a 
foreign tongue. 

and final suzanne' promis dessert came, cool and tempt in it 
silver dishes. eric saw a chanc to make the talk more natural. He 
said, gayly, "johnny, your wife' a chef, a famou pastri chef. behold 
the work of her hands! what did you say it was, suzanne?" 

"this? oh--i do not know what it is called." 

"but thi afternoon as you were leav the kitchen--didn't you say it 
wa almond someth or other?" 

she shook her head, smiling. "perhap it is. I wouldn't know." 

the maid had place the tray with the three silver dish of dessert 
befor suzanne, that she might put on them the final sprinkl of 
delic silver candies. daintily, suzann sift the shine bubbl 
over the fluff of cream. eric, watch her, felt veri littl surpriz 
when he saw suzanne, with almost legerdemain deftness, sift upon one 
dish a film of pinkish powder which could not be detect after it lay 
on the pink cream. 

waiting, he knew not for what moment, he watch suzann pass the 
silver dish herself, saw her offer the one with the powder top to 
john. and it wa then that their attent wa attract by the 
entranc of the maltes kitten. So tini it was, so brave in it 
careen totter across the shini floor, small tail hoist like a 
sail, that john and eric laugh aloud. 

suzann mere glanc down at the littl creatur and turn away. 
the kitten, however, came to her chair, put up a tini paw and caught 
it curv claw in the fragil stuff of suzanne' gown. instantly, 
her face becam distort with rage and she kick out at the kitten, 
savagely, and with set lips. It seem to eric that the amethyst on 
the medici boot wink wickedli in the light of the big chandelier. 

the kitten wa flung some ten feet away, and lay in a small, pant 
heap. 

john sprang up. "suzanne! how could you?" He took the kitten in hi 
arm and sooth it. 

"whi it heart' beat like a trip-hammer," he said. "I don't 
understand, suzanne----" 

As the kitten grew quiet, he took a larg rose-leaf from the 
table-flow and spread it with a heap spoon of the pink cream 
from hi dessert. then he put the kitten on the floor besid it. 

"here, littl one. lick thi up. it' fanci eating. suzanne' sorry. I 
know she is." 

the kitten, with the greed of it kind, devour the cream, cover 
it small nose and whisker with a pinkish film. suzann sat back in 
her chair, finger her bracelets, her eye on eric' face. john 
watch the kitten, and eric watched, too--watch tensely, for he 
sens what would happen to it. 

the kitten finish the cream, lick it paw and whisker and turn 
to walk away. then it spun around in a frantic convulsion, and in a 
moment lay dead on it back, it tini fed tongu protruding, it paw 
rigid. 

outside, the storm glowered, and in the chartreus light of the fork 
lightning, the great chandeli wa turn to a sickli radiance. 
thunder roll like muffl drums. 

suddenli suzann began to laugh, peal after peal of terribl laughter, 
and then, after a glare of lightning, the big chandeli wink out. 
the room wa plung into stormi darkness, and they could hear the 
rain lash through the garden to hurl itself against the windows. 

"don't be frightened, suzanne." It wa john' solicit voice, and it 
wa follow by a quick movement from suzanne' side of the table. 

A sheet of blue-green light illumin the room for an instant, and 
eric saw suzann struggl in her husband' arms, one jewel arm 
uplift and in her hand a shine dagger. 

* * * * * 

with a bound that wa almost involuntary, eric reach them and struck 
at the knife in suzanne' hand. It clatter to the floor. and as 
though the furi of the storm and suzanne' mad both were spent, 
the slash rain and the lightn stop abruptly, and suzann 
ceas to struggle. 

"light the candles, eric--quickly--on the mantel to your right! 
suzann is hurt!" 

In the candle-light, pale golden and swaying, eric saw suzann 
slump limpli in john' arms. the hem of her golden dress wa redli 
wet and one cream-color littl shoe wa fast becom soak with 
blood from a slash across the instep. 

"let' get her over to the window-seat, eric. Do someth for 
her!--oh, sweet-heart, don't moan like that!" there wa no question or 
reproach in john' voice, onli compassion. 

eric took off hi coat, roll up hi sleeves. hi mouth wa grimli 
set, hi hand steady, hi voic crispli professional. "take off those 
shoes, john. she'll--b herself, then. I mean that she'll be 
suzanne--not a murderess of the medicis. take them off, john! they'r 
at the bottom of this." 

"you mean----" john' voic wa breathless, hi lip trembling. 

"I mean those hellish boot have chang suzann from a sweet and 
love girl to--well, do as I tell you. i'll be back with gauz and 
some thing I need." 

when eric hurri back, there were three servant group at the 
dining-room door. He spoke to them bruskli and they left, wide-ey 
and whispering. eric close the door. 

while the wet leav tap against the window and star struggl 
through the clouds, eric worked, silently, expertly, grimly, by the 
light of a flashlight held in john' unsteadi hand and the light of 
the flicker candles. the hous light were all snuf out by the 
storm. 

"there," eric gave a satisfi grunt. the brother stood look at 
suzanne, who seem asleep. her golden dress glimmer in the 
candle-light and the pearl were slip from her dark hair. the 
medici boot lay in a limp and bloodi heap in a corner, where eric had 
flung them. 

"when she awakes, I shouldn't tell her about ani of this, if I were 
you, john." 

"there are thing you haven't told me, eric, aren't there? thing 
about--th medici boots?" 

eric look steadili at hi brother. "yes, old fellow; and after i'v told 
you, those boot must be destroyed. we'll burn them befor thi night is 
over. We mustn't move her now. we'll go out on the terrace--it' wet 
there, but the air is fresh. did you smell--someth peculiar?" 

for, as they pass the corner where the medici boot lay slash and 
bloody, eric could have sworn that there came to him a horrid odor, 
fetid, hotli offensive--th odor of iniqu and ancient bloodi death.
