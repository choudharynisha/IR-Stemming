summary.-astrology, as present practic (in either it tradiuon or psycho- 
logic form), ha no relev to understand ourselv or our place in the cosmos. 
modern advoc of astrolog cannot account for the underli basi of astrolog 
associ with terrestri affairs, have no plausibl explan for it claims, and 
have not contribut anyth of cognit valu to ani field of the social sciences. 
further, astrolog doe not have the theoret or conceptu resourc to resolv it 
own intern problem adequ or extern anomali or to adjud among con- 
flict astrolog claim or systems. 

the initi assumpt of scientist and astrolog were not so veri differ until quit re- 
cently. some astrologers, however, fear that scienc wa catch up to them, have back- 
track veri rapidly, c r e a h g a smokescreen of symbolism, inner reality, holist understanding, 
etc. 
arthur mather (1979, p. 106) 

In western cultur until newton the view of astrolog and scientist 
were not so veri different. there wa gener belief that -all phenomena in 
the inferior element world of natur were govern in some way by the 
motion of the superior and incorrupt celesti bodies. sinc newton, 
however, the view of astrolog and scientist have becom increasingli 
opposed. astrolog today stdl hold that the connect between celesti 
and earthli phenomena is so strong that know one allow us to predict 
the other. but scientist disagree. they point out that there is no plausibl 
way the connect could work, or even a plausibl theori of how it could 
work. survey of research into astrolog have provid no evid that 
astrolog doe work, at least not in the way and to the extent claim by 
astrologers. Of course, everi time we wake up with the sun, or plan barbe- 
cue on m o o d t nights, or go fish at high tide, we are show how celes- 
tial bodi have real influenc in our lives; but thi IS veri differ from the 
connect clame by astrologers. go from one co the other is a quit 
unjusufi leap of faith.

ogi today do not even attempt to defend it but simpli teach their reader 
how to use it" (p. 39). similarly, nia and dean (1986) point out, "no- 
bodi should be surpris to learn that the hardest thing to find in astrolog 
are facts" (p. 357). but if you know where to look they can certainli be 
found. 
befor 1950 veri few scientif studi of astrolog existed. someth 
h e a dozen major statist compil by astrolog had appear sinc 
1900, notabl in france, germany, england and the usa, but none were 
wide known, and in ani case their methodolog wa too poor, e.g., no 
controls, for meaning results. not surprisingly, the few publish critiqu 
were confin mostli to histor survey (e.g., thomen, 1938; bok & 
mayall, 1941; eisler, 1946). the onli extens scientif critiqu avail 
wa by the french astronom paul couderc (1951/1974). then in 1955 
michel G a u q u e h publish hi landmark l'lnfluenc de astres, the first 
rigor studi of astrolog claims, with gener neg result but with 
what seem to be provoc except (gauqueh, 1955). 
dure the next two decad variou factor combin to establish a 
small but continu interest in astrolog research, namely, the boom 
popular interest in astrology, further work by gauquelin (e.g., 1966, 1969), 
the occasion astrology-rel paper in a scientif journal, and not least by 
astrolog themselv found research-ori bodl such as the astro- 
logic associ (uk) in 1958 and the intern societi for astrologi- 
cal research (usa) in 1970. the result wa a notabl increas in the number 
of critic studies. 
Ln the 1970 there appear variou critiqu of the occult that in- 
clude astrolog (e.g., freedland, 1972; cooper, 1974; sladek, 1974; cazeau 
& scott, 1979) and critiqu devot entir to astrolog (e.g., parker, 1970; 
russell, 1972; gallant, 1974; dean & mather, 1977; jerome, 1977; standen, 
1977; kelly, 1979). the last wa the first comprehens critic review of as- 
trology' scientif research base. It took seven person-year to prepare, sur- 
vey mani hundr of book and articles, and document over 150 em- 
piric stucb publish in astrolog journal and over twenti publish in 
psycholog journal (dean & mather, 1977). By 1996, new studl and pre- 
viousli miss studi had brought these total to about 300 and 70, respec- 
tive (dean, nias, & french, 1997). 
the research interest that dean and mather (1977) stimul led to 
the foundat in 1981 of correlation, an intern peer-review journal 
devot entir to scientif research into astrology, follow in 1982 by 
astro-psycholog problems, orient more toward gauquelin interests. By 
then the advent of home comput in the late 1970 had revolution 
astrolog practic and research. calcul a birth chart onc took any-

research to do studi that were previous unthinkable. today there is a 
scholarli research base that cover most of the basic claim of astrology. 
even sun slgn column have been tested. the outcom from all this, in what 
probabl amount to well over two hundr person-year of research, is al- 
most uniformli neg (dean, mather, & kelly, 1996). unfortunately, much 
of thi work is neither wide known nor easili accessible, a point to which I 
will return shortly. 
critic review of astrolog in the light of research findings, post-1980, 
includ those by psychologist eysenck and nia (1982), astronom culver 
and ianna (1988), crow (1990), marten and trachet (1995), and the bibl 
scholars, ankerberg and weldon (1989). the most recent review and the 
first to includ meta-analys are by kelly, dean, and saklofsk (1990) and 
dean, mather, and kelli (1996). critiqu of philosophical, rehgiou or so- 
cial aspect of astrolog includ kelli and krutzen (19831, leahey and 
leahey (1983), kanitscheid (1991), dean (1992), and dean and loptson 
(1996). review of the argument of astrolog includ kelly, culver, and 
loptson (1989), and dean, mather, and kelli (1996). theori of astrolog 
(includ jung' synchronicity) are critic examin in dean, loptson, 
and kelli (1996). descript of the gauquelin work includ gauquelin 
(1983, 1988) and ertel (1992). the 'mar effect' is specif address by 
benski, caudron. gahfret, krivine, pecker, rouze, and schatzman (19961, 
whose conclus have been dspute by ertel and inlmg (1996). the cog- 
nitiv and perceptu bias that can underli belief in astrolog are briefli 
review by dean (1992) and in detail by dean, kelly, saklofske, and furn- 
ham (1992), and dean, mather, and kelli (1996). recent critiqu of the 
occult that cover astrolog includ coutti (19881, hme (19881, and neher 
(1990). there is, of course, an extens and ongo literatur on the his- 
tori of astrology, for example, ancient astrolog (baigent, 1994; barton, 
1994; stewart, 1996), mediev psycholog (kemp, 19901, pre- 19' centuri 
astrolog (tester, 1987), and 19' centuri astrolog (curry, 1992). 
whi the present article? sinc the mid-1970 psycholog journal have 
averag a steadi total per year of about two empir studi of astrologi- 
cal claims, plu an equal number devot to relat topic such as the accep- 
tanc of astrolog statement or the preval of belief in astrology, all of 
them easili access via psyclit, the american psycholog association' 
computer abstract database. but for everi such empir studi there are 
at least four more of equal qu&ti in journal not access via psyclit. 
fortunately, most of the major review list abov cover thi wider informa- 
tion base. On the other hand, the review are gener more focuss on 
empir findtng than with paradigm and conceptu arguments. the pres- 
ent articl focus on the latter and bring togeth previous scatter ma- 
terial.
