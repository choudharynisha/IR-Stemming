prefac 
It all start with a dutchman, a pennsylvania dutchman name peter 
scheinberger, who till a weather beaten farm back in the hills. 

A strong, wiri man he was--hi arm were knot section of solid 
hickori form themselv into gnarl hand and twist stub of 
fingers. hi furrow brow, dri by the sun and crack in a million 
place by the wind wa well irrig by long rivulet of sweat. when he 
went forth in the field behind hi hors and plow, it wasn't long 
befor hi hair wa plaster down firmli to hi scalp. the salti water 
pour out of the deep ring in hi ruddi neck and ran down hi dark 
brown back. As he grew older the skin peel and grew loose. It hung on 
him in fold like the brittl hide of a rhino. 

It seem that the more year he spent in hi field behind the plow 
horse, the more he slip back into the timeless tradit of hi 
forefathers. He wa a proud descend of a long line of staunch german 
settler commonli known as the pennsylvania dutch. He grew up in hi 
fundamental, religi sect have never known ani other environment. He 
wa expos to the sun, soil, and wind from the earli day of hi 
childhood, and along with the element he also wa expos to the evil 
of the _hexerei_. the _hexerei_, or witchcraft, wa someth that wa 
never doubt or scof at by hi people. then whi should he, a good 
pennsylvania dutchman, doubt or scoff at such tradition? 

perhaps, had he move away from hi ancestr land and had been 
cultur in modern communities, been educ and rais in other 
schools, he might have matured. but have no time for ani other 
divers than might be found on hi rustic homestead, he grew up 
behind the plow horse, tramp in the dark, stoni pastur land, eke 
out hi meager exist from the black field of pennsylvania. 

now, peter' life could have gone on unnot among these forgotten 
hills, except for the strang visit of martin G. mirestone, student of 
german history. 

It wa a cold night when peter met mirestone. peter had been sit up 
rather late ponder over an old, yellow book by the light of a 
kerosen lamp. the pale flame flicker about the wall send shadow 
scurri back and forth creat all type of weird shape and designs. 
peter huddl over the wither pages, everi now and then glanc up at 
the wall to watch the fantast game that light and dark were playing. 
then put hi book asid for the night he prepar to go to bed. 

He went over to the window to draw the shutters, stop for an instant 
to peer out into the gloom along the stoni path that ran from hi hous 
to an old foot-bridg about fifti feet away. curl up from the gorge, 
mist seem to play among the rot planks; it rose and fell in great 
billow blankets, sometim conceal the structur from view. 

* * * * * 

peter wa about to latch the shutter and leav when hi attent wa 
focus upon a figur that seem to emerg from the fog--sort of fade 
in from nowhere. It made it way across the narrow span like some 
ghostli apparition. the mist envelop hi leg and cloud hi 
features. peter drew back in terror, for the mere appear of the man 
come out of the dark wa enough to fill hi infant brain with 
vision of death and _hexerei_. 

As the figur drew closer peter saw that it wa wear a cloak. all the 
more ghostli it appear with the cloak sail behind him in the wind 
like some devil' banner. peter just stood transfix as he watch the 
stranger come up the wind road to hi house. 

slam the shutter he hurriedli fasten it and then turn to the 
door to bolt that also. too late. the door wa thrown open reveal a 
tall man cloth in black. hi face wa wreath in a wide grin--a grin 
that seem to make fun of the grayish pallor of hi face and the 
omin appear of hi wild garb. befor the man step inside, 
peter made a mental imag of the scene, for it wa to be firmli imbed 
in hi mind so that he would never forget the slightest detail for the 
rest of hi life--th wind blow about the fierc visage, toss up 
the long strand of hair; the massive, vein hand that clutch the 
wrought iron thumb-latch, and the way that the lamp struck hi face, 
highlight the thin, ridg nose and high cheekbones. 

"peter scheinberger, heh?" the man spoke in perfect german. "peter 
scheinberger, the last of your clan here in america." 

It wa sever second befor peter could muster up enough courag to 
answer him. draw back slowli he brace himself against the table, and 
in a thick, guttur german asked, "who are you?" 

the stranger shut the door and drew the bolt. He cross the room and, 
with an air of one who wa accustom to have hi own way wherev he 
went, scan the shelv of peter' larder with a practic eye. 

peter watch him close as he drew down a bottl of wine, broke the 
neck against a beam abov him, and settl down in peter' easi chair. 
He pour a glass full and shove it across the tabl toward the 
anxiou peter, and then pour anoth glass for himself. 

"mirestone," the stranger final answered, "martin G. mirestone." then, 
drain hi glass, he added, "student of german history." 

all thi wa beyond peter' comprehension. No one ever had the audac 
to walk into hi hous and help himself to whatev he wanted--h wa 
inde unheard of in hi tini social world. 

"well, what are you stare at?" mireston boom out. "take my cloak, 
please, then be seated. we'll talk." 

take the cloak and drape it over a wooden peg in the wall, peter 
move cautious around the forebod charact that monopol hi 
small house. care seat himself opposit the man, he move the 
tabl so that it set between them as a protect barrier. 

"i'll make myself clear to you," mireston explained, "for I want my 
stay to be as brief as possible." 

He pour himself anoth glass of wine, then settl back in the chair, 
half close hi eyes. "you see, I am a student, you might say, of 
german histori or folklore. I am in the process of write a collect 
histori of the pennsylvania dutch folk, their habits, beliefs, and--" he 
broke off for an instant as he lean forward across the table, stare 
into the frighten eye of peter "--and their superstitions." 

shift hi chair around in order to get benefit from the heat of the 
fireplace, mireston went on. "now I want facts, scheinberger, authent 
facts. I am prepar to pay you well for your trouble, but I insist on 
inform that is back up with sound, accur truth." 

peter becam more relax but still slightli uneasy. He didn't like the 
attitud of thi man, mirestone. He wa too sure of himself--altogeth 
too cocky. but then on the other hand he had said there would be a 
financi gain from ani busi that he could transact with him. money 
wa someth that peter knew he need in order to keep hi farm going, 
and ani income, howev small it may be, would be welcom gratefully. 
yes, he decid that he had better endur the rude of thi man. 

for a few seconds, however, the tall stranger seem to lose all of hi 
cockiness, and a somber look crept over hi jovial features. "have you 
ever heard of the hex of the white feather?" 

peter thought a moment befor he replied. "yes. I have heard of it." 
then nervous he finger hi glass of wine that he had not as yet 
touched. rais it up to hi lip he sip it slowli as he stare at 
mireston over the rim of the glass. "yes. I have heard of it," he 
repeated. 

"good, good. you have heard of it. now, you will tell me about it, of 
course. I want to know all about it--how it is practiced, the results, 
and so forth." 

"i that whi you came here? onli to learn of the white feather hex?" 

* * * * * 

mireston climb to hi feet and pace the room. "yes," he said. peter 
note a sad tone in hi voice, and he wait for him to say more. 

"yes," mireston continued. "I have, like you, heard of the hex of the 
white feather. I have trace it down to sever families, but none could 
tell me anyth about it that wa factual. half of the stupid fool 
made up stori as they went along--som concoct the biggest bunch of 
asinin tale that i'v ever heard. but you, peter, are a descend of 
the scheinbergers. I know for a fact that otto scheinberg practic 
the white feather hex and pass the power on down to your father. from 
there it stopped. however, there must be some record of it in your 
family. you are in possess of the book of your grandfather, aren't 
you?" 

"I have sever of hi books. some of them I have read." 

"well," mireston waited. "did you come across anyth about the hex?" 

"yes," answer peter. "I read about that which you mention." 

"splendid, now we are get somewhere. can you find me the book that 
tell of it?" 

peter finish drink hi wine and set the glass upon the table, 
he slowli rose and face mireston with a look of superior play 
about hi rustic features. "no, I am afraid not. you see, I have burn 
the book." 

mirestone' face went white. "you burn it?" 

"yes," said peter. "I don't wish to have anyth to do with such black 
magic. It is better burned." 

"but you must rememb the hex. although the book is destroy you still 
have the inform in your head, _nein_?" 

"I could never forget it if I want to," repli peter reluctantly. "if 
I could burn my memori also it would be better." 

mireston went back to the fireplac and place sever chunk of wood 
on the blaze. A bright orang glow leap out from the hearth and danc 
mockingli over hi pallid brow, hide hi lank jowl in the shadow 
cast by the cheekbones. like some grim spectr he rose up, tower 
abov the littl dutchman. peter had onli to look into hi eye to see 
the imper request that linger behind the hollow sockets. 

* * * * * 

throughout the remaind of the night peter, almost in spite of himself, 
wrack hi brain to bring back to mind everyth that wa mention in 
the book about the hex of the white feather. the idea wa clear enough, 
but the minut details, the infinit possibl for mistake, and the 
exact specif concern the experi were blur in hi 
memory. He knew that with time he could bring back everyth that he 
had read, but it would take deep concentr and, perhaps, mani day 
of trial and error to determin the right path that they must follow in 
order to have success. 

mirestone, realiz that ani distract would break peter' train of 
thought, sat quietli in the corner finish off the dutchman' suppli 
of wine. He watch peter close through hi slit eyes, and it 
seem that hi compel stare wa the onli forc that could drive the 
frighten peter on. everi so often peter would glanc up and see 
mireston lean back in the corner half conceal by the deep 
shadows--onli hi partial open eye could be seen flicker in the 
fieri glow of the hearth. then he would cover hi face with hi large, 
knot hands, work the twist finger through hi hair, and tri to 
bring back to mind the evil recipe. 

the glow from the fireplac gradual die down to make room for the 
stream of morn dawn. peter blink sleepili and got up to stretch a 
bit. outsid the dull morn light work it way over peter' 
farm--cloud of mist still pour up from the gorge, circl the bridg 
and creep up the bank across the fields. peter unlatch the heavi 
oaken door and went outsid to the outbuildings. 

meanwhile, mireston had start a fire in the stove and wa place 
slab of bacon in the pan. "noth like a good old-fashion peasant' 
breakfast," he laugh as peter came in the door sever minut later. 
"so, you brought a goat, heh?" he noticed. "are you figur on start 
in soon?" 

peter set a small kid on the floor and watch it scamper about the 
room, look for an exit. "yes, we might as well. I don't like thi 
busi at all. I wish to get it over with as soon as possible, 
and----" peter eye mireston squarely. "I expect to be paid well for my 
trouble." He wa tri to make himself believ that that wa hi onli 
reason for compli with mirestone' demands. actual he wa not so 
sure.... 

* * * * * 

As the heat of the noon day sun blast down on their backs, mireston 
watch peter pass a feather, freshli pluck from a white leghorn, 
under the nose of the bleat kid. mireston listen care to what 
peter wa tell him. the breath of the victim had to be spread over 
the feather befor anyth further could be done. 

"tie him," command peter. mireston held the goat by the scruff of hi 
neck and fasten a halter about him. the other end wa secur to a 
stake allow the kid to run about in a circl of ten feet or so in 
diameter. 

"we will leav him for awhile," said peter as he walk back to the 
kitchen. 

mireston follow in the dutchman' footsteps, and when they were 
inside, he listen intent as peter recit a monosyllab chant over 
the feather. "the chant is easi enough to learn," peter assur him. 
"you will master it quickly." 

"I understand so far," mireston said. 

"then that is all," peter finished, "except that you can hang the 
feather up and watch it grow red." 

"red?" 

"yes," peter explained, "that is the onli way you can tell if the hex 
ha worked." 

peter went to a chest at the foot of hi bed and drew out a small box of 
sew utensils. He broke off a piec of black thread and replac the 
box in the chest. "now i'll show you what I mean," peter spoke wearili 
as he tie the feather with the thread and suspend it from one of the 
rafter in the room. "just sit and watch." 

It wa not mani minut befor a light red tint crept up the feather' 
quill, spread slowli outward toward the fring edges. deeper and 
deeper grew the intens of the color until it reach a pure blood 
red. 

"hurri outside," cri peter. "you can see the goat in it last second 
of life." 

mireston hurri after the dutchman. jerk at the halter the goat 
bleat in agony, pranc up and down frantically. it eye grew 
horribl bloodshot and final closed. with a feeble, choke sigh, the 
anim drop over on it side, it leg still twitch spasmodically. 
mireston bent over the hairi form and examin the head, now wet with 
perspiration. 

"noth can be done for the beast?" 

"no." peter look on with a touch of piti in hi eyes, "noth can be 
done onc the feather ha turn red." 

As if the death of the kid wa their cue, mass of thick thunderhead 
turn over with a deep rumbl thunder. the sky becam crystal clear, 
and a greenish glow could be seen work it way across the horizon. 
the sky darken as the glisten thunderhead now take on an omin 
color warn the farmer of the impend storm. 

It wa later that evening. rain drum against the slate roof of 
peter' hous and reverber through the room to where mireston and 
the dutchman sat by the fire in silence. mireston broke the still 
atmospher by put forth a question that peter somehow knew would be 
come sooner or later. 

"I wonder how the hex would react on a human being?" 

peter hope to end the topic by answer him quickli and not beat 
around the bush tri to evad the question. "it would kill him 
eventually. mayb not so quick as the goat, but it would kill him." 

"what do you mean not as quickli as the goat--do you think it would take 
more time on a human?" 

"perhaps. I have heard of case in which the hex, onc it wa started, 
drag on for mani days." 

"I see." mireston sat back again think to himself. 

peter didn't like this. He want to get rid of mirestone. "well, you 
have your information. I show you how the hex works. so, whi not pay 
me and leave?" 

mireston got up and laugh in the dutchman' face. cross to the 
larder, he brought down a bottle, crack the neck on the beam above, 
just as he had done the night before. A wave of apprehens overcam 
peter as he realiz the old flip attitud of mirestone' wa come 
back. that meant definit trouble, and peter began to fear the 
consequences. 

"so, whi not pay me and leave?" he again ventured. "or do you want 
someth else?" peter knew that he didn't need to ask that last 
question, for alreadi he realiz the grim experi that wa play 
about in mirestone' head. 

"yes. I just told you what I wanted. I want to see the hex on a human 
befor I go." 

"why? you have your information. whi do you want to see it work on a 
man?" 

"mi stupid, littl peasant friend, do I look like a student of history?" 

for the first time peter actual look at mireston and saw him for 
what he was. Of course, he couldn't be a student. No student would act 
as he did, or even look as he did. the word jam in hi throat as he 
wa about to voic a reply. 

"ha--martin G. mirestone, student of history, student of german history. 
No my littl oxen friend. I am no more a student of histori than you 
are, but I need the hex for other reason which do not concern you." 
then as if he were contempl a great new joke he continued. "but on 
the other hand, mayb the futur of the white feather hex doe concern 
you." 

mirestone' voic wa drown out by a heavi rumbl of thunder and the 
increas splash of rain on the windows. but somehow peter seem not 
to notice. 

* * * * * 

somewhat later mireston step quietli over to the sleep form of 
hi host. peter had been over twenty-four hour now without sleep, and 
although the old dutchman had tri desper to fight off the 
drowsi that overcam him, the recent excit of the day had 
final taken it toll. lightn struck near by follow with an ear 
split blast that shook the hous to it rocki foundations. piec of 
slate flew off the roof and were carri away into the night. the rain 
pour down in a great deluge, blur the window, make it imposs 
to see in or out. 

mireston held out a glisten white feather in hi long spideri 
fingers. He place it within a few inch of peter' nose and watch 
the delic edg riffl in the dutchman' breath. cross to the 
table, he lean over the white fluff and breath the short german 
incant over it. how it glisten in the firelight! He bent closer 
and closer as he whisper the magic word that peter had taught him, 
hi breath ruffl the feather, play about in the fring softness. 
He hung up the feather by a thread and watch it hop back and forth in 
the center of the room. 

* * * * * 

peter awaken and saw mireston sit by the fire note everi 
movement of the feather. "what are you doing, heh?" 

mireston swung around and glare at the bleari eye dutchman. "sit 
down," he commanded. "sit down and watch the feather turn red." 

peter didn't need to be told that it wa hi feather. He knew by the 
merciless eye of mireston that everyth wa over. "so, you were 
determin to find out what would happen if the hex were tri on a 
man?" 

peter wa surpris at how easili he took hi fate. there wa no need of 
excitement--thi wa hi end and there wa no chang it. 

"yes, I had to know, for I can't leav until I have a complet record of 
all the results." mireston certainli wa not cocki now. He look 
almost asham of himself as he sat there nervous watch a man' 
fate swing by a silken thread. "i'm sorry, peter, my friend, but that is 
how it must be. you are a step stone to a gloriou reckon that 
will soon take place. the hex of the white feather--i can hardli believ 
that I have at last track it down. and you, peter, are the last 
witness, the last link in the chain of those who know the secret, and 
how can it better end than by your becom a part of the secret?" 

peter realiz that he had not much longer to live and noth he could 
do to mireston would chang hi fate. perhap he could save others, 
though. 

"what is thi gloriou reckon you were speak about?" 

"a soon as I see how your case ends, i'll be abl to go ahead and 
releas my vengeanc on those stupid, bungl fool who have thwart 
my progress in the black arts. they claim to speak in the name of 
humanity, no less!" 

"in that case," exclaim peter, "I won't let myself be a foothold for 
your damn work--it is of the devil and i'll have no part of it." 

"shut up, fool. you are a part of it already." 

"not if my bodi is destroy befor you can get hold of it." 

peter play hi trump card. He quickli sprang back and slip out the 
door into the storm. mireston jump up after him, but it wa too late. 
He peer out into the rage tempest make out the figur of peter 
struggl with the hatch on the hors barn. He pull hi cloak about 
him and start toward peter to stop him. the rain beat hi face, 
blind him momentarily, and befor he could see clearli a dark mass 
pound by, swift hoof spatter mud all over him. 

down the road sped peter on the horse--down the road and toward the 
foot-bridge. mireston ran a few step and halted. He heard the hollow 
staccato of horse' hoof on the plank for an instant, follow by a 
splinter crash that rumbl up from the gorge. A long, guttur cri 
pierc the black gloom as man and hors plung down to the seeth 
death await them. 

curs savagely, mileston trudg back through the rain to the house. 
He slam the door shut and threw hi cloak on peter' bed. there wa 
one more bottl on the shelf; he smash the neck and pour a glass. If 
one could see him bent over the tabl send silent curs into hi 
wine, he could readili imagin the feel of defeat that had spread 
over mirestone' countenance. the idiot of a dutchman who had to play 
the hero' part and save other live by end hi own made mireston 
fairli sick. however, all wa not over. So the dutchman had died; the 
hex had worked--a lot sooner than he had expect though. now he 
certainli would be delay in hi progress, for he had count on 
examin the bodi for ani trace left that would suggest someth out 
of the ordinary. one thing, however, he had learn wa that the hex at 
least work on humans. the mangl bodi that wa be wash over the 
rock would be enough proof on that score. 

mireston pour anoth drink. He lean back in the chair and place 
the glass to hi lips. He wa tilt so far back that as he rais the 
wine to a drink position, it block hi view of the room. As he 
slowli sip it, however, the room began to come into view--th ceil 
first and slowli the wall. hi eye focus on a piec of thread hang 
from the ceiling, and as the wine sank lower and lower in the glass, the 
thread grew longer and longer until in one last swallow he wa abl to 
see the end of the line. 

mirestone' hand went stiff as he look at the thread, for on the end 
of it wa a pure white feather. 

* * * * * 

In an instant mireston realiz that the hex had not worked. peter' 
death at the bridg had been a grotesqu coincidence. had the untim 
plung in the rapid been the result of the hex the feather would have 
long sinc been red, therefore, the tragedi wa no more than an accid 
and mirestone' hand were innoc of the dutchman' blood. that 
realization, of course, didn't bother him, for he wa not concern 
whether or not he wa respons for peter' death, but he wa 
genuin worri in the failur of the hex. He wonder if he had done 
someth wrong. If he had, the last link, that could have correct him 
wa broken. from here on in he wa on hi own. 

He calm himself and began to think. He retrac everyth that he had 
done to see if he couldn't have found some margin in which error could 
have crept in. He rememb how care he had bent over the feather 
recit the exact word taught him by peter. He especi rememb 
that part of the hex, for hadn't the feather been ruffl by hi breath 
when he spoke.... 

gradual the truth began to dawn on mirestone. hi own breath must have 
releas peter from the hex. the last person' breath that touch the 
feather would feel the sting of the power. mireston sat back 
dumbfounded. He wa to be hi own guinea pig. what ghastli horror wa he 
in for? would he die quickli like the goat or would hi death be 
prolong over a period of day like peter had suggested. He grip 
himself. It wouldn't do to lose control of hi senses. there must be a 
way out of the predicament. but peter said that as soon as the feather 
turn red there wa no turn back. ah--there' the answer. the 
feather is still white ... there' still a chance. 

mireston grab hi cloak and race for the door. He must get an 
animal--anoth goat, perhaps, and expos the feather to it breath. He 
must hurri lest the spell will start working. 

the slipperi mud drag him back and imped hi progress, but he 
struggl on through the blind storm toward the barn. It wa so 
black outsid that he could hardli make out the buildings. all at onc 
he saw the barn loom ahead of him. which door? everi second counted; 
he would tri the first one he came to. wait--what' thi hold hi 
cloak? mireston turn and fumbl with some barb wire fencing. It 
had snag him in the dark, and he soon becam hopelessli entangl in 
it. cri and shrieking, he tore the cloak from hi shoulder and ran 
on in hi shirt sleeves. He wrench open a door and sprawl in the 
barn head first. On hi hand and knee he scurri across the meali 
floor to the goat stall. the kid sprang in terror as he lurch in 
drunkenly, grab about in the dark for one of them. catch one by 
the hind leg, he grope hi way out again. 

thrust hi shoulder forward he slid through the grip mud, 
tear hi way through the engulf rain with hi free hand. hi leg 
left numb from the wound inflict by the barb wire, and a trickl of 
blood wa run down hi shins. without think he reach down to 
rub the wound, but quickli yank hi hand up again. what wa that 
horribl sensat he felt as he pass hi hand over the fleshi sore? 
He couldn't see in the rain, but hi leg told him that it wa someth 
hairy, almost bristly. 

He ran on toward the house, stumbl in the treacher mud. onc he 
fell complet down in the slime. wipe the drip earth from hi 
face, he wa told again that someth wa wrong. hi cheek verifi 
hi shin' stori of a rough, jag caress. 

hold hi hand in front of hi face he saw, amidst a flash of 
lightning, a curling, black claw, bristl with long, rag hairs. 
scream hyster he drop the kid and fell forward into the door 
of the house. the latch gave way with hi weight and he tumbl into the 
cottage. 

danc madli on the end of a thread wa a blood red feather.
