[sidenote: _creeping, writhing, insidi crawl and groping, the 
long arm reach out in it ghastli errand of death_] 

prefac 
I had been out of germani for thirty-f years, drawn hither and 
thither by variou glitter of will-of-the-wisps. when I return to 
my nativ country, I wa as poor in pocket as when I left, and much 
poorer in illusions. 

the berlin insur compani which I had repres with such mediocr 
success in switzerland, austria and belgium agre to let me sell for 
them at home, and by a curiou coincid there wa an open in the 
quaint old bavarian citi in which I had been born and bred. 

I will pass over the strang mingl feel with which I rode in a 
twentieth centuri railroad train past the thousand-year-old wall of one 
of the most curiou ancient citi in europe, a town moreov whose 
everi wind narrow street and sharp-gabl build had been the 
companion of my infanc and childhood. No one seem to know me, and I 
recogn no one. for sever day I made no attempt to sell life 
insurance, but wander in a dream, the bewild ghost of my former 
self, about the spot which I had known in happier days. 

one dull raini afternoon I took refug from the weather in a dingi 
littl coffee-hous in which, at the age of fourteen or fifteen, I along 
with certain boon companions, had learn the gentl art of billiards. 
It seem as if everi articl of furnitur wa just as I had walk away 
from them, well toward half a centuri before. It wa rain outside, 
and I sat alon in the gloomy, smoki old place, ponder the sweet and 
bitter mysteri of life. 

while I sat thus, stare out with unse eye at the rain which wa 
by thi time beat down smartli on the pavement, I becam consciou 
that someon in the room wa stare at me. I had not notic that there 
wa anyon els in the dark, low-ceiling place except the obsequi 
proprietor who had serv me my cigar and coffee. now I realiz that a 
man who sat in the corner diagon across from me wa studi me 
curious from over hi newspaper. hi face wa one that I had seen 
before. suddenly, across all the years, I rememb him. and in that 
same moment he rose and came toward me with hi hand held out. 

We had been in school together, in the gymnasium. He had been a strang 
fellow with few friends, but had enjoy the reput of be the 
best student in hi class. but in hi last year in the gymnasium he had, 
for what reason I never knew, excit the animos of a cantanker 
old professor who had publicli declar that gustav wa not the kind of 
boy who should have a gymnasium diploma and that he, the professor, wa 
determin never to give him a pass grade. My father had admir the 
boy veri much, and at one junctur when my mark look peril low, 
he had employ gustav to tutor me. gustav had been so success that 
father wa delight and made him a present of a silver cigarett case 
with gustav' initi and mine engrav on it. I rememb all thi 
veri distinctli as we shook hands, but I wa do fast thinking, 
becaus for the life of me I couldn't rememb hi strang last name. I 
had a feel that it wa a veri foreign name, polish or croatian or 
someth of the sort. As he mention thi and that, I fear I answer 
him a littl absent and incoherently. the name wa almost there. the 
syllabl flit tantalizingli just out of my reach. but I wa sure the 
name began with a B. wasn't it a bam- or a ban-something? ah! I had it. 
banaotovich! 

from that moment the convers went more easily. I wa surpriz and 
pleas when banaotovich drew hi silver cigarette-cas out of hi 
pocket to prove to me how highli he thought of my poor deceas father. 
We were soon launch on a cordial exchang of childhood memories. 
banaotovich seem a good-heart fellow after all, and I wonder whi 
in my childhood I had never been quit comfort in hi company. I 
rememb that other boy of the group had admit to me 
confidenti that they were more than a littl afraid of him. 

* * * * * 

the longer we talk the more intimate, the more in the natur of a 
mutual confession, our convers became. I admit to banaotovich 
that the hifalutin fashion in which I had left the town to win fame and 
fortun year before, had been asinin in the extreme, and that it 
serv me just right to have to sneak back unknown and penniless. 
banaotovich rejoin that for all hi pride in hi school mark he had 
remain a person of no importance, and that the pot had not the 
slightest intent of make itself ridicul by call the kettl 
black. He seem almost pain inclin to run himself down. I could 
feel in hi manner a sort of pathet reach out for sympathi and 
consideration. and it began to seem as if he were about to tell me 
someth or ask me for something. but whatev he had to tell seem 
hard to say, and it wa slow in come over hi lips. 

banaotovich order two bottl of the heavi nativ wine. I drank 
sparingli of it, becaus it goe to my head. but banaotovich swallow 
two or three glass in hasti succession, and hi cheek grew flushed. 
there wa a pause. suddenli he lean across the tabl toward me and 
spoke in a hoarse, excit whisper. 

"modersohn," he said anxiously, "I want to make a confess to you--a 
terribl confession. It may turn you against me completely. mayb you 
don't want to hear it. If you don't, say so, and i'll go home. but it 
seem as if i'v got to tell somebodi about it. It seem as if i'v got 
to find somebodi who understand me and can excus me, or it will kill 
me. shall I tell you? shall i?" 

I wa startled. I wa reason sure that banaotovich wa no criminal, 
sinc he had live half a centuri in hi nativ city, undisturb and 
from all he had told me solvent and respected. I had alway known that 
he wa a queer fish, a brooding, solitari sort of person, and I settl 
myself to listen to some harmless bit of psychopathi which meant noth 
except to the unfortun subject. 

"mi dear fellow," I said, no doubt a littl patronizingly, "I am sure 
you haven't anyth to confess that will make you out an outrag 
rascal, but if it will do you ani good to tell me your troubles, I am 
readi to listen to them." 

"thank you," said banaotovich in a trembl voice. "i'v done noth 
that they can put me behind the bar for. but i--i----" 

He stare at me sternly. 

"but i'v done wors things," he said solemnly, "than some poor fellow 
that have been strung up by the neck and choke to death!" 

I laughed, a littl nervously. "tell me your story, if you like," I 
said, "and let me decid just how black you are. but I haven't a great 
deal of apprehension. we'r all of us poor miser sinners, as far as 
that' concerned. I could tell you thing about myself----" 

banaotovich wa not listen to me at all. He had fallen suddenli into 
a fit of black brooding. after a minut or two, he look up and ask 
sharply: 

"do you rememb wolansky?" 

wolanski wa the greek professor who had threaten to vote against 
banaotovich when he wa finish hi cours at the gymnasium. 

"of course," said I. "and I rememb well how he abus you that last 
year. If there ever wa a cantanker old scoundrel, wolanski wa just 
that ident individual!" 

"maybe," he said absently; then after anoth pause: 

"do you rememb that wolanski die suddenly, just a littl while befor 
the end of the school year?" 

I nodded. "I imagin that wa a great piec of good luck for you," I 
said. 

"yes," said banaotovich. "if he had lived, I should never have had my 
diploma. As it was, I finish with honors. If wolanski hadn't die when 
he did, i'd have been ruined. don't forget that--ruined!" 

I wa puzzl at hi insistence. "yes, you would have been serious 
handicapped," I agreed. "ruin is the word, perhaps." 

banaotovich' face wa purpl with wine and some strang kind of 
suffering. "do you rememb anoth thing?" he said thickly. "do you 
rememb an old hindoo who had a dark littl hole away back of the shop 
and the beer depot and the liveri stabl between the old market and the 
river?" 

"the old fellow that had love charm and told fortun and help peopl 
to health and wealth and happiness?" I said in a tone of slightli forc 
cheerfulness. It wa hard to be cheer with those somber eye bore 
into you. "yes, I rememb him, all right. I want to go and see him 
once, when I wa about fifteen or sixteen, but father told me that 
meddl with the black art had sent more peopl to hell than it had 
helped. and father wa so terribl earnest about it that he frighten 
me. I never went. As a matter of fact it wa onli a pass fancy, and I 
soon forgot all about him." 

"that hindoo," said my old school-fellow thoughtfully, "knew thing 
about the secret forc in the univers that made him almost a god. and 
he taught me thing that the wisest philosoph in the world doesn't 
suspect. still, your father may have been right. I think it veri like 
that what he taught me may send me to hell!" 

I shivered. I look up nervous to make sure that the way wa clear to 
the door. I began to suspect that my friend banaotovich, though he wa 
certainli not a criminal, might be a danger lunatic. 

My _vis-à-vis_ rub absent at a protuber on hi left side. I had 
notic it when he first came across the room to speak to me. A 
deformity--i wa sure it had not been there when he wa a boy--or 
perhap a tumor or some such thing as that. 

"I kept veri quiet about what the hindoo taught me, becaus I knew most 
peopl felt about such thing much as you say your father did. and I 
want to get on in the world. but I had an idea the hindoo could help 
me get on. perhap he _has_----" 

and he stare gloomili at space. 

"perhap he has. and perhap he hasn't." 

He brooded. then he took up the thread of hi story. 

"wolanski nearli drove me to suicide. I read and studi and crammed, 
day and night. I tri everyth I could think of to overcom the man' 
antagonism. I crawl in the dust befor him like a whip cur! noth 
did ani good. and when I saw he hate me and wa determin to smash me, 
I began to hate _him_, too. I came to hate him wors than I hate the 
devil in hell. there wa a time when I had to hold myself back with all 
my strength to keep from stick a knife into him or brain him with 
a chair. but the hindoo and I made some experi with telepathy, and 
I discov that there are other way of kill a man besid stab 
him or give him poison. 

"I learn how to make a man in front of me on the street turn around 
and look at me. I learn how to make _you_ dream about me and come and 
tell me the dream the next morning," (when he said that, I jumped, for I 
rememb have done exactli that thing!). "I learn how to bring out 
a bruis on wolansky' face although he live on the other side of town; 
so that he went around ask peopl how he could have bump hi 
forehead without know it. and at last I went to bed one night, set my 
mind on wolansky, and said over and over to myself a thousand times: 
die, you dog! you'v _got_ to die! I _order_ you to die! 

"I said it over till I fell into a sort of trance. It wasn't sleep, I 
tell you. you can't sleep when you are in a state like that. and in my 
trance, I could feel anoth arm grow out of my side here and grow 
longer and longer, and grow out through the window although the window 
wa closed, and grow out across the street and down the street and right 
through the wall and across the river. 

"I had never known where wolanski lived. but that night I knew. I had 
never known the street or the hous number. I had never been there in my 
life. but I can tell you just exactli how hi bedroom looked. the 
wash-stand between the two windows, the work-tabl against the west 
wall, the wardrobe, the old divan against the north wall. In a corner 
the blue-gray tile stove with some of the tile chip off. and against 
the south wall--th bed he lay in. I can tell you the color of the 
blanket he pull up over hi face. It wa a dirti brownish red. 

"but my hand seem to go through the blanket and grip wolanski by the 
throat. first he sigh and turn hi head to one side and tri to 
wriggl free. then he rais hi arm and tri to get hold of someth 
that wasn't there. hi sigh turn into groans, and the groan chang 
to a death rattle. He threw hi arm and leg wildli around in the air, 
hi bodi bent up like a bow. but my hand held hi head down against the 
pillow. At last he quit struggl and drop down limp on the bed. 
then the arm came crawl back in to my body, and I came out of the 
trance--and went to sleep--or perhap I fainted. 

"the next morn the director came into our classroom and told us 
wolanski had die in the night of some sort of attack. you rememb 
that, I am sure----" 

when banaotovich began to tell me thi story, he had look away from 
me, and hi eye never met mine dure the telling. He had begun with a 
pain effort, but as he went on he grew more and more excit and more 
and more inflam with hatr of the malici old greek teacher, till 
it almost seem as if he had forgotten me and wa live the astound 
experi through for himself alone. when he wa through, hi ecstasi 
of indign left him and he sat deject and apprehensive, studi 
me piti out of the corner of hi deep gray eyes. 

* * * * * 

when he stop speaking, there wa a moment of silence. then I said 
something. I think what I said was, "veri extraordinary!" 

He smiled, a strained, sarcast smile. "extraordinary?" he repeated, 
with an interrog point in hi voice. 

"your nerv were strain to the breaking-point," I said. "your troubl 
with the old rascal had driven you half distracted. then there wa all 
that occultist hodgepodg with the old hindoo. and you were overwork 
and run down, anyway. No wonder you dream dream and saw visions. and 
it may have been that there wa some telepath contact between you and 
wolansky, and when he had hi apoplect attack----" 

the sarcast smile deepen on banaotovich' face. "so you have it all 
explained, and i'm acquitted?" he inquired. 

"acquitted?" I cried. "you were never even accused. If the state were to 
bring action against everi man who had a feel that he would be 
happier if someon els were out of the way, the state would have a big 
job on it hands!" 

"veri true," banaotovich assent icily. "I see I haven't got veri far 
with you yet. you are forc me to continu my not veri edifi 
autobiography.--did you know my father?" 

I rememb hi father, and I rememb that he had not enjoy the 
best possibl reputation. 

"I think I knew him," I said hesitantly. "he wa a--a money-lender, 
wasn't he?" 

"don't spare my feelings," said banaotovich bitterly. "he wa a usurer, 
and a cruel one. I had a feel for year that hi busi wa a 
disgrac to the family, and I made no bone about tell him so. there 
were ugli scenes. I thought sever time of leav home. finally, 
father told me one day that sinc I didn't approv of the way he got hi 
money, he wa do me the favor of disinherit me. I told him that 
wa all right with me, that i'd rather starv than live on money that 
wa stain with the blood of poor debtors. 

"I thought at the time that I meant it. but about that time I had becom 
interest in a young woman. I had never had much to do with the girls, 
and veri few of them seem at all interest in me. but thi one 
appear to like me, and when I made advanc to her, she didn't repel 
me. I am no connoisseur of femal beauty, but I think she wa unusu 
attractive, and at that time I wa half mad about her. still water run 
deep, you know. 

"well, she had me under her spell so complet that I chang my mind 
about father' money. I began to truckl to him, much as I had truckl 
to wolansky. I began to feel him out to find whether he had made a will. 
He wa veri cold and non-committal. final I ask him outright if he 
would reconsid hi decis to leav me penniless. He told me it wa I 
that had made the decision, not he, and that he had no use for 
wishy-washi peopl that chang their mind like weather-cocks. He wa 
veri sarcastic. I lost my temper and answer him back. We had a 
terribl quarrel, and final he--h struck me. I wa twenti year old 
and a bigger man than he. and I think no man ever had more stubborn 
pride, at bottom, than I have. 

"it wa the wolanski thing all over again. the humiliation, the effort 
at ingratiation, the failure, the long, eating, gnawing, grow hatred. 
and it--it end the same way. the night of brood that harden into 
a devilish decision, the vision of the long arm, growing, stretching, 
crawling--but not so far thi time, onli through two wall and across 
our own house. you rememb that father die of an apoplect stroke, 
just as wolanski had done a year or two before." 

"yes, I think I remember," I said in consider embarrassment. the 
thing _did_ begin to look uncanny. I wa thoroughli sorri for the poor, 
crack fellow, but I would just as soon not have been alon with him in 
that solitari drinking-plac in the twilight. 

"well?" he said, almost sharply. 

"well, banaotovich," I answer with a show of confidence, "you have had 
a great deal of unhappiness, and you have my sympathy. thi strang 
faculti you have of anticip deaths, like the night-owl and the 
death-watch that tick in the walls, ha made these bereav an 
occas of self-tor for you. I think you should see a 
psychiatrist." 

"anticipating--anticipating?" banaotovich had gone back and wa 
repeat a word I had used, and as he repeat it he drum madli on 
the tabl with hi fingers. "it' a curiou coincid that 
'anticipating' is just the word my wife use when I told her about it." 

"you--told--your wife--what you have just told me?" I stammered. "do you 
think that wa wise?" 

"I couldn't help it," he said with a catch in hi throat. "I thought I 
love her, and I had to talk to somebody. I wa miserable, and I had a 
feel that she might understand and be brought closer to me by 
sympathy. now that I think of it, I can see that I wa an egregi 
idiot, but I discov long ago that we aren't ration be after 
all. We are driven or drawn by mysteri forces, and we go to our 
destin becaus we can't help it. 

"mi wife had alway seem a littl timid with me. I never seem to 
have the gift of attract people. and I don't know whether she would 
ever have been interest in me at all if I hadn't use a little--a 
littl charm the hindoo taught me. perhap that didn't have much to do 
with it--but I had never been happi with her. howev that may be, one 
even when she seem unusu approachable, I had just the same 
impuls that I had when I met you here tonight, and I told her about 
wolanski and father. she pooh-pooh it all just as you did. but she wa 
afraid. I could see that. she wa more and more afraid of me as the day 
went by. for a long time she tri to be cordial and natur in my 
presence, but it wa a sham and the poor thing couldn't keep it up. each 
of us knew as well what wa in the mind of the other as if we had talk 
the situat over frankli for hours. We reach the point where we 
couldn't look each other in the face. No solitud could have been as 
ghastli as that solitud of two peopl who share a revolt secret. 
for I had convinc her that I wa guilty. I had succeed in do what 
I had set out to do, and I had ruin two live in do it. I have the 
faculty, it seems, of poison whatev I touch. onli today, my wife 
said to me----" 

I start to my feet with a great rush of relief and thankfulness. "ah, 
your wife is alive, then?" I cried. 

"mi wife is alive. that is--mi _second_ wife is alive," he said, with a 
horribl forc smile. 

I sank back gasping. "what did you do with your first wife, you dirti 
hound?" I moan in helpless indignation. 

* * * * * 

He close hi eyes, and a wave of bitter triumph play about the 
muscl of hi mouth. "have I convinc _you_ too, at last?" he said. 

then I realiz that I had been an insult idiot. At worst, the man 
befor me wa a patholog case, and he certainli belong in an 
asylum rather than in a prison. 

"forgiv me, banaotovich," I panted. "I don't know what made me----" 

He look at me sadly, almost compassionately. "there is noth to 
forgive," he said, veri quietly. "I am all you call me and a thousand 
time worse. now let me finish my story." 

"you don't need to," I said hastily. "I know all the rest of it." 

all interest, I am afraid nearli all sympathy, had gone out of me. what 
I want most of all wa to get away from thi melancholi citizen with 
power and mad in hi gray eyes. 

"no, you don't know quit all of it yet," he insisted. "perhap if I 
tell you the whole story, even if you can't excus me--and I don't 
deserv your excusing, I don't _want_ your excusing--y can understand 
me a littl better, and think of me a littl more kindly. 

"there wa anoth woman. I couldn't help it, ani more than ani of us 
can help anything. A fine, sympathet young woman, who love me becaus 
she knew I wa unhappy. I had been marri to the other woman for four 
years. We were complet estranged. We could scarc bear to speak to 
each other. I couldn't be easi one moment in the same hous with her. I 
had a cot in my offic out in town becaus I couldn't even sleep soundli 
at home. It wa hell. the terror in her eye made me physic sick. My 
wife learn about the other woman. My wife wa a devout catholic, and 
there wa no possibl of a divorce. I could read in my wife' face 
just what went on in her mind. she knew the other woman had becom my 
onli reason for living. and one day I read in her eyes, along with the 
terror, a glint of desper determination. she knew she wa in danger, 
she knew I had a power that I could exercis when I chose in spite of 
all the court and polic and jail in the country. she knew her life 
wa in danger, and her eye told me that mine wa in danger for that 
veri reason. I didn't blame her. half my grief through all the year had 
been grief for _her_. but the instinct of self-defens in me wa 
strong--and--sh went--too--like----" 

[illustration: "and she went, too, like the other."] 

He never finish hi sentence. He drop hi head on the tabl and 
began to sob hysterically. I laid a gingerli hand on hi shoulder. 

"banaotovich," I said unsteadily, "i'm sorri for you----" 

He sat up and support hi chin in both hands. "I haven't been as--a 
bad as all thi sound like," he said after a while. "befor I wa 
marri a second time, I went to the chief of polic and gave myself up. 
the chief listen to my story--i didn't tri to explain it all, as i'v 
done with you, but just blurt out the main facts; but the longer he 
listen the uneasi he became, and when I got through he ask me 
nervous if I didn't think I ought to go into a sanitarium for a while. 
then he bow me out in a big hurry. perhap if I had told him all the 
in and out of it, it might have been different----" 

"but don't you think he' right about the sanitarium?" 

"right? i'm as sane as you are. i'v kill three people, a crazi 
scoundrel, a hard man, and a pure, innoc woman. but I did it all 
becaus I had to. A sanitarium wouldn't do me or anyon els ani good, 
and it would be a heavi expense. I have taken the respons for 
anoth pure, innoc woman, and I must support her. the war and the 
depress swept away my father' fortune, and my present busi ha 
dwindl away till I am make onli the barest living. I have appli 
for the agenc for a big berlin insur company, and if I can get it, 
along with my other business, I shall be fairli comfortable. but I 
understand there is some talk of their send in a repres from 
outside. If they do that, if they take the bread out of my mouth like 
that, it won't be good for the outsider!" 

He wa drunk, and hi drunken wa work him into an ugli mood. He 
wa dangerous, and physic courag wa never my strong point. 

"what is the name of the berlin company?" I ask timidly. 

He name the firm I myself work for. then he fumbl for hi bottle, 
and with stern and pain attent set about the difficult and 
delic task of fill hi glass again. I mutter someth about 
be back in a moment, and made for the door. He wa too busi to pay 
ani attent to me. 

when I had the door safe shut behind me, I sprint through the rain 
to my hotel as if the devil himself were after me.... 

* * * * * 

It wa a long time befor I got over wake up in the middl of the 
night with the feel that an icy, iron-muscl hand wa clutch at 
my throat. I don't have the experi often ani more, but I have never 
seen the citi of my birth sinc that aw night. I got out on the 
midnight train, and my compani obligingli gave me territori on the other 
side of germany. 

some time ago I happen to see a notic in the paper to the effect that 
a certain patient name G. banaotovich had die suddenli in the 
staatlich nervenheilanstalt in nuremberg. but I have met the name 
rather frequent of late, and I think it is a fairli common one. I 
didn't investigate.
