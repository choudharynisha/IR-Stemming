and other stori 

By W. W. jacob 




the monkey' paw 


I. 
prefac 
without, the night wa cold and wet, but in the small parlour of laburnam 
villa the blind were drawn and the fire burn brightly. father and son 
were at chess, the former, who possess idea about the game involv 
radic changes, put hi king into such sharp and unnecessari peril 
that it even provok comment from the white-hair old ladi knit 
placidli by the fire. 

"hark at the wind," said mr. white, who, have seen a fatal mistak 
after it wa too late, wa amiabl desir of prevent hi son from 
see it. 

"i'm listening," said the latter, grimli survey the board as he 
stretch out hi hand. "check." 

"I should hardli think that he'd come to-night," said hi father, with 
hi hand pois over the board. 

"mate," repli the son. 

"that' the worst of live so far out," bawl mr. white, with sudden 
and unlooked-for violence; "of all the beastly, slushy, out-of-the-way 
place to live in, thi is the worst. pathway' a bog, and the road' a 
torrent. I don't know what peopl are think about. I suppos becaus 
onli two hous in the road are let, they think it doesn't matter." 

"never mind, dear," said hi wife, soothingly; "perhap you'll win the 
next one." 

mr. white look up sharply, just in time to intercept a know glanc 
between mother and son. the word die away on hi lips, and he hid a 
guilti grin in hi thin grey beard. 

"there he is," said herbert white, as the gate bang to loudli and heavi 
footstep came toward the door. 

the old man rose with hospit haste, and open the door, wa heard 
condol with the new arrival. the new arriv also condol with 
himself, so that mrs. white said, "tut, tut!" and cough gentli as her 
husband enter the room, follow by a tall, burli man, beadi of eye and 
rubicund of visage. 

"sergeant-major morris," he said, introduc him. 

the sergeant-major shook hands, and take the proffer seat by the 
fire, watch contentedli while hi host got out whiskey and tumbler and 
stood a small copper kettl on the fire. 

At the third glass hi eye got brighter, and he began to talk, the 
littl famili circl regard with eager interest thi visitor from 
distant parts, as he squar hi broad shoulder in the chair and spoke 
of wild scene and doughti deeds; of war and plagu and strang 
peoples. 

"twenty-on year of it," said mr. white, nod at hi wife and son. 
"when he went away he wa a slip of a youth in the warehouse. now look 
at him." 

"he don't look to have taken much harm," said mrs. white, politely. 

"i'd like to go to india myself," said the old man, "just to look round a 
bit, you know." 

"better where you are," said the sergeant-major, shake hi head. He 
put down the empti glass, and sigh softly, shook it again. 

"I should like to see those old templ and fakir and jugglers," said 
the old man. "what wa that you start tell me the other day about a 
monkey' paw or something, morris?" 

"nothing," said the soldier, hastily. "leastway noth worth hearing." 

"monkey' paw?" said mrs. white, curiously. 

"well, it' just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps," said the 
sergeant-major, offhandedly. 

hi three listen lean forward eagerly. the visitor absent-mindedli 
put hi empti glass to hi lip and then set it down again. hi host 
fill it for him. 

"to look at," said the sergeant-major, fumbl in hi pocket, "it' just 
an ordinari littl paw, dri to a mummy." 

He took someth out of hi pocket and proffer it. mrs. white drew 
back with a grimace, but her son, take it, examin it curiously. 

"and what is there special about it?" inquir mr. white as he took it 
from hi son, and have examin it, place it upon the table. 

"it had a spell put on it by an old fakir," said the sergeant-major, 
"a veri holi man. He want to show that fate rule people' lives, and 
that those who interf with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell 
on it so that three separ men could each have three wish from it." 

hi manner wa so impress that hi hearer were consciou that their 
light laughter jar somewhat. 

"well, whi don't you have three, sir?" said herbert white, cleverly. 

the soldier regard him in the way that middl age is wont to regard 
presumptu youth. "I have," he said, quietly, and hi blotchi face 
whitened. 

"and did you realli have the three wish granted?" ask mrs. white. 

"I did," said the sergeant-major, and hi glass tap against hi strong 
teeth. 

"and ha anybodi els wished?" persist the old lady. 

"the first man had hi three wishes. yes," wa the reply; "I don't know 
what the first two were, but the third wa for death. that' how I got 
the paw." 

hi tone were so grave that a hush fell upon the group. 

"if you'v had your three wishes, it' no good to you now, then, morris," 
said the old man at last. "what do you keep it for?" 

the soldier shook hi head. "fancy, I suppose," he said, slowly. "I did 
have some idea of sell it, but I don't think I will. It ha caus 
enough mischief already. besides, peopl won't buy. they think it' a 
fairi tale; some of them, and those who do think anyth of it want to 
tri it first and pay me afterward." 

"if you could have anoth three wishes," said the old man, eye him 
keenly, "would you have them?" 

"I don't know," said the other. "I don't know." 

He took the paw, and dangl it between hi forefing and thumb, 
suddenli threw it upon the fire. white, with a slight cry, stoop down 
and snatch it off. 

"better let it burn," said the soldier, solemnly. 

"if you don't want it, morris," said the other, "give it to me." 

"I won't," said hi friend, doggedly. "I threw it on the fire. If you 
keep it, don't blame me for what happens. pitch it on the fire again 
like a sensibl man." 

the other shook hi head and examin hi new possess closely. "how 
do you do it?" he inquired. 

"hold it up in your right hand and wish aloud," said the sergeant-major, 
"but I warn you of the consequences." 

"sound like the arabian nights," said mrs. white, as she rose and began 
to set the supper. "don't you think you might wish for four pair of 
hand for me?" 

her husband drew the talisman from pocket, and then all three burst into 
laughter as the sergeant-major, with a look of alarm on hi face, caught 
him by the arm. 

"if you must wish," he said, gruffly, "wish for someth sensible." 

mr. white drop it back in hi pocket, and place chairs, motion hi 
friend to the table. In the busi of supper the talisman wa partli 
forgotten, and afterward the three sat listen in an enthral fashion 
to a second instal of the soldier' adventur in india. 

"if the tale about the monkey' paw is not more truth than those he 
ha been tell us," said herbert, as the door close behind their 
guest, just in time for him to catch the last train, "we sha'nt make much 
out of it." 

"did you give him anyth for it, father?" inquir mrs. white, 
regard her husband closely. 

"A trifle," said he, colour slightly. "he didn't want it, but I made 
him take it. and he press me again to throw it away." 

"likely," said herbert, with pretend horror. "why, we'r go to be 
rich, and famou and happy. wish to be an emperor, father, to begin 
with; then you can't be henpecked." 

He dart round the table, pursu by the malign mrs. white arm with 
an antimacassar. 

mr. white took the paw from hi pocket and eye it dubiously. "I don't 
know what to wish for, and that' a fact," he said, slowly. "it seem to 
me i'v got all I want." 

"if you onli clear the house, you'd be quit happy, wouldn't you?" 
said herbert, with hi hand on hi shoulder. "well, wish for two hundr 
pounds, then; that 'll just do it." 

hi father, smile shamefacedli at hi own credulity, held up the 
talisman, as hi son, with a solemn face, somewhat mar by a wink at 
hi mother, sat down at the piano and struck a few impress chords. 

"I wish for two hundr pounds," said the old man distinctly. 

A fine crash from the piano greet the words, interrupt by a 
shudder cri from the old man. hi wife and son ran toward him. 

"it moved," he cried, with a glanc of disgust at the object as it lay on 
the floor. 

"a I wished, it twist in my hand like a snake." 

"well, I don't see the money," said hi son as he pick it up and place 
it on the table, "and I bet I never shall." 

"it must have been your fancy, father," said hi wife, regard him 
anxiously. 

He shook hi head. "never mind, though; there' no harm done, but it 
gave me a shock all the same." 

they sat down by the fire again while the two men finish their pipes. 
outside, the wind wa higher than ever, and the old man start nervous 
at the sound of a door bang upstairs. A silenc unusu and 
depress settl upon all three, which last until the old coupl rose 
to retir for the night. 

"I expect you'll find the cash tie up in a big bag in the middl of your 
bed," said herbert, as he bade them good-night, "and someth horribl 
squat up on top of the wardrob watch you as you pocket your 
ill-gotten gains." 

He sat alon in the darkness, gaze at the die fire, and see face 
in it. the last face wa so horribl and so simian that he gaze at it 
in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a littl uneasi laugh, he felt 
on the tabl for a glass contain a littl water to throw over it. hi 
hand grasp the monkey' paw, and with a littl shiver he wipe hi hand 
on hi coat and went up to bed. 



ii. 

In the bright of the wintri sun next morn as it stream over the 
breakfast tabl he laugh at hi fears. there wa an air of prosaic 
wholesom about the room which it had lack on the previou night, 
and the dirty, shrivel littl paw wa pitch on the sideboard with a 
careless which betoken no great belief in it virtues. 

"I suppos all old soldier are the same," said mrs. white. "the idea of 
our listen to such nonsense! how could wish be grant in these 
days? and if they could, how could two hundr pound hurt you, father?" 

"might drop on hi head from the sky," said the frivol herbert. 

"morri said the thing happen so naturally," said hi father, "that 
you might if you so wish attribut it to coincidence." 

"well, don't break into the money befor I come back," said herbert as he 
rose from the table. "i'm afraid it'll turn you into a mean, avarici 
man, and we shall have to disown you." 

hi mother laughed, and follow him to the door, watch him down the 
road; and return to the breakfast table, wa veri happi at the expens 
of her husband' credulity. all of which did not prevent her from 
scurri to the door at the postman' knock, nor prevent her from 
refer somewhat shortli to retir sergeant-major of bibul habit 
when she found that the post brought a tailor' bill. 

"herbert will have some more of hi funni remarks, I expect, when he 
come home," she said, as they sat at dinner. 

"I dare say," said mr. white, pour himself out some beer; "but for all 
that, the thing move in my hand; that i'll swear to." 

"you thought it did," said the old ladi soothingly. 

"I say it did," repli the other. "there wa no thought about it; I had 
just---- what' the matter?" 

hi wife made no reply. she wa watch the mysteri movement of a 
man outside, who, peer in an undecid fashion at the house, appear 
to be tri to make up hi mind to enter. In mental connect with the 
two hundr pounds, she notic that the stranger wa well dressed, and 
wore a silk hat of glossi newness. three time he paus at the gate, 
and then walk on again. the fourth time he stood with hi hand upon 
it, and then with sudden resolut flung it open and walk up the path. 
mrs. white at the same moment place her hand behind her, and hurriedli 
unfasten the string of her apron, put that use articl of apparel 
beneath the cushion of her chair. 

she brought the stranger, who seem ill at ease, into the room. He 
gaze at her furtively, and listen in a preoccupi fashion as the old 
ladi apolog for the appear of the room, and her husband' coat, a 
garment which he usual reserv for the garden. she then wait as 
patient as her sex would permit, for him to broach hi business, but he 
wa at first strang silent. 

"i--wa ask to call," he said at last, and stoop and pick a piec 
of cotton from hi trousers. "I come from 'maw and meggins.'" 

the old ladi started. "i anyth the matter?" she asked, 
breathlessly. "ha anyth happen to herbert? what is it? what is 
it?" 

her husband interposed. "there, there, mother," he said, hastily. "sit 
down, and don't jump to conclusions. you'v not brought bad news, i'm 
sure, sir;" and he eye the other wistfully. 

"i'm sorry--" began the visitor. 

"i he hurt?" demand the mother, wildly. 

the visitor bow in assent. "badli hurt," he said, quietly, "but he is 
not in ani pain." 

"oh, thank god!" said the old woman, clasp her hands. "thank god for 
that! thank--" 

she broke off suddenli as the sinist mean of the assur dawn 
upon her and she saw the aw confirm of her fear in the other' 
avert face. she caught her breath, and turn to her slower-wit 
husband, laid her trembl old hand upon his. there wa a long silence. 

"he wa caught in the machinery," said the visitor at length in a low 
voice. 

"caught in the machinery," repeat mr. white, in a daze fashion, "yes." 

He sat stare blankli out at the window, and take hi wife' hand 
between hi own, press it as he had been wont to do in their old 
courting-day nearli forti year before. 

"he wa the onli one left to us," he said, turn gentli to the visitor. 
"it is hard." 

the other coughed, and rising, walk slowli to the window. "the firm 
wish me to convey their sincer sympathi with you in your great loss," 
he said, without look round. "I beg that you will understand I am 
onli their servant and mere obey orders." 

there wa no reply; the old woman' face wa white, her eye staring, and 
her breath inaudible; on the husband' face wa a look such as hi friend 
the sergeant might have carri into hi first action. 

"I wa to say that 'maw and meggins' disclaim all responsibility," 
continu the other. "they admit no liabil at all, but in 
consider of your son' services, they wish to present you with 
a certain sum as compensation." 

mr. white drop hi wife' hand, and rise to hi feet, gaze with a 
look of horror at hi visitor. hi dri lip shape the words, "how 
much?" 

"two hundr pounds," wa the answer. 

unconsci of hi wife' shriek, the old man smile faintly, put out hi 
hand like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor. 


iii. 

In the huge new cemetery, some two mile distant, the old peopl buri 
their dead, and came back to a hous steep in shadow and silence. It 
wa all over so quickli that at first they could hardli realiz it, and 
remain in a state of expect as though of someth els to happen 
--someth els which wa to lighten thi load, too heavi for old heart 
to bear. 

but the day passed, and expect gave place to resignation--th 
hopeless resign of the old, sometim miscalled, apathy. sometim 
they hardli exchang a word, for now they had noth to talk about, and 
their day were long to weariness. 

It wa about a week after that the old man, wake suddenli in the night, 
stretch out hi hand and found himself alone. the room wa in 
darkness, and the sound of subdu weep came from the window. He 
rais himself in bed and listened. 

"come back," he said, tenderly. "you will be cold." 

"it is colder for my son," said the old woman, and wept afresh. 

the sound of her sob die away on hi ears. the bed wa warm, and hi 
eye heavi with sleep. He doze fitfully, and then slept until a sudden 
wild cri from hi wife awok him with a start. 

"the paw!" she cri wildly. "the monkey' paw!" 

He start up in alarm. "where? where is it? what' the matter?" 

she came stumbl across the room toward him. "I want it," she said, 
quietly. "you'v not destroy it?" 

"it' in the parlour, on the bracket," he replied, marvelling. "why?" 

she cri and laugh together, and bend over, kiss hi cheek. 

"I onli just thought of it," she said, hysterically. "whi didn't I think 
of it before? whi didn't you think of it?" 

"think of what?" he questioned. 

"the other two wishes," she replied, rapidly. "we'v onli had one." 

"wa not that enough?" he demanded, fiercely. 

"no," she cried, triumphantly; "we'll have one more. Go down and get it 
quickly, and wish our boy aliv again." 

the man sat up in bed and flung the bedcloth from hi quak limbs. 
"good god, you are mad!" he cried, aghast. 

"get it," she panted; "get it quickly, and wish--oh, my boy, my boy!" 

her husband struck a match and lit the candle. "get back to bed," he 
said, unsteadily. "you don't know what you are saying." 

"we had the first wish granted," said the old woman, feverishly; "whi not 
the second?" 

"A coincidence," stammer the old man. 

"go and get it and wish," cri hi wife, quiver with excitement. 

the old man turn and regard her, and hi voic shook. "he ha been 
dead ten days, and besid he--i would not tell you else, but--i could 
onli recogn him by hi clothing. If he wa too terribl for you to 
see then, how now?" 

"bring him back," cri the old woman, and drag him toward the door. 
"do you think I fear the child I have nursed?" 

He went down in the darkness, and felt hi way to the parlour, and then 
to the mantelpiece. the talisman wa in it place, and a horribl fear 
that the unspoken wish might bring hi mutil son befor him ere he 
could escap from the room seiz upon him, and he caught hi breath as 
he found that he had lost the direct of the door. hi brow cold with 
sweat, he felt hi way round the table, and grope along the wall until 
he found himself in the small passag with the unwholesom thing in hi 
hand. 

even hi wife' face seem chang as he enter the room. It wa white 
and expectant, and to hi fear seem to have an unnatur look upon it. 
He wa afraid of her. 

"wish!" she cried, in a strong voice. 

"it is foolish and wicked," he faltered. 

"wish!" repeat hi wife. 

He rais hi hand. "I wish my son aliv again." 

the talisman fell to the floor, and he regard it fearfully. then he 
sank trembl into a chair as the old woman, with burn eyes, walk 
to the window and rais the blind. 

He sat until he wa chill with the cold, glanc occasion at the 
figur of the old woman peer through the window. the candle-end, 
which had burn below the rim of the china candlestick, wa throw 
pulsat shadow on the ceil and walls, until, with a flicker larger 
than the rest, it expired. the old man, with an unspeak sens of 
relief at the failur of the talisman, crept back to hi bed, and a 
minut or two afterward the old woman came silent and apathet 
besid him. 

neither spoke, but lay silent listen to the tick of the clock. A 
stair creaked, and a squeaki mous scurri noisili through the wall. 
the dark wa oppressive, and after lie for some time screw up 
hi courage, he took the box of matches, and strike one, went 
downstair for a candle. 

At the foot of the stair the match went out, and he paus to strike 
another; and at the same moment a knock, so quiet and stealthi as to be 
scarc audible, sound on the front door. 

the match fell from hi hand and spill in the passage. He stood 
motionless, hi breath suspend until the knock wa repeated. then he 
turn and fled swiftli back to hi room, and close the door behind him. 
A third knock sound through the house. 

"what' that?" cri the old woman, start up. 

"A rat," said the old man in shake tones--"a rat. It pass me on the 
stairs." 

hi wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock resound through the 
house. 

"it' herbert!" she screamed. "it' herbert!" 

she ran to the door, but her husband wa befor her, and catch her by 
the arm, held her tightly. 

"what are you go to do?" he whisper hoarsely. 

"it' my boy; it' herbert!" she cried, struggl mechanically. 
"I forgot it wa two mile away. what are you hold me for? let go. 
I must open the door." 

"for god' sake don't let it in," cri the old man, trembling. 

"you'r afraid of your own son," she cried, struggling. "let me go. i'm 
coming, herbert; i'm coming." 

there wa anoth knock, and another. the old woman with a sudden wrench 
broke free and ran from the room. her husband follow to the landing, 
and call after her appealingli as she hurri downstairs. He heard the 
chain rattl back and the bottom bolt drawn slowli and stiffli from the 
socket. then the old woman' voice, strain and panting. 

"the bolt," she cried, loudly. "come down. I can't reach it." 

but her husband wa on hi hand and knee grope wildli on the floor in 
search of the paw. If he could onli find it befor the thing outsid got 
in. A perfect fusillad of knock reverber through the house, and he 
heard the scrape of a chair as hi wife put it down in the passag 
against the door. He heard the creak of the bolt as it came slowli 
back, and at the same moment he found the monkey' paw, and frantic 
breath hi third and last wish. 

the knock ceas suddenly, although the echo of it were still in the 
house. He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind 
rush up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappoint and 
miseri from hi wife gave him courag to run down to her side, and then 
to the gate beyond. the street lamp flicker opposit shone on a quiet 
and desert road.
