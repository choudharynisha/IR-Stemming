By W. W. jacob 




the well 

prefac 
two men stood in the billiard-room of an old countri house, talking. 
play, which had been of a half-heart nature, wa over, and they sat at 
the open window, look out over the park stretch away beneath them, 
convers idly. 

"your time' nearli up, jem," said one at length, "thi time six week 
you'll be yawn out the honeymoon and curs the man--woman I mean-- 
who invent them." 

jem benson stretch hi long limb in the chair and grunt in dissent. 

"i'v never understood it," continu wilfr carr, yawning. "it' not 
in my line at all; I never had enough money for my own wants, let alon 
for two. perhap if I were as rich as you or croesu I might regard it 
differently." 

there wa just suffici mean in the latter part of the remark for 
hi cousin to forbear to repli to it. He continu to gaze out of the 
window and to smoke slowly. 

"not be as rich as croesus--or you," resum carr, regard him from 
beneath lower lids, "I paddl my own cano down the stream of time, 
and, tie it to my friends' door-posts, go in to eat their dinners." 

"quit venetian," said jem benson, still look out of the window. 
"it' not a bad thing for you, wilfred, that you have the doorpost and 
dinners--and friends." 

carr grunt in hi turn. "serious though, jem," he said, slowly, 
"you'r a lucki fellow, a veri lucki fellow. If there is a better girl 
abov ground than olive, I should like to see her." 

"yes," said the other, quietly. 

"she' such an except girl," continu carr, stare out of the 
window. "she' so good and gentle. she think you are a bundl of all 
the virtues." 

He laugh frankli and joyously, but the other man did not join him. 
"strong sense--of right and wrong, though," continu carr, musingly. 
"do you know, I believ that if she found out that you were not----" 

"not what?" demand benson, turn upon him fiercely, "not what?" 

"everyth that you are," return hi cousin, with a grin that beli 
hi words, "I believ she'd drop you." 

"talk about someth else," said benson, slowly; "your pleasantri are 
not alway in the best taste." 

wilfr carr rose and take a cue from the rack, bent over the board and 
practic one or two favourit shots. "the onli other subject I can talk 
about just at present is my own financi affairs," he said slowly, as he 
walk round the table. 

"talk about someth else," said benson again, bluntly. 

"and the two thing are connected," said carr, and drop hi cue he 
half sat on the tabl and eye hi cousin. 

there wa a long silence. benson pitch the end of hi cigar out of the 
window, and lean back close hi eyes. 

"do you follow me?" inquir carr at length. 

benson open hi eye and nod at the window. 

"do you want to follow my cigar?" he demanded. 

"I should prefer to depart by the usual way for your sake," return the 
other, unabashed. "if I left by the window all sort of question would 
be asked, and you know what a talk chap I am." 

"so long as you don't talk about my affairs," return the other, 
restrain himself by an obviou effort, "you can talk yourself hoarse." 

"i'm in a mess," said carr, slowly, "a devil of a mess. If I don't rais 
fifteen hundr by thi day fortnight, I may be get my board and 
lodg free." 

"would that be ani change?" question benson. 

"the qualiti would," retort the other. "the address also would not be 
good. seriously, jem, will you let me have the fifteen hundred?" 

"no," said the other, simply. 

carr went white. "it' to save me from ruin," he said, thickly. 

"i'v help you till i'm tired," said benson, turn and regard him, 
"and it is all to no good. If you'v got into a mess, get out of it. 
you should not be so fond of give autograph away." 

"it' foolish, I admit," said carr, deliberately. "I won't do so ani 
more. By the way, i'v got some to sell. you needn't sneer. they'r 
not my own." 

"whose are they?" inquir the other. 

"yours." 

benson got up from hi chair and cross over to him. "what is this?" 
he asked, quietly. "blackmail?" 

"call it what you like," said carr. "i'v got some letter for sale, 
price fifteen hundred. and I know a man who would buy them at that price 
for the mere chanc of get oliv from you. i'll give you first 
offer." 

"if you have got ani letter bear my signature, you will be good 
enough to give them to me," said benson, veri slowly. 

"they'r mine," said carr, lightly; "given to me by the ladi you wrote 
them to. I must say that they are not all in the best possibl taste." 

hi cousin reach forward suddenly, and catch him by the collar of 
hi coat pin him down on the table. 

"give me those letters," he breathed, stick hi face close to carr's. 

"they'r not here," said carr, struggling. "i'm not a fool. let me go, 
or i'll rais the price." 

the other man rais him from the tabl in hi power hands, appar 
with the intent of dash hi head against it. then suddenli hi 
hold relax as an astonished-look maid-serv enter the room with 
letters. carr sat up hastily. 

"that' how it wa done," said benson, for the girl' benefit as he took 
the letters. 

"I don't wonder at the other man make him pay for it, then," said carr, 
blandly. 

"you will give me those letters?" said benson, suggestively, as the girl 
left the room. 

"at the price I mentioned, yes," said carr; "but so sure as I am a live 
man, if you lay your clumsi hand on me again, i'll doubl it. now, i'll 
leav you for a time while you think it over." 

He took a cigar from the box and light it care quit the room. 
hi cousin wait until the door had close behind him, and then turn 
to the window sat there in a fit of furi as silent as it wa terrible. 

the air wa fresh and sweet from the park, heavi with the scent of 
new-mown grass. the fragranc of a cigar wa now ad to it, and 
glanc out he saw hi cousin pace slowli by. He rose and went to the 
door, and then, appar alter hi mind, he return to the window 
and watch the figur of hi cousin as it move slowli away into the 
moonlight. then he rose again, and, for a long time, the room wa empty. 

* * * * * 

It wa empti when mrs. benson came in some time later to say good-night 
to her son on her way to bed. she walk slowli round the table, and 
paus at the window gaze from it in idl thought, until she saw the 
figur of her son advanc with rapid stride toward the house. He 
look up at the window. 

"good-night," said she. 

"good-night," said benson, in a deep voice. 

"where is wilfred?" 

"oh, he ha gone," said benson. 

"gone?" 

"we had a few words; he wa want money again, and I gave him a piec 
of my mind. I don't think we shall see him again." 

"poor wilfred!" sigh mrs. benson. "he is alway in troubl of some 
sort. I hope that you were not too hard upon him." 

"no more than he deserved," said her son, sternly. "good night." 


ii. 

the well, which had long ago fallen into disuse, wa almost hidden by the 
thick tangl of undergrowth which ran riot at that corner of the old 
park. It wa partli cover by the shrunken half of a lid, abov which a 
rusti windlass creak in compani with the music of the pine when the 
wind blew strongly. the full light of the sun never reach it, and the 
ground surround it wa moist and green when other part of the park 
were gape with the heat. 

two peopl walk slowli round the park in the fragrant still of a 
summer even stray in the direct of the well. 

"no use go through thi wilderness, olive," said benson, paus on 
the outskirt of the pine and eye with some disfavour the gloom 
beyond. 

"best part of the park," said the girl briskly; "you know it' my 
favourit spot." 

"I know you'r veri fond of sit on the coping," said the man slowly, 
"and I wish you wouldn't. one day you will lean back too far and fall 
in." 

"and make the acquaint of truth," said oliv lightly. "come along." 

she ran from him and wa lost in the shadow of the pines, the bracken 
crackl beneath her feet as she ran. her companion follow slowly, 
and emerg from the gloom saw her pois daintili on the edg of the 
well with her feet hidden in the rank grass and nettl which surround 
it. she motion her companion to take a seat by her side, and smile 
softli as she felt a strong arm pass about her waist. 

"I like thi place," said she, break a long silence, "it is so dismal 
--so uncanny. Do you know I wouldn't dare to sit here alone, jem. I 
should imagin that all sort of dread thing were hidden behind the 
bush and trees, wait to spring out on me. ugh!" 

"you'd better let me take you in," said her companion tenderly; "the well 
isn't alway wholesome, especi in the hot weather. 

"let' make a move." 

the girl gave an obstin littl shake, and settl herself more 
secur on her seat. 

"smoke your cigar in peace," she said quietly. "I am settl here for a 
quiet talk. ha anyth been heard of wilfr yet?" 

"nothing." 

"quit a dramat disappearance, isn't it?" she continued. "anoth 
scrape, I suppose, and anoth letter for you in the same old strain; 
'dear jem, help me out.'" 

jem benson blew a cloud of fragrant smoke into the air, and hold hi 
cigar between hi teeth brush away the ash from hi coat sleeves. 

"I wonder what he would have done without you," said the girl, press 
hi arm affectionately. "gone under long ago, I suppose. when we are 
married, jem, I shall presum upon the relationship to lectur him. He 
is veri wild, but he ha hi good points, poor fellow." 

"I never saw them," said benson, with startl bitterness. "god know I 
never saw them." 

"he is nobody' enemi but hi own," said the girl, startl by thi 
outburst. 

"you don't know much about him," said the other, sharply. "he wa not 
abov blackmail; not abov ruin the life of a friend to do himself a 
benefit. A loafer, a cur, and a liar!" 

the girl look up at him soberli but timidli and took hi arm without a 
word, and they both sat silent while even deepen into night and the 
beam of the moon, filter through the branches, surround them with a 
silver network. her head sank upon hi shoulder, till suddenli with a 
sharp cri she sprang to her feet. 

"what wa that?" she cri breathlessly. 

"what wa what?" demand benson, spring up and clutch her fast by 
the arm. 

she caught her breath and tri to laugh. 

"you'r hurt me, jem." 

hi hold relaxed. 

"what is the matter?" he ask gently. 

"what wa it startl you?" 

"I wa startled," she said, slowly, put her hand on hi shoulder. 
"I suppos the word I use just now are ring in my ears, but I 
fanci that somebodi behind us whisper 'jem, help me out.'" 

"fancy," repeat benson, and hi voic shook; "but these fanci are not 
good for you. you--ar frightened--at the dark and the gloom of these 
trees. let me take you back to the house." 

"no, i'm not frightened," said the girl, reseat herself. "I should 
never be realli frighten of anyth when you were with me, jem. i'm 
surpris at myself for be so silly." 

the man made no repli but stood, a strong, dark figure, a yard or two 
from the well, as though wait for her to join him. 

"come and sit down, sir," cri olive, pat the brickwork with her 
small, white hand, "one would think that you did not like your company." 

He obey slowli and took a seat by her side, draw so hard at hi 
cigar that the light of it shone upon hi fare at everi breath. He 
pass hi arm, firm and rigid as steel, behind her, with hi hand 
rest on the brickwork beyond. 

"are you warm enough?" he ask tenderly, as she made a littl movement. 
"pretti fair," she shivered; "one oughtn't to be cold at thi time of the 
year, but there' a cold, damp air come up from the well." 

As she spoke a faint splash sound from the depth below, and for the 
second time that evening, she sprang from the well with a littl cri of 
dismay. 

"what is it now?" he ask in a fear voice. He stood by her side and 
gaze at the well, as though half expect to see the caus of her alarm 
emerg from it. 

"oh, my bracelet," she cri in distress, "mi poor mother' bracelet. 
i'v drop it down the well." 

"your bracelet!" repeat benson, dully. "your bracelet? the diamond 
one?" 

"the one that wa my mother's," said olive. "oh, we can get it back 
surely. We must have the water drain off." 

"your bracelet!" repeat benson, stupidly. 

"jem," said the girl in terrifi tones, "dear jem, what is the matter?" 

for the man she love wa stand regard her with horror. the moon 
which touch it wa not respons for all the white of the 
distort face, and she shrank back in fear to the edg of the well. He 
saw her fear and by a mighti effort regain hi composur and took her 
hand. 

"poor littl girl," he murmured, "you frighten me. I wa not look 
when you cried, and I thought that you were slip from my arms, 
down--down--" 

hi voic broke, and the girl throw herself into hi arm clung to him 
convulsively. 

"there, there," said benson, fondly, "don't cry, don't cry." 

"to-morrow," said olive, half-laughing, half-crying, "we will all come 
round the well with hook and line and fish for it. It will be quit a 
new sport." 

"no, we must tri some other way," said benson. "you shall have it back." 

"how?" ask the girl. 

"you shall see," said benson. "to-morrow morn at latest you shall 
have it back. till then promis me that you will not mention your loss 
to anyone. promise." 

"I promise," said olive, wonderingly. "but whi not?" 

"it is of great value, for one thing, and--but there--ther are mani 
reasons. for one thing it is my duti to get it for you." 

"wouldn't you like to jump down for it?" she ask mischievously. 
"listen." 

she stoop for a stone and drop it down. 

"fanci be where that is now," she said, peer into the blackness; 
"fanci go round and round like a mous in a pail, clutch at the 
slimi sides, with the water fill your mouth, and look up to the 
littl patch of sky above." 

"you had better come in," said benson, veri quietly. "you are develop 
a tast for the morbid and horrible." 

the girl turned, and take hi arm walk slowli in the direct of the 
house; mrs. benson, who wa sit in the porch, rose to receiv them. 

"you shouldn't have kept her out so long," she said chidingly. "where 
have you been?" 

"sit on the well," said olive, smiling, "discuss our future." 

"I don't believ that place is healthy," said mrs. benson, emphatically. 
"I realli think it might be fill in, jem." 

"all right," said her son, slowly. "piti it wasn't fill in long ago." 

He took the chair vacat by hi mother as she enter the hous with 
olive, and with hi hand hang limpli over the side sat in deep 
thought. after a time he rose, and go upstair to a room which wa 
set apart for sport requisit select a sea fish line and some 
hook and stole softli downstair again. He walk swiftli across the 
park in the direct of the well, turn befor he enter the shadow 
of the tree to look back at the light window of the house. then 
have arrang hi line he sat on the edg of the well and cautious 
lower it. 

He sat with hi lip compressed, occasion look about him in a 
startl fashion, as though he half expect to see someth peer at 
him from the belt of trees. time after time he lower hi line until at 
length in pull it up he heard a littl metal tinkl against the 
side of the well. 

He held hi breath then, and forget hi fear drew the line in inch 
by inch, so as not to lose it preciou burden. hi puls beat rapidly, 
and hi eye were bright. As the line came slowli in he saw the catch 
hang to the hook, and with a steadi hand drew the last few feet in. 
then he saw that instead of the bracelet he had hook a bunch of keys. 

with a faint cri he shook them from the hook into the water below, and 
stood breath heavily. not a sound broke the still of the night. 
He walk up and down a bit and stretch hi great muscles; then he came 
back to the well and resum hi task. 

for an hour or more the line wa lower without result. In hi 
eager he forgot hi fears, and with eye bent down the well fish 
slowli and carefully. twice the hook becam entangl in something, and 
wa with difficulti released. It caught a third time, and all hi 
effort failed' to free it. then he drop the line down the well, 
and with head bent walk toward the house. 

He went first to the stabl at the rear, and then retir to hi room 
for some time pace restlessli up and down. then without remov hi 
cloth he flung himself upon the bed and fell into a troubl sleep. 


iii. 

long befor anybodi els wa astir he aros and stole softli downstairs. 
the sunlight wa steal in at everi crevice, and flash in long 
streak across the darken rooms. the dining-room into which he look 
struck chill and cheerless in the dark yellow light which came through 
the lower blinds. He rememb that it had the same appear when 
hi father lay dead in the house; now, as then, everyth seem ghastli 
and unreal; the veri chair stand as their occup had left them the 
night befor seem to be indulg in some dark commun of ideas. 

slowli and noiselessli he open the hall door and pass into the 
fragrant air beyond. the sun wa shine on the drench grass and 
trees, and a slowli vanish white mist roll like smoke about the 
grounds. for a moment he stood, breath deepli the sweet air of the 
morning, and then walk slowli in the direct of the stables. 

the rusti creak of a pump-handl and a spatter of water upon the 
red-til courtyard show that somebodi els wa astir, and a few step 
farther he beheld a brawny, sandy-hair man gasp wildli under sever 
self-inflict at the pump. 

"everyth ready, george?" he ask quietly. 

"yes, sir," said the man, straighten up suddenli and touch hi 
forehead. "bob' just finish the arrang inside. it' a love 
morn for a dip. the water in that well must be just icy." 

"be as quick as you can," said benson, impatiently. 

"veri good, sir," said george, burnish hi face harshli with a veri 
small towel which had been hang over the top of the pump. "hurri up, 
bob." 

In answer to hi summon a man appear at the door of the stabl with a 
coil of stout rope over hi arm and a larg metal candlestick in hi 
hand. 

"just to tri the air, sir," said george, follow hi master' glance, 
"a well get rather foul sometimes, but if a candl can live down it, a 
man can." 

hi master nodded, and the man, hastili pull up the neck of hi shirt 
and thrust hi arm into hi coat, follow him as he led the way 
slowli to the well. 

"beg pardon, sir," said george, draw up to hi side, "but you are not 
look over and abov well thi morning. If you'll let me go down i'd 
enjoy the bath." 

"no, no," said benson, peremptorily. 

"you ain't fit to go down, sir," persist hi follower. "i'v never 
seen you look so before. now if--" 

"mind your business," said hi master curtly. 

georg becam silent and the three walk with swing stride through 
the long wet grass to the well. bob flung the rope on the ground and at 
a sign from hi master hand him the candlestick. 

"here' the line for it, sir," said bob, fumbl in hi pockets. 

benson took it from him and slowli tie it to the candlestick. then he 
place it on the edg of the well, and strike a match, lit the candl 
and began slowli to lower it. 

"hold hard, sir," said george, quickly, lay hi hand on hi arm, "you 
must tilt it or the string'll burn through." 

even as he spoke the string part and the candlestick fell into the 
water below. 

benson swore quietly. 

"i'll soon get another," said george, start up. 

"never mind, the well' all right," said benson. 

"it won't take a moment, sir," said the other over hi shoulder. 

"are you master here, or am i?" said benson hoarsely. 

georg came back slowly, a glanc at hi master' face stop the 
protest upon hi tongue, and he stood by watch him sulkili as he sat 
on the well and remov hi outer garments. both men watch him 
curiously, as have complet hi prepar he stood grim and silent 
with hi hand by hi sides. 

"I wish you'd let me go, sir," said george, pluck up courag to 
address him. "you ain't fit to go, you'v got a chill or something. I 
shouldn't wonder it' the typhoid. they'v got it in the villag bad." 

for a moment benson look at him angrily, then hi gaze softened. "not 
thi time, george," he said, quietly. He took the loop end of the rope 
and place it under hi arms, and sit down threw one leg over the 
side of the well. 

"how are you go about it, sir?" queri george, lay hold of the 
rope and sign to bob to do the same. 

"i'll call out when I reach the water," said benson; "then pay out three 
yard more quickli so that I can get to the bottom." 

"veri good, sir," answer both. 

their master threw the other leg over the cope and sat motionless. hi 
back wa turn toward the men as he sat with head bent, look down the 
shaft. He sat for so long that georg becam uneasy. 

"all right, sir?" he inquired. 

"yes," said benson, slowly. "if I tug at the rope, george, pull up at 
once. lower away." 

the rope pass steadili through their hand until a hollow cri from the 
dark below and a faint splash warn them that he had reach the 
water. they gave him three yard more and stood with relax grasp and 
strain ears, waiting. 

"he' gone under," said bob in a low voice. 

the other nodded, and moisten hi huge palm took a firmer grip of the 
rope. 

fulli a minut passed, and the men began to exchang uneasi glances. 
then a sudden tremend jerk follow by a seri of feebler one nearli 
tore the rope from their grasp. 

"pull!" shout george, place one foot on the side and haul 
desperately. "pull! pull! he' stuck fast; he' not coming; pull!" 

In respons to their terrif exert the rope came slowli in, inch by 
inch, until at length a violent splash wa heard, and at the same 
moment a scream of unutter horror came echo up the shaft. 

"what a weight he is !" pant bob. "he' stuck fast or something. 
keep still, sir; for heaven' sake, keep still." 

for the taut rope wa be jerk violent by the struggl of the 
weight at the end of it. both men with grunt and sigh haul it in 
foot by foot. 

"all right, sir," cri george, cheerfully. 

He had one foot against the well, and wa pull manfully; the burden 
wa near the top. A long pull and a strong pull, and the face of a 
dead man with mud in the eye and nostril came peer over the edge. 
behind it wa the ghastli face of hi master; but thi he saw too late, 
for with a great cri he let go hi hold of the rope and step back. 
the sudden overthrew hi assistant, and the rope tore through hi 
hands. there wa a fright splash. 

"you fool!" stammer bob, and ran to the well helplessly. 

"run!" cri george. "run for anoth line." 

He bent over the cope and call eagerli down as hi assist sped 
back to the stabl shout wildly. hi voic re-echo down the shaft, 
but all els wa silence.
