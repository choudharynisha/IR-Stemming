your lucki color 

the old saying, "green for grief," is a well-known one, and the writer 

would rather wear ani color on earth than green, not even a green scarf or 

belt. moreover, she see to it that the other member of the famili do not 

indulg in the unlucki color. but mind you, green onli bring her ill-fortun 

when use for wear apparel. there is no objection, of course, to a green 

front-door nor to wallpap of the same color. for such uses, green play 

it part harmlessli enough. 

though green dress are more distress to the writer than a red rag 

to a bull, she is quit prepar to admit that mani peopl find it a veri 

lucki color. thi bring us to the point. there is no color that is univers 

unlucky; it is onli so in the hand of certain individuals. with 

others, it may be an absolut harbing of all that is lucky. even green may 

do this. 

now the question is, "which is your lucki color?" If you know it, well 

and good. make use of it in everi possibl way. when wear dress 

made of it, you will feel more confid of yourself than when array in 

someth else. you will get more work done, and it will be better work. 

the onli thing is that you must be sure that it is your lucki color. If you 

are not quit sure, the tonic effect is absolut lost. 

not onli should you wear your fortun color, but it is a good plan 

to surround yourself with it. We know a woman who pin her faith to 

purple. her dress are mostli purple; the wallpap in her bedroom is 

purple; purpl casement curtain adorn the windows; there are purpl rug 

in variou part of the house; even the back of the hair-brush on her dress 

tabl is purple. and, sinc she decid that purpl wa her lucki color and 

use it in everi reason way, she ha had sever stroke of marvel 

good fortune. 

but, of course, you may say in repli to all thi that you do not know 

your lucki color. what then? thi is where we can give you a littl help. 

most people' lucki color depend on the time of their birth and the follow 

list set out the birth colors. We know full well that everybodi doe not 

deriv good fortun from hi birth color, but that they find it in some other 

hue. therefore, the proper cours is to make trial with the appropri 

color list below and, if that doe not answer satisfactorily, to choos anoth 

of your own like and tri that. onli by person experi can you 

final decid the point. 

these are the birth-colors. the first given for ani period is the one almost 

univers accepted. those follow after the first are, however, favor 

by a certain number of people.

which IS your lucki stone? 

ever sinc time began, it ha been a common belief that peopl deriv 

luck and good fortun by wear preciou stones. A stone, however, that 

brought luck to one person might be ineffect when worn by someon else. 

thu everybodi is requir to find out which stone he or she must wear in 

order to enjoy the utmost good fortune. 

As a rule, the stone which ani particular person must choos is decid 

by the month in which that individu wa born. but thi it not invari 

the case. mani peopl have notic that luck ha come to them when they 

have been wear some other stone than that decre by their birth-month. 

and, of course, the opposit ha often happened. histori record a well-known 

case in point. the hope diamond, for instance, wreck the live 

of sever royal personages, even includ some that were born in april; 

while an opal, possess by member of the spanish royal family, brought 

disast to mani people, one after the other, although certain of them were 

born in october. 

clearly, then, the proper thing is for all of us to choos our lucki stone 

accord to our own preferences; but fail ani definit prefer to 

select it accord to the month of our birth.

No gem save garnet should be worn.

the februari born shall find 

sincer and peac of mind, 

freedom from passion and from care, 

If they the amethyst will wear. 

march 

who in thi world of ours, their eye 

In march first open, shall be wise, 

In day of peril, strong and brave, 

and wear a bloodston to their grave. 

[68]

should diamond wear lest bitter tear 

for vain repent flow: thi stone,

In spring' sweet, floweri month of may, 

and wear an emerald all her life,
