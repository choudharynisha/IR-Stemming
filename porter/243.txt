prefac 
"and what is it make you think I could be of use in thi particular 
case?" ask dr. john silence, look across somewhat sceptic at 
the swedish ladi in the chair face him. 

"your sympathet heart and your knowledg of occultism--" 

"oh, please--that dread word!" he interrupted, hold up a finger 
with a gestur of impatience. 

"well, then," she laughed, "your wonder clairvoy gift and your 
train psychic knowledg of the process by which a person may be 
disintegr and destroyed--thes strang studi you'v been 
experi with all these years--" 

"if it' onli a case of multipl person I must realli cri off," 
interrupt the doctor again hastily, a bore express in hi eyes. 

"it' not that; now, please, be serious, for I want your help," she 
said; "and if I choos my word poorli you must be patient with my 
ignorance. the case I know will interest you, and no one els could deal 
with it so well. In fact, no ordinari profession man could deal with 
it at all, for I know of no treatment nor medicin that can restor a 
lost sens of humour!" 

"you begin to interest me with your 'case,'" he replied, and made 
himself comfort to listen. 

mrs. sivendson drew a sigh of content as she watch him go to the 
tube and heard him tell the servant he wa not to be disturbed. 

"I believ you have read my thought already," she said; "your intuit 
knowledg of what goe on in other people' mind is posit 
uncanny." 

her friend shook hi head and smile as he drew hi chair up to a 
conveni posit and prepar to listen attent to what she had 
to say. He close hi eyes, as he alway did when he wish to absorb 
the real mean of a recit that might be inadequ expressed, for 
by thi method he found it easier to set himself in tune with the live 
thought that lay behind the broken words. 

By hi friend john silenc wa regard as an eccentric, becaus he wa 
rich by accident, and by choice--a doctor. that a man of independ 
mean should devot hi time to doctoring, chiefli doctor folk who 
could not pay, pass their comprehens entirely. the nativ nobil 
of a soul whose first desir wa to help those who could not help 
themselves, puzzl them. after that, it irrit them, and, greatli to 
hi own satisfaction, they left him to hi own devices. 

dr. silenc wa a free-lance, though, among doctors, have neither 
consulting-room, bookkeeper, nor profession manner. He took no fees, 
be at heart a genuin philanthropist, yet at the same time did no 
harm to hi fellow-practitioners, becaus he onli accept 
unremun cases, and case that interest him for some veri 
special reason. He argu that the rich could pay, and the veri poor 
could avail themselv of organis charity, but that a veri larg class 
of ill-paid, self-respect workers, often follow of the arts, could 
not afford the price of a week' comfort mere to be told to travel. 
and it wa these he desir to help: case often requir special and 
patient study--th no doctor can give for a guinea, and that no one 
would dream of expect him to give. 

but there wa anoth side to hi person and practice, and one with 
which we are now more directli concerned; for the case that especi 
appeal to him were of no ordinari kind, but rather of that intangible, 
elusive, and difficult natur best describ as psychic afflictions; 
and, though he would have been the last person himself to approv of the 
title, it wa beyond question that he wa known more or less gener 
as the "psychic doctor." 

In order to grappl with case of thi peculiar kind, he had submit 
himself to a long and sever training, at onc physical, mental, and 
spiritual. what precis thi train had been, or where undergone, no 
one seem to know,--for he never spoke of it, as, indeed, he betray 
no singl other characterist of the charlatan,--but the fact that it 
had involv a total disappear from the world for five years, and 
that after he return and began hi singular practic no one ever 
dream of appli to him the so easili acquir epithet of quack, 
spoke much for the serious of hi strang quest and also for the 
genuin of hi attainments. 

for the modern psychic research he felt the calm toler of the 
"man who knows." there wa a trace of piti in hi voice--contempt he 
never showed--when he spoke of their methods. 

"thi classif of result is uninspir work at best," he said 
onc to me, when I had been hi confidenti assist for some years. 
"it lead nowhere, and after a hundr year will lead nowhere. It is 
play with the wrong end of a rather danger toy. far better, it 
would be, to examin the causes, and then the result would so easili 
slip into place and explain themselves. for the sourc are accessible, 
and open to all who have the courag to lead the life that alon make 
practic investig safe and possible." 

and toward the question of clairvoyance, too, hi attitud wa 
significantli sane, for he knew how extrem rare the genuin power 
was, and that what is commonli call clairvoy is noth more than 
a keen power of visualising. 

"it connot a slightli increas sensibility, noth more," he would 
say. "the true clairvoy deplor hi power, recognis that it add 
a new horror to life, and is in the natur of an affliction. and you 
will find thi alway to be the real test." 

thu it wa that john silence, thi singularli develop doctor, wa 
abl to select hi case with a clear knowledg of the differ 
between mere hyster delus and the kind of psychic afflict 
that claim hi special powers. It wa never necessari for him to 
resort to the cheap mysteri of divination; for, as I have heard him 
observe, after the solut of some peculiarli intric problem-- 

"system of divination, from geomanc down to read by tea-leaves, are 
mere so mani method of obscur the outer vision, in order that the 
inner vision may becom open. onc the method is mastered, no system is 
necessari at all." 

and the word were signific of the method of thi remark man, 
the keynot of whose power lay, perhaps, more than anyth else, in the 
knowledge, first, that thought can act at a distance, and, secondly, 
that thought is dynam and can accomplish materi results. 

"learn how to _think_," he would have express it, "and you have 
learn to tap power at it source." 

To look at--h wa now past forty--h wa spare built, with speak 
brown eye in which shone the light of knowledg and self-confidence, 
while at the same time they made one think of that wondrou gentl 
seen most often in the eye of animals. A close beard conceal the 
mouth without disguis the grim determin of lip and jaw, and the 
face somehow convey an impress of transparency, almost of light, so 
delic were the featur refin away. On the fine forehead wa that 
indefin touch of peac that come from identifi the mind with 
what is perman in the soul, and let the imperman slip by 
without power to wound or distress; while, from hi manner,--so gentle, 
quiet, sympathetic,--few could have guess the strength of purpos that 
burn within like a great flame. 

"I think I should describ it as a psychic case," continu the 
swedish lady, obvious tri to explain herself veri intelligently, 
"and just the kind you like. I mean a case where the caus is hidden 
deep down in some spiritu distress, and--" 

"but the symptom first, please, my dear svenska," he interrupted, with 
a strang compel serious of manner, "and your deduct 
afterwards." 

she turn round sharpli on the edg of her chair and look him in the 
face, lower her voic to prevent her emot betray itself too 
obviously. 

"in my opinion there' onli one symptom," she half whispered, as though 
tell someth disagreeable--"fear--simpli fear." 

"physic fear?" 

"I think not; though how can I say? I think it' a horror in the 
psychic region. it' no ordinari delusion; the man is quit sane; but 
he live in mortal terror of something--" 

"I don't know what you mean by hi 'psychic region,'" said the doctor, 
with a smile; "though I suppos you wish me to understand that hi 
spiritual, and not hi mental, process are affected. anyhow, tri and 
tell me briefli and pointedli what you know about the man, hi symptoms, 
hi need for help, my peculiar help, that is, and all that seem vital 
in the case. I promis to listen devotedly." 

"I am trying," she continu earnestly, "but must do so in my own word 
and trust to your intellig to disentangl as I go along. He is a 
young author, and live in a tini hous off putney heath somewhere. He 
write humor stories--quit a genr of hi own: pender--y must have 
heard the name--felix pender? oh, the man had a great gift, and marri 
on the strength of it; hi futur seem assured. I say 'had,' for quit 
suddenli hi talent utterli fail him. worse, it becam transform 
into it opposite. He can no longer write a line in the old way that wa 
bring him success--" 

dr. silenc open hi eye for a second and look at her. 

"he still writes, then? the forc ha not gone?" he ask briefly, and 
then close hi eye again to listen. 

"he work like a fury," she went on, "but produc nothing"--sh 
hesit a moment--"noth that he can use or sell. hi earn have 
practic ceased, and he make a precari live by book-review 
and odd jobs--veri odd, some of them. yet, I am certain hi talent ha 
not realli desert him finally, but is merely--" 

again mrs. sivendson hesit for the appropri word. 

"in abeyance," he suggested, without open hi eyes. 

"obliterated," she went on, after a moment to weigh the word, "mere 
obliter by someth else--" 

"bi some one else?" 

"I wish I knew. all I can say is that he is haunted, and temporarili hi 
sens of humour is shrouded--gone--replac by someth dread that 
write other things. unless someth compet is done, he will simpli 
starv to death. yet he is afraid to go to a doctor for fear of be 
pronounc insane; and, anyhow, a man can hardli ask a doctor to take a 
guinea to restor a vanish sens of humour, can he?" 

"ha he tri ani one at all--?" 

"not doctor yet. He tri some clergymen and religi people; but they 
know so littl and have so littl intellig sympathy. and most of them 
are so busi balanc on their own littl pedestals--" 

john silenc stop her tirad with a gesture. 

"and how is it that you know so much about him?" he ask gently. 

"I know mrs. pender well--i knew her befor she marri him--" 

"and is she a cause, perhaps?" 

"not in the least. she is devoted; a woman veri well educated, though 
without be realli intelligent, and with so littl sens of humour 
herself that she alway laugh at the wrong places. but she ha noth 
to do with the caus of hi distress; and, indeed, ha chiefli guess 
it from observ him, rather than from what littl he ha told her. and 
he, you know, is a realli lovabl fellow, hard-working, 
patient--altogeth worth saving." 

dr. silenc open hi eye and went over to ring for tea. He did not 
know veri much more about the case of the humorist than when he first 
sat down to listen; but he realis that no amount of word from hi 
swedish friend would help to reveal the real facts. A person interview 
with the author himself could alon do that. 

"all humorist are worth saving," he said with a smile, as she pour 
out tea. "we can't afford to lose a singl one in these strenuou days. 
I will go and see your friend at the first opportunity." 

she thank him elaborately, effusively, with mani words, and he, with 
much difficulty, kept the convers thenceforward strictli to the 
teapot. 

and, as a result of thi conversation, and a littl more he had gather 
by mean best known to himself and hi secretary, he wa whizz in hi 
motor-car one afternoon a few day later up the putney hill to have hi 
first interview with felix pender, the humor writer who wa the 
victim of some mysteri maladi in hi "psychic region" that had 
obliter hi sens of the comic and threaten to wreck hi life and 
destroy hi talent. and hi desir to help wa probabl of equal 
strength with hi desir to know and to investigate. 

the motor stop with a deep pur sound, as though a great black 
panther lay conceal within it hood, and the doctor--th "psychic 
doctor," as he wa sometim called--step out through the gather 
fog, and walk across the tini garden that held a blacken fir tree 
and a stunt laurel shrubbery. the hous wa veri small, and it wa 
some time befor ani one answer the bell. then, suddenly, a light 
appear in the hall, and he saw a pretti littl woman stand on the 
top step beg him to come in. she wa dress in grey, and the 
gaslight fell on a mass of deliber brush light hair. stuffed, 
dusti birds, and a shabbi array of african spears, hung on the wall 
behind her. A hat-rack, with a bronz plate full of veri larg cards, 
led hi eye swiftli to a dark staircas beyond. mrs. pender had round 
eye like a child's, and she greet him with an effus that 
bare conceal her emotion, yet strove to appear natur cordial. 
evid she had been look out for hi arrival, and had outrun the 
servant girl. she wa a littl breathless. 

"I hope you'v not been kept waiting--i think it' _most_ good of you to 
come--" she began, and then stop sharp when she saw hi face in the 
gaslight. there wa someth in dr. silence' look that did not 
encourag mere talk. He wa in earnest now, if ever man was. 

"good evening, mrs. pender," he said, with a quiet smile that won 
confidence, yet deprec unnecessari words, "the fog delay me a 
little. I am glad to see you." 

they went into a dingi sitting-room at the back of the house, neatli 
furnish but depressing. book stood in a row upon the mantelpiece. the 
fire had evid just been lit. It smoke in great puff into the 
room. 

"mrs. sivendson said she thought you might be abl to come," ventur 
the littl woman again, look up engagingli into hi face and 
betray anxieti and eager in everi gesture. "but I hardli dare to 
believ it. I think it is realli too good of you. My husband' case is 
so peculiar that--well, you know, I am quit sure ani _ordinary_ doctor 
would say at onc the asylum--" 

"isn't he in, then?" ask dr. silenc gently. 

"in the asylum?" she gasped. "oh dear, no--not yet!" 

"in the house, I meant," he laughed. 

she gave a great sigh. 

"he'll be back ani minut now," she replied, obvious reliev to see 
him laugh; "but the fact is, we didn't expect you so early--i mean, my 
husband hardli thought you would come at all." 

"I am alway delight to come--when I am realli wanted, and can be of 
help," he said quickly; "and, perhaps, it' all for the best that your 
husband is out, for now that we are alon you can tell me someth 
about hi difficulties. So far, you know, I have heard veri little." 

her voic trembl as she thank him, and when he came and took a chair 
close besid her she actual had difficulti in find word with which 
to begin. 

"in the first place," she began timidly, and then continu with a 
nervou incoher rush of words, "he will be simpli delight that 
you'v realli come, becaus he said you were the onli person he would 
consent to see at all--th onli doctor, I mean. but, of course, he 
doesn't know how frighten I am, or how much I have noticed. He 
pretend with me that it' just a nervou breakdown, and i'm sure he 
doesn't realis all the odd thing i'v notic him doing. but the main 
thing, I suppose--" 

"yes, the main thing, mrs. pender," he said, encouragingly, notic her 
hesitation. 

"--i that he think we are not alon in the house. that' the chief 
thing." 

"tell me more facts--just facts." 

"it began last summer when I came back from ireland; he had been here 
alon for six weeks, and I thought him look tire and queer--rag 
and scatter about the face, if you know what I mean, and hi manner 
worn out. He said he had been write hard, but hi inspir had 
somehow fail him, and he wa dissatisfi with hi work. hi sens of 
humour wa leav him, or chang into someth else, he said. there 
wa someth in the house, he declared, that"--sh emphasis the 
words--"prev hi feel funny." 

"someth in the hous that prevent hi feel funny," repeat the 
doctor. "ah, now we'r get to the heart of it!" 

"yes," she resum vaguely, "that' what he kept saying." 

"and what wa it he _did_ that you thought strange?" he ask 
sympathetically. "be brief, or he may be here befor you finish." 

"veri small things, but signific it seem to me. He chang hi 
workroom from the library, as we call it, to the sitting-room. He said 
all hi charact becam wrong and terribl in the library; they 
altered, so that he felt like write tragedies--vile, debas 
tragedies, the tragedi of broken souls. but now he say the same of 
the sitting-room, and he' gone back to the library." 

"ah!" 

"you see, there' so littl I can tell you," she went on, with 
increas speed and countless gestures. "I mean it' onli veri small 
thing he doe and say that are queer. what frighten me is that he 
assum there is some one els in the hous all the time--som one I 
never see. He doe not actual say so, but on the stair i'v seen him 
stand asid to let some one pass; i'v seen him open a door to let 
some one in or out; and often in our bedroom he put chair about as 
though for some one els to sit in. oh--oh yes, and onc or twice," she 
cried--"onc or twice--" 

she paused, and look about her with a startl air. 

"yes?" 

"onc or twice," she resum hurriedly, as though she heard a sound that 
alarm her, "i'v heard him running--com in and out of the room 
breathless as if someth were after him--" 

the door open while she wa still speaking, cut her word off in 
the middle, and a man came into the room. He wa dark and clean-shaven, 
sallow rather, with the eye of imagination, and dark hair grow 
scantili about the temples. He wa dress in a shabbi tweed suit, and 
wore an untidi flannel collar at the neck. the domin express of 
hi face wa startled--hunted; an express that might ani moment leap 
into the dread stare of terror and announc a total loss of 
self-control. 

the moment he saw hi visitor a smile spread over hi worn features, and 
he advanc to shake hands. 

"I hope you would come; mrs. sivendson said you might be abl to find 
time," he said simply. hi voic wa thin and needy. "I am veri glad to 
see you, dr. silence. It is 'doctor,' is it not?" 

"well, I am entitl to the description," laugh the other, "but I 
rare get it. you know, I do not practis as a regular thing; that is, 
I onli take case that special interest me, or--" 

He did not finish the sentence, for the men exchang a glanc of 
sympathi that render it unnecessary. 

"I have heard of your great kindness." 

"it' my hobby," said the other quickly, "and my privilege." 

"I trust you will still think so when you have heard what I have to tell 
you," continu the author, a littl wearily. He led the way across the 
hall into the littl smoking-room where they could talk freeli and 
undisturbed. 

In the smoking-room, the door shut and privaci about them, fender' 
attitud chang somewhat, and hi manner becam veri grave. the doctor 
sat opposite, where he could watch hi face. already, he saw, it look 
more haggard. evid it cost him much to refer to hi troubl at all. 

"what I have is, in my belief, a profound spiritu affliction," he 
began quit bluntly, look straight into the other' eyes. 

"I saw that at once," dr. silenc said. 

"yes, you saw that, of course; my atmospher must convey that much to 
ani one with psychic perceptions. besid which, I feel sure from all 
i'v heard, that you are realli a soul-doctor, are you not, more than a 
healer mere of the body?" 

"you think of me too highly," return the other; "though I prefer 
cases, as you know, in which the spirit is disturb first, the bodi 
afterwards." 

"I understand, yes. well, I have experienc a curiou disturb 
in--not in my physic region primarily. I mean my nerv are all right, 
and my bodi is all right. I have no delus exactly, but my spirit is 
tortur by a calamit fear which first came upon me in a strang 
manner." 

john silenc lean forward a moment and took the speaker' hand and 
held it in hi own for a few brief seconds, close hi eye as he did 
so. He wa not feel hi pulse, or do ani of the thing that 
doctor ordinarili do; he wa mere absorb into himself the main 
note of the man' mental condition, so as to get complet hi own 
point of view, and thu be abl to treat hi case with true sympathy. A 
veri close observ might perhap have notic that a slight tremor ran 
through hi frame after he had held the hand for a few seconds. 

"tell me quit frankly, mr. pender," he said soothingly, releas the 
hand, and with deep attent in hi manner, "tell me all the step that 
led to the begin of thi invasion. I mean tell me what the 
particular drug was, and whi you took it, and how it affect you--" 

"then you know it began with a drug!" cri the author, with undisguis 
astonishment. 

"I onli know from what I observ in you, and in it effect upon myself. 
you are in a surpris psychic condition. certain portion of your 
atmospher are vibrat at a far greater rate than others. thi is the 
effect of a drug, but of no ordinari drug. allow me to finish, please. 
If the higher rate of vibrat spread all over, you will become, of 
course, perman cognis of a much larger world than the one you 
know normally. if, on the other hand, the rapid portion sink back to 
the usual rate, you will lose these occasion increas percept you 
now have." 

"you amaz me!" exclaim the author; "for your word exactli describ 
what I have been feeling--" 

"I mention thi onli in passing, and to give you confid befor you 
approach the account of your real affliction," continu the doctor. 
"all perception, as you know, is the result of vibrations; and 
clairvoy simpli mean becom sensit to an increas scale of 
vibrations. the awaken of the inner sens we hear so much about 
mean no more than that. your partial clairvoy is easili explained. 
the onli thing that puzzl me is how you manag to procur the drug, 
for it is not easi to get in pure form, and no adulter tinctur 
could have given you the terrif impetu I see you have acquired. but, 
pleas proceed now and tell me your stori in your own way." 

"thi _cannabi indica_," the author went on, "came into my possess 
last autumn while my wife wa away. I need not explain how I got it, for 
that ha no importance; but it wa the genuin fluid extract, and I could 
not resist the temptat to make an experiment. one of it effects, as 
you know, is to induc torrenti laughter--" 

"yes: sometimes." 

"--i am a writer of humor tales, and I wish to increas my own 
sens of laughter--to see the ludicr from an abnorm point of view. 
I wish to studi it a bit, if possible, and--" 

"tell me!" 

"I took an experiment dose. I starv for six hour to hasten the 
effect, lock myself into thi room, and gave order not to be 
disturbed. then I swallow the stuff and waited." 

"and the effect?" 

"I wait one hour, two, three, four, five hours. noth happened. No 
laughter came, but onli a great weari instead. noth in the room 
or in my thought came within a hundr mile of a humor aspect." 

"alway a most uncertain drug," interrupt the doctor. "we make veri 
small use of it on that account." 

"at two o'clock in the morn I felt so hungri and tire that I decid 
to give up the experi and wait no longer. I drank some milk and went 
upstair to bed. I felt flat and disappointed. I fell asleep at onc and 
must have slept for about an hour, when I awok suddenli with a great 
nois in my ears. It wa the nois of my own laughter! I wa simpli 
shake with merriment. At first I wa bewild and thought I had been 
laugh in dreams, but a moment later I rememb the drug, and wa 
delight to think that after all I had got an effect. It had been 
work all along, onli I had miscalcul the time. the onli 
unpleas thing _then_ wa an odd feel that I had not wake 
naturally, but had been waken by some one else--deliberately. thi 
came to me as a certainti in the middl of my noisi laughter and 
distress me." 

"ani impress who it could have been?" ask the doctor, now listen 
with close attent to everi word, veri much on the alert. 

pender hesit and tri to smile. He brush hi hair from hi 
forehead with a nervou gesture. 

"you must tell me all your impressions, even your fancies; they are 
quit as import as your certainties." 

"I had a vagu idea that it wa some one connect with my forgotten 
dream, some one who had been at me in my sleep, some one of great 
strength and great ability--of great force--quit an unusu 
personality--and, I wa certain, too--a woman." 

"A good woman?" ask john silenc quietly. 

pender start a littl at the question and hi sallow face flushed; it 
seem to surpris him. but he shook hi head quickli with an 
indefin look of horror. 

"evil," he answer briefly, "appallingli evil, and yet mingl with the 
sheer wicked of it wa also a certain perverseness--th pervers 
of the unbalanc mind." 

He hesit a moment and look up sharpli at hi interlocutor. A shade 
of suspicion show itself in hi eyes. 

"no," laugh the doctor, "you need not fear that i'm mere humour 
you, or think you mad. far from it. your stori interest me exceedingli 
and you furnish me unconsci with a number of clue as you tell it. 
you see, I possess some knowledg of my own as to these psychic byways." 

"I wa shake with such violent laughter," continu the narrator, 
reassur in a moment, "though with no clear idea what wa amus me, 
that I had the greatest difficulti in get up for the matches, and 
wa afraid I should frighten the servant overhead with my explosions. 
when the ga wa lit I found the room empty, of course, and the door 
lock as usual. then I half dress and went out on to the landing, my 
hilar better under control, and proceed to go downstairs. I wish 
to record my sensations. I stuf a handkerchief into my mouth so as 
not to scream aloud and commun my hyster to the entir 
household." 

"and the presenc of this--this--?" 

"it wa hang about me all the time," said pender, "but for the moment 
it seem to have withdrawn. probably, too, my laughter kill all other 
emotions." 

"and how long did you take get downstairs?" 

"I wa just come to that. I see you know all my 'symptoms' in advance, 
as it were; for, of course, I thought I should never get to the bottom. 
each step seem to take five minutes, and cross the narrow hall at 
the foot of the stairs--well, I could have sworn it wa half an hour' 
journey had not my watch certifi that it wa a few seconds. yet I 
walk fast and tri to push on. It wa no good. I walk appar 
without advancing, and at that rate it would have taken me a week to get 
down putney hill." 

"an experiment dose radic alter the scale of time and space 
sometimes--" 

"but, when at last I got into my studi and lit the gas, the chang came 
horridly, and sudden as a flash of lightning. It wa like a douch of 
ici water, and in the middl of thi storm of laughter--" 

"yes; what?" ask the doctor, lean forward and peer into hi 
eyes. 

"--i wa overwhelm with terror," said pender, lower hi reedi 
voic at the mere recollect of it. 

He paus a moment and mop hi forehead. the scared, hunt look in 
hi eye now domin the whole face. yet, all the time, the corner of 
hi mouth hint of possibl laughter as though the recollect of that 
merriment still amus him. the combin of fear and laughter in hi 
face wa veri curious, and lent great convict to hi story; it also 
lent a bizarr express of horror to hi gestures. 

"terror, wa it?" repeat the doctor soothingly. 

"yes, terror; for, though the thing that woke me seem to have gone, 
the memori of it still frighten me, and I collaps into a chair. then 
I lock the door and tri to reason with myself, but the drug made my 
movement so prolong that it took me five minut to reach the door, 
and anoth five to get back to the chair again. the laughter, too, kept 
bubbl up insid me--great wholesom laughter that shook me like gust 
of wind--so that even my terror almost made me laugh. oh, but I may tell 
you, dr. silence, it wa altogeth vile, that mixtur of fear and 
laughter, altogeth vile! 

"then, all at once, the thing in the room again present their funni 
side to me and set me off laugh more furious than ever. the 
bookcas wa ludicrous, the arm-chair a perfect clown, the way the clock 
look at me on the mantelpiec too comic for words; the arrang of 
paper and inkstand on the desk tickl me till I roar and shook and 
held my side and the tear stream down my cheeks. and that footstool! 
oh, that absurd footstool!" 

He lay back in hi chair, laugh to himself and hold up hi hand 
at the thought of it, and at the sight of him dr. silenc laughed, too. 

"go on, please," he said, "I quit understand. I know someth myself 
of the hashish laughter." 

the author pull himself togeth and resumed, hi face grow quickli 
grave again. 

"so, you see, side by side with thi extravagant, appar causeless 
merriment, there wa also an extravagant, appar causeless terror. 
the drug produc the laughter, I knew; but what brought in the terror I 
could not imagine. everywher behind the fun lay the fear. It wa terror 
mask by cap and bells; and I becam the playground for two oppos 
emotions, arm and fight to the death. gradually, then, the 
impress grew in me that thi fear wa caus by the invasion--so you 
call it just now--of the 'person' who had waken me: she wa utterli 
evil; inim to my soul, or at least to all in me that wish for 
good. there I stood, sweat and trembling, laugh at everyth in 
the room, yet all the while with thi white terror master my heart. 
and thi creatur wa putting--put her--" 

He hesit again, use hi handkerchief freely. 

"put what?" 

"--put idea into my mind," he went on glanc nervous about the 
room. "actual tap my thought-stream so as to switch off the usual 
current and inject her own. how mad that sounds! I know it, but it' 
true. it' the onli way I can express it. moreover, while the oper 
terrifi me, the skill with which it wa accomplish fill me afresh 
with laughter at the clumsi of men by comparison. our ignorant, 
bungl method of teach the mind of others, of inculc ideas, 
and so on, overwhelm me with laughter when I understood thi superior 
and diabol method. yet my laughter seem hollow and ghastly, and 
idea of evil and tragedi trod close upon the heel of the comic. oh, 
doctor, I tell you again, it wa unnerving!" 

john silenc sat with hi head thrust forward to catch everi word of the 
stori which the other continu to pour out in nervous, jerki sentenc 
and lower voice. 

"you saw nothing--no one--al thi time?" he asked. 

"not with my eyes. there wa no visual hallucination. but in my mind 
there began to grow the vivid pictur of a woman--large, dark-skinned, 
with white teeth and masculin features, and one eye--th left--so 
droop as to appear almost closed. oh, such a face--!" 

"A face you would recognis again?" 

pender laugh dreadfully. 

"I wish I could forget it," he whispered, "I onli wish I could forget 
it!" then he sat forward in hi chair suddenly, and grasp the doctor' 
hand with an emot gesture. 

"I _must_ tell you how grate I am for your patienc and sympathy," he 
cried, with a tremor in hi voice, "and--that you do not think me mad. I 
have told no one els a quarter of all this, and the mere freedom of 
speech--th relief of share my afflict with another--ha help me 
alreadi more than I can possibl say." 

dr. silenc press hi hand and look steadili into the frighten 
eyes. hi voic wa veri gentl when he replied. 

"your case, you know, is veri singular, but of absorb interest to 
me," he said, "for it threatens, not your physic exist but the 
templ of your psychic existence--th inner life. your mind would 
not be perman affect here and now, in thi world; but in the 
exist after the bodi is left behind, you might wake up with your 
spirit so twisted, so distorted, so befouled, that you would be 
_spiritu insane_--a far more radic condit than mere be 
insan here." 

there came a strang hush over the room, and between the two men sit 
there face one another. 

"do you realli mean--good lord!" stammer the author as soon as he 
could find hi tongue. 

"what I mean in detail will keep till a littl later, and I need onli 
say now that I should not have spoken in thi way unless I were quit 
posit of be abl to help you. oh, there' no doubt as to that, 
believ me. In the first place, I am veri familiar with the work of 
thi extraordinari drug, thi drug which ha had the chanc effect of 
open you up to the forc of anoth region; and, in the second, I 
have a firm belief in the realiti of supersensu occurr as well 
as consider knowledg of psychic process acquir by long and 
pain experiment. the rest is, or should be, mere sympathet 
treatment and practic application. the hashish ha partial open 
anoth world to you by increas your rate of psychic vibration, and 
thu render you abnorm sensitive. ancient forc attach to thi 
hous have attack you. for the moment I am onli puzzl as to their 
precis nature; for were they of an ordinari character, I should myself 
be psychic enough to feel them. yet I am consciou of feel noth as 
yet. but now, pleas continue, mr. pender, and tell me the rest of your 
wonder story; and when you have finished, I will talk about the mean 
of cure." 

pender shift hi chair a littl closer to the friendli doctor and then 
went on in the same nervou voic with hi narrative. 

"after make some note of my impress I final got upstair again 
to bed. It wa four o'clock in the morning. I laugh all the way up--at 
the grotesqu banisters, the droll physiognomi of the staircas window, 
the burlesqu group of the furniture, and the memori of that 
outrag footstool in the room below; but noth more happen to 
alarm or disturb me, and I woke late in the morn after a dreamless 
sleep, none the wors for my experi except for a slight headach and 
a cold of the extrem due to lower circulation." 

"fear gone, too?" ask the doctor. 

"I seem to have forgotten it, or at least ascrib it to mere 
nervousness. it realiti had gone, anyhow for the time, and all that day 
I wrote and wrote and wrote. My sens of laughter seem wonder 
quicken and my charact act without effort out of the heart of 
true humour. I wa exceedingli pleas with thi result of my 
experiment. but when the stenograph had taken her departur and I came 
to read over the page she had type out, I recal her sudden glanc 
of surpris and the odd way she had look up at me while I wa 
dictating. I wa amaz at what I read and could hardli believ I had 
utter it." 

"and why?" 

"it wa so distorted. the words, indeed, were mine so far as I could 
remember, but the mean seem strange. It frighten me. the sens 
wa so altered. At the veri place where my charact were intend to 
tickl the ribs, onli curiou emot of sinist amus resulted. 
dread innuendo had manag to creep into the phrases. there wa 
laughter of a kind, but it wa bizarre, horrible, distressing; and my 
attempt at analysi onli increas my dismay. the story, as it read 
then, made me shudder, for by virtu of these slight chang it had come 
somehow to hold the soul of horror, of horror disguis as merriment. 
the framework of humour wa there, if you understand me, but the 
charact had turn sinister, and their laughter wa evil." 

"can you show me thi writing?" 

the author shook hi head. 

"I destroy it," he whispered. "but, in the end, though of cours much 
perturb about it, I persuad myself that it wa due to some 
after-effect of the drug, a sort of reaction that gave a twist to my 
mind and made me read macabr interpret into word and situat 
that did not properli hold them." 

"and, meanwhile, did the presenc of thi person leav you?" 

"no; that stay more or less. when my mind wa activ employ I 
forgot it, but when idle, dreaming, or do noth in particular, 
there she wa besid me, influenc my mind horribly--" 

"in what way, precisely?" interrupt the doctor. 

"evil, scheme thought came to me, vision of crime, hate pictur 
of wickedness, and the kind of bad imagin that so far ha been 
foreign, inde impossible, to my normal nature--" 

"the pressur of the dark power upon the personality," murmur the 
doctor, make a quick note. 

"eh? I didn't quit catch--" 

"pray, go on. I am mere make notes; you shall know their purport 
fulli later." 

"even when my wife return I wa still awar of thi presenc in the 
house; it associ itself with my inner person in most intim 
fashion; and outwardli I alway felt oddli constrain to be polit and 
respect toward it--to open doors, provid chair and hold myself 
care deferenti when it wa about. It becam veri compel at 
last, and, if I fail in ani littl particular, I seem to know that 
it pursu me about the house, from one room to another, haunt my 
veri soul in it inmost abode. It certainli came befor my wife so far 
as my attent were concerned. 

"but, let me first finish the stori of my experiment dose, for I took 
it again the third night, and underw a veri similar experience, 
delay like the first in coming, and then carri me off my feet when 
it did come with a rush of thi fals demon-laughter. thi time, 
however, there wa a revers of the chang scale of space and time; it 
shorten instead of lengthened, so that I dress and got downstair in 
about twenti seconds, and the coupl of hour I stay and work in the 
studi pass liter like a period of ten minutes." 

"that is often true of an overdose," interject the doctor, "and you 
may go a mile in a few minutes, or a few yard in a quarter of an hour. 
It is quit incomprehens to those who have never experienc it, and 
is a curiou proof that time and space are mere form of thought." 

"thi time," pender went on, talk more and more rapidli in hi 
excitement, "anoth extraordinari effect came to me, and I experienc 
a curiou chang of the senses, so that I perceiv extern thing 
through one larg main sense-channel instead of through the five 
divis known as sight, smell, touch, and so forth. you will, I know, 
understand me when I tell you that I _heard_ sight and _saw_ sounds. No 
languag can make thi comprehensible, of course, and I can onli say, 
for instance, that the strike of the clock I saw as a visibl pictur 
in the air befor me. I saw the sound of the tinkl bell. and in 
precis the same way I heard the colour in the room, especi the 
colour of those book in the shelf behind you. those red bind I 
heard in deep sounds, and the yellow cover of the french bind next 
to them made a shrill, pierc note not unlik the chatter of 
starlings. that brown bookcas muttered, and those green curtain 
opposit kept up a constant sort of rippl sound like the lower note 
of a wood-horn. but I onli wa consciou of these sound when I look 
steadili at the differ objects, and thought about them. the room, you 
understand, wa not full of a choru of notes; but when I concentr 
my mind upon a colour, I heard, as well as saw, it." 

"that is a known, though rare obtained, effect of _cannabi indica_," 
observ the doctor. "and it provok laughter again, did it?" 

"onli the mutter of the cupboard-bookcas made me laugh. It wa so 
like a great anim tri to get itself noticed, and made me think of a 
perform bear--which is full of a kind of pathet humour, you know. 
but thi mingl of the sens produc no confus in my brain. On 
the contrary, I wa unusu clear-head and experienc an 
intensif of consciousness, and felt marvel aliv and 
keen-minded. 

"moreover, when I took up a pencil in obedi to an impuls to 
sketch--a talent not normal mine--i found that I could draw noth 
but heads, nothing, in fact, but one head--alway the same--th head of 
a dark-skin woman, with huge and terribl featur and a veri 
droop left eye; and so well drawn, too, that I wa amazed, as you may 
imagine--" 

"and the express of the face--?" 

pender hesit a moment for words, cast about with hi hand in the 
air and hunch hi shoulders. A percept shudder ran over him. 

"what I can onli describ as--_blackness_," he repli in a low tone; 
"the face of a dark and evil soul." 

"you destroy that, too?" queri the doctor sharply. 

"no; I have kept the drawings," he said, with a laugh, and rose to get 
them from a drawer in the writing-desk behind him. 

"here is all that remain of the pictures, you see," he added, push a 
number of loos sheet under the doctor' eyes; "noth but a few 
scrawli lines. that' all I found the next morning. I had realli drawn 
no head at all--noth but those line and blot and wriggles. the 
pictur were entir subjective, and exist onli in my mind which 
construct them out of a few wild stroke of the pen. like the alter 
scale of space and time it wa a complet delusion. these all passed, of 
course, with the pass of the drug' effects. but the other thing did 
not pass. I mean, the presenc of that dark soul remain with me. It is 
here still. It is real. I don't know how I can escap from it." 

"it is attach to the house, not to you personally. you must leav the 
house." 

"yes. onli I cannot afford to leav the house, for my work is my sole 
mean of support, and--well, you see, sinc thi chang I cannot even 
write. they are horrible, these mirthless tale I now write, with their 
mockeri of laughter, their diabol suggestion. horrible? I shall go 
mad if thi continues." 

He screw hi face up and look about the room as though he expect 
to see some haunt shape. 

"thi influenc in thi hous induc by my experiment, ha kill in a 
flash, in a sudden stroke, the sourc of my humour, and though I still 
go on write funni tales--i have a certain name you know--mi 
inspir ha dri up, and much of what I write I have to burn--yes, 
doctor, to burn, befor ani one see it." 

"a utterli alien to your own mind and personality?" 

"utterly! As though some one els had written it--" 

"ah!" 

"and shocking!" He pass hi hand over hi eye a moment and let the 
breath escap softli through hi teeth. "yet most damnabl clever in the 
consumm way the vile suggest are insinu under cover of a kind 
of high drollery. My stenograph left me of course--and i'v been 
afraid to take another--" 

john silenc got up and began to walk about the room leisur without 
speaking; he appear to be examin the pictur on the wall and 
read the name of the book lie about. present he paus on the 
hearthrug, with hi back to the fire, and turn to look hi patient 
quietli in the eyes. pender' face wa grey and drawn; the hunt 
express domin it; the long recit had told upon him. 

"thank you, mr. pender," he said, a curiou glow show about hi fine, 
quiet face; "thank you for the sincer and frank of your account. 
but I think now there is noth further I need ask you." He indulg in 
a long scrutini of the author' haggard featur draw purpos the 
man' eye to hi own and then meet them with a look of power and 
confid calcul to inspir even the feeblest soul with courage. 
"and, to begin with," he added, smile pleasantly, "let me assur you 
without delay that you need have no alarm, for you are no more insan or 
delud than I myself am--" 

pender heav a deep sigh and tri to return the smile. 

"--and thi is simpli a case, so far as I can judg at present, of a 
veri singular psychic invasion, and a veri sinist one, too, if you 
perhap understand what I mean--" 

"it' an odd expression; you use it before, you know," said the author 
wearily, yet eagerli listen to everi word of the diagnosis, and 
deepli touch by the intellig sympathi which did not at onc 
indic the lunat asylum. 

"possibly," return the other, "and an odd affliction, too, you'll 
allow, yet one not unknown to the nation of antiquity, nor to those 
moderns, perhaps, who recognis the freedom of action under certain 
pathogen condit between thi world and another." 

"and you think," ask pender hastily, "that it is all primarili due to 
the _cannabis_? there is noth radic amiss with myself--noth 
incurable, or--?" 

"due entir to the overdose," dr. silenc repli emphatically, "to 
the drug' direct action upon your psychic being. It render you 
ultra-sensit and made you respond to an increas rate of vibration. 
and, let me tell you, mr. pender, that your experi might have had 
result far more dire. It ha brought you into touch with a somewhat 
singular class of invisible, but of one, I think, chiefli human in 
character. you might, however, just as easili have been drawn out of 
human rang altogether, and the result of such a conting would have 
been exceedingli terrible. indeed, you would not now be here to tell the 
tale. I need not alarm you on that score, but mention it as a warn 
you will not misunderstand or underr after what you have been 
through. 

"you look puzzled. you do not quit gather what I am drive at; and it 
is not to be expect that you should, for you, I suppose, are the 
nomin christian with the nomin christian' lofti standard of ethics, 
and hi utter ignor of spiritu possibilities. beyond a somewhat 
childish understand of 'spiritu wicked in high places,' you 
probabl have no concept of what is possibl onc you break-down the 
slender gulf that is merci fix between you and that outer world. 
but my studi and train have taken me far outsid these orthodox 
trips, and I have made experi that I could scarc speak to you 
about in languag that would be intellig to you." 

He paus a moment to note the breathless interest of pender' face and 
manner. everi word he utter wa calculated; he knew exactli the valu 
and effect of the emot he desir to waken in the heart of the 
afflict be befor him. 

"and from certain knowledg I have gain through variou experiences," 
he continu calmly, "I can diagnos your case as I said befor to be 
one of psychic invasion." 

"and the natur of this--er--invasion?" stammer the bewild writer 
of humor tales. 

"there is no reason whi I should not say at onc that I do not yet quit 
know," repli dr. silence. "I may first have to make one or two 
experiments--" 

"on me?" gasp pender, catch hi breath. 

"not exactly," the doctor said, with a grave smile, "but with your 
assistance, perhaps. I shall want to test the condit of the 
house--to ascertain, impossible, the charact of the forces, of thi 
strang person that ha been haunt you--" 

"at present you have no idea exactli who--what--why--" ask the 
other in a wild flurri of interest, dread and amazement. 

"I have a veri good idea, but no proof rather," return the doctor. 
"the effect of the drug in alter the scale of time and space, and 
merg the sens have noth primarili to do with the invasion. they 
come to ani one who is fool enough to take an experiment dose. It is 
the other featur of your case that are unusual. you see, you are now 
in touch with certain violent emotions, desires, purposes, still activ 
in thi house, that were produc in the past by some power and evil 
person that live here. how long ago, or whi they still persist so 
forcibly, I cannot posit say. but I should judg that they are 
mere forc act automat with the momentum of their terrif 
origin impetus." 

"not direct by a live being, a consciou will, you mean?" 

"possibl not--but none the less danger on that account, and more 
difficult to deal with. I cannot explain to you in a few minut the 
natur of such things, for you have not made the studi that would 
enabl you to follow me; but I have reason to believ that on the 
dissolut at death of a human being, it forc may still persist and 
continu to act in a blind, unconsci fashion. As a rule they speedili 
dissip themselves, but in the case of a veri power person 
they may last a long time. and, in some cases--of which I inclin to 
think thi is one--thes forc may coalesc with certain non-human 
entiti who thu continu their life indefinit and increas their 
strength to an unbeliev degree. If the origin person wa 
evil, the be attract to the left-ov forc will also be evil. In 
thi case, I think there ha been an unusu and dread aggrandis 
of the thought and purpos left behind long ago by a woman of 
consumm wicked and great person power of charact and 
intellect. now, do you begin to see what I am drive at a little?" 

pender stare fixedli at hi companion, plain horror show in hi 
eyes. but he found noth to say, and the doctor continued-- 

"in your case, predispos by the action of the drug, you have 
experienc the rush of these forc in undilut strength. they wholli 
obliter in you the sens of humour, fancy, imagination,--al that 
make for cheer and hope. they seek, though perhap automat 
only, to oust your own thought and establish themselv in their place. 
you are the victim of a psychic invasion. At the same time, you have 
becom clairvoy in the true sense. you are also a clairvoy 
victim." 

pender mop hi face and sighed. He left hi chair and went over to 
the fireplac to warm himself. 

"you must think me a quack to talk like this, or a madman," laugh dr. 
silence. "but never mind that. I have come to help you, and I can help 
you if you will do what I tell you. It is veri simple: you must leav 
thi hous at once. oh, never mind the difficulties; we will deal with 
those together. I can place anoth hous at your disposal, or I would 
take the leas here off your hands, and later have it pull down. your 
case interest me greatly, and I mean to see you through, so that you 
have no anxiety, and can drop back into your old groov of work 
tomorrow! the drug ha provid you, and therefor me, with a shortcut 
to a veri interest experience. I am grate to you." 

the author poke the fire vigorously, emot rise in him like a 
tide. He glanc toward the door nervously. 

"there is no need to alarm your wife or to tell her the detail of our 
conversation," pursu the other quietly. "let her know that you will 
soon be in possess again of your sens of humour and your health, and 
explain that I am lend you anoth hous for six months. meanwhil I 
may have the right to use thi hous for a night or two for my 
experiment. Is that understood between us?" 

"I can onli thank you from the bottom of my heart," stammer pender, 
unabl to find word to express hi gratitude. 

then he hesit for a moment, search the doctor' face anxiously. 

"and your experi with the house?" he said at length. 

"of the simplest character, my dear mr. pender. although I am myself an 
artifici train psychic, and consequ awar of the presenc of 
discarn entiti as a rule, I have so far felt noth here at all. 
thi make me sure that the forc act here are of an unusu 
description. what I propos to do is to make an experi with a view 
of draw out thi evil, coax it from it lair, so to speak, in 
order that it may _exhaust itself through me_ and becom dissip for 
ever. I have alreadi been inoculated," he added; "I consid myself to 
be immune." 

"heaven above!" gasp the author, collaps on to a chair. 

"hell beneath! might be a more appropri exclamation," the doctor 
laughed. "but, seriously, mr. pender, thi is what I propos to do--with 
your permission." 

"of course, of course," cri the other, "you have my permiss and my 
best wish for success. I can see no possibl objection, but--" 

"but what?" 

"I pray to heaven you will not undertak thi experi alone, will 
you?" 

"oh, dear, no; not alone." 

"you will take a companion with good nerves, and reliabl in case of 
disaster, won't you?" 

"I shall bring two companions," the doctor said. 

"ah, that' better. I feel easier. I am sure you must have among your 
acquaint men who--" 

"I shall not think of bring men, mr. pender." 

the other look up sharply. 

"no, or women either; or children." 

"I don't understand. who will you bring, then?" 

"animals," explain the doctor, unabl to prevent a smile at hi 
companion' express of surprise--"two animals, a cat and a dog." 

pender stare as if hi eye would drop out upon the floor, and then 
led the way without anoth word into the adjoin room where hi wife 
wa await them for tea. 


II 

A few day later the humorist and hi wife, with mind greatli relieved, 
move into a small furnish hous place at their free dispos in 
anoth part of london; and john silence, intent upon hi approach 
experiment, made readi to spend a night in the empti hous on the top of 
putney hill. onli two room were prepar for occupation: the studi on 
the ground floor and the bedroom immedi abov it; all other door 
were to be locked, and no servant wa to be left in the house. the motor 
had order to call for him at nine o'clock the follow morning. 

and, meanwhile, hi secretari had instruct to look up the past 
histori and associ of the place, and learn everyth he could 
concern the charact of former occupants, recent or remote. 

the animals, by whose sensit he intend to test ani unusu 
condit in the atmospher of the building, dr. silenc select with 
care and judgment. He believ (and had alreadi made curiou experi 
to prove it) that anim were more often, and more truly, clairvoy 
than human beings. mani of them, he felt convinced, possess power of 
percept far superior to that mere keen of the sens common to 
all dweller in the wild where the sens grow special alert; they 
had what he term "anim clairvoyance," and from hi experi with 
horses, dogs, cats, and even birds, he had drawn certain deductions, 
which, however, need not be refer to in detail here. 

cats, in particular, he believed, were almost continu consciou of 
a larger field of vision, too detail even for a photograph camera, 
and quit beyond the reach of normal human organs. He had, further, 
observ that while dog were usual terrifi in the presenc of such 
phenomena, cat on the other hand were sooth and satisfied. they 
welcom manifest as someth belong peculiarli to their own 
region. 

He select hi animals, therefore, with wisdom so that they might 
afford a differ test, each in it own way, and that one should not 
mere commun it own excit to the other. He took a dog and a 
cat. 

the cat he chose, now full grown, had live with him sinc kittenhood, a 
kittenhood of perplex sweet and audaci mischief. wayward it 
wa and fanciful, ever play it own mysteri game in the corner 
of the room, jump at invis nothings, leap sideway into the 
air and fall with tini moccasin feet on to anoth part of the 
carpet, yet with an air of dignifi earnest which show that the 
perform wa necessari to it own well-being, and not done mere to 
impress a stupid human audience. In the middl of elabor wash it 
would look up, startled, as though to stare at the approach of some 
invisible, cock it littl head sideway and put out a velvet pad 
to inspect cautiously. then it would get absent-minded, and stare with 
equal intent in anoth direct (just to confus the onlookers), 
and suddenli go on furious wash it bodi again, but in quit a new 
place. except for a white patch on it breast it wa coal black. and it 
name was--smoke. 

"smoke" describ it tempera as well as it appearance. it 
movements, it individuality, it pose as a littl furri mass of 
conceal mysteries, it elfin-lik elusiveness, all combin to justifi 
it name; and a subtl painter might have pictur it as a wisp of 
float smoke, the fire below betray itself at two point only--th 
glow eyes. 

all it forc ran to intelligence--secret intelligence, the wordless 
incalcul intuit of the cat. It was, indeed, _the_ cat for the 
busi in hand. 

the select of the dog wa not so simple, for the doctor own many; 
but after much deliber he chose a collie, call flame from hi 
yellow coat. true, it wa a trifl old, and stiff in the joints, and 
even begin to grow deaf, but, on the other hand, it wa a veri 
particular friend of smoke's, and had father it from kittenhood 
upward so that a subtl understand exist between them. It wa thi 
that turn the balanc in it favour, thi and it courage. moreover, 
though good-tempered, it wa a terribl fighter, and it anger when 
provok by a righteou caus wa a furi of fire, and irresistible. 

It had come to him quit young, straight from the shepherd, with the air 
of the hill yet in it nostrils, and wa then littl more than skin and 
bone and teeth. for a colli it wa sturdili built, it nose blunter 
than most, it yellow hair stiff rather than silky, and it had full 
eyes, unlik the slit eye of it breed. onli it master could touch it, 
for it ignor strangers, and despis their pattings--when ani dare to 
pat it. there wa someth patriarch about the old beast. He wa in 
earnest, and went through life with tremend energi and big thing in 
view, as though he had the reput of hi whole race to uphold. and 
to watch him fight against odd wa to understand whi he wa 
terrible. 

In hi relat with smoke he wa alway absurdli gentle; also he wa 
fatherly; and at the same time betray a certain diffid or shyness. 
He recognis that smoke call for strong yet respect management. 
the cat' circuit method puzzl him, and hi elabor pretenc 
perhap shock the dog' like for direct, undisguis action. yet, 
while he fail to comprehend these tortuou felin mysteries, he wa 
never contemptu or condescending; and he presid over the safeti of 
hi furri black friend somewhat as a father, loving, but intuitive, 
might superintend the vagari of a wayward and talent child. and, in 
return, smoke reward him with exhibit of fascin and audaci 
mischief. 

and these brief descript of their charact are necessari for the 
proper understand of what subsequ took place. 

with smoke sleep in the fold of hi fur coat, and the colli lie 
watch on the seat opposite, john silenc went down in hi motor after 
dinner on the night of novemb 15th. 

and the fog wa so dens that they were oblig to travel at quarter 
speed the entir way. 

* * * * * 

It wa after ten o'clock when he dismiss the motor and enter the 
dingi littl hous with the latchkey provid by pender. He found the 
hall ga turn low, and a fire in the study. book and food had also 
been place readi by the servant accord to instructions. coil of fog 
rush in after him through the open door and fill the hall and 
passag with it cold discomfort. 

the first thing dr. silenc did wa to lock up smoke in the studi with a 
saucer of milk befor the fire, and then make a search of the hous with 
flame. the dog ran cheer behind him all the way while he tri the 
door of the other room to make sure they were locked. He nose about 
into corner and made littl excurs on hi own account. hi manner 
wa expectant. He knew there must be someth unusu about the 
proceeding, becaus it wa contrari to the habit of hi whole life not 
to be asleep at thi hour on the mat in front of the fire. He kept 
look up into hi master' face, as door after door wa tried, with an 
express of intellig sympathy, but at the same time a certain air 
of disapproval. yet everyth hi master did wa good in hi eyes, and 
he betray as littl impati as possibl with all thi unnecessari 
journey to and fro. If the doctor wa pleas to play thi sort of 
game at such an hour of the night, it wa sure not for him to object. 
So he play it, too; and wa veri busi and earnest about it into the 
bargain. 

after an unev search they came down again to the study, and here 
dr. silenc discov smoke wash hi face calmli in front of the 
fire. the saucer of milk wa lick dri and clean; the preliminari 
examin that cat alway make in new surround had evid 
been satisfactorili concluded. He drew an arm-chair up to the fire, 
stir the coal into a blaze, arrang the tabl and lamp to hi 
satisfact for reading, and then prepar surreptiti to watch the 
animals. He wish to observ them care without their be awar 
of it. 

now, in spite of their respect ages, it wa the regular custom of 
these two to play togeth everi night befor sleep. smoke alway made 
the advances, begin with grave impud to pat the dog' tail, and 
flame play cumbrously, with condescension. It wa hi duty, rather 
than pleasure; he wa glad when it wa over, and sometim he wa veri 
determin and refus to play at all. 

and thi night wa one of the occas on which he wa firm. 

the doctor, look cautious over the top of hi book, watch the cat 
begin the performance. It start by gaze with an innoc express 
at the dog where he lay with nose on paw and eye wide open in the 
middl of the floor. then it got up and made as though it meant to walk 
to the door, go deliber and veri softly. flame' eye follow 
it until it wa beyond the rang of sight, and then the cat turn 
sharpli and began pat hi tail tent with one paw. the tail 
move slightli in reply, and smoke chang paw and tap it again. the 
dog, however, did not rise to play as wa hi wont, and the cat fell to 
part it briskli with both paws. flame still lay motionless. 

thi puzzl and bore the cat, and it went round and stare hard into 
it friend' face to see what wa the matter. perhap some inarticul 
messag flash from the dog' eye into it own littl brain, make it 
understand that the programm for the night had better not begin with 
play. perhap it onli realis that it friend wa immovable. but, 
whatev the reason, it usual persist thenceforward desert it, 
and it made no further attempt at persuasion. smoke yield at onc to 
the dog' mood; it sat down where it wa and began to wash. 

but the washing, the doctor noted, wa by no mean it real purpose; it 
onli use it to mask someth else; it stop at the most busi and 
furiou moment and began to stare about the room. it thought wander 
absurdly. It peer intent at the curtains; at the shadowi corners; at 
empti space above; leav it bodi in curious awkward posit for 
whole minut together. then it turn sharpli and stare with a sudden 
signal of intellig at the dog, and flame at onc rose somewhat 
stiffli to hi feet and began to wander aimlessli and restlessli to and 
fro about the floor. smoke follow him, pad quietli at hi heels. 
between them they made what seem to be a deliber search of the 
room. 

and, here, as he watch them, note care everi detail of the 
perform over the top of hi book, yet make no effort to 
interfere, it seem to the doctor that the first begin of a faint 
distress betray themselv in the collie, and in the cat the stir 
of a vagu excitement. 

He observ them closely. the fog wa thick in the air, and the tobacco 
smoke from hi pipe ad to it density; the furnitur at the far end 
stood mistily, and where the shadow congreg in hang cloud under 
the ceiling, it wa difficult to see clearli at all; the lamplight onli 
reach to a level of five feet from the floor, abov which came layer 
of compar darkness, so that the room appear twice as lofti as it 
actual was. By mean of the lamp and the fire, however, the carpet wa 
everywher clearli visible. 

the anim made their silent tour of the floor, sometim the dog 
leading, sometim the cat; occasion they look at one anoth as 
though exchang signals; and onc or twice, in spite of the limit 
space, he lost sight of one or other among the fog and the shadows. 
their curiosity, it appear to him, wa someth more than the 
excit lurk in the unknown territori of a strang room; yet, so 
far, it wa imposs to test this, and he purpos kept hi mind 
quietli recept lest the smallest mental excit on hi part should 
commun itself to the anim and thu destroy the valu of their 
independ behaviour. 

they made a veri thorough journey, leav no piec of furnitur 
unexamined, or unsmelt. flame led the way, walk slowli with lower 
head, and smoke follow demur at hi heels, make a transpar 
pretenc of not be interested, yet miss nothing. and, at length, 
they returned, the old colli first, and came to rest on the mat befor 
the fire. flame rest hi muzzl on hi master' knee, smile 
beatif while he pat the yellow head and spoke hi name; and 
smoke, come a littl later, pretend he came by chance, look from 
the empti saucer to hi face, lap up the milk when it wa given him 
to the last drop, and then sprang upon hi knee and curl round for 
the sleep it had fulli earn and intend to enjoy. 

silenc descend upon the room. onli the breath of the dog upon the 
mat came through the deep stillness, like the puls of time mark the 
minutes; and the steadi drip, drip of the fog outsid upon the 
window-ledg dismal testifi to the inclem of the night beyond. 
and the soft crash of the coal as the fire settl down into the 
grate becam less and less audibl as the fire sank and the flame 
resign their fierceness. 

It wa now well after eleven o'clock, and dr. silenc devot himself 
again to hi book. He read the word on the print page and took in 
their mean superficially, yet without start into life the 
correl of thought and suggest that should accompani 
interest reading. underneath, all the while, hi mental energi were 
absorb in watching, listening, wait for what might come. He wa not 
over-sanguin himself, yet he did not wish to be taken by surprise. 
moreover, the animals, hi sensit barometers, had incontin gone 
to sleep. 

after read a dozen pages, however, he realis that hi mind wa 
realli occupi in review the featur of pender' extraordinari 
story, and that it wa no longer necessari to steadi hi imagin by 
studi the dull paragraph detail in the page befor him. He laid 
down hi book accordingly, and allow hi thought to dwell upon the 
featur of the case. specul as to the meaning, however, he 
rigor suppressed, know that such thought would act upon hi 
imagin like wind upon the glow ember of a fire. 

As the night wore on the silenc grew deeper and deeper, and onli at 
rare interv he heard the sound of wheel on the main road a hundr 
yard away, where the hors went at a walk pace owe to the densiti 
of the fog. the echo of pedestrian footstep no longer reach him, the 
clamour of occasion voic no longer came down the side street. the 
night, muffl by fog, shroud by veil of ultim mystery, hung about 
the haunt villa like a doom. noth in the hous stirred. stillness, 
in a thick blanket, lay over the upper storeys. onli the mist in the 
room grew more dense, he thought, and the damp cold more penetrating. 
certainly, from time to time, he shivered. 

the collie, now deep in slumber, move occasionally,--grunted, sighed, 
or twitch hi leg in dreams. smoke lay on hi knees, a pool of warm, 
black fur, onli the closest observ detect the movement of hi 
sleek sides. It wa difficult to distinguish exactli where hi head and 
bodi join in that circl of glisten hair; onli a black satin nose 
and a tini tip of pink tongu betray the secret. 

dr. silenc watch him, and felt comfortable. the collie' breath 
wa soothing. the fire wa well built, and would burn for anoth two 
hour without attention. He wa not consciou of the least nervousness. 
He particularli wish to remain in hi ordinari and normal state of 
mind, and to forc nothing. If sleep came naturally, he would let it 
come--and even welcom it. the cold of the room, when the fire die 
down later, would be sure to wake him again; and it would then be time 
enough to carri these sleep baromet up to bed. from variou 
psychic premonit he knew quit well that the night would not pass 
without adventure; but he did not wish to forc it arrival; and he 
wish to remain normal, and let the anim remain normal, so that, 
when it came, it would be unattend by excit or by ani strain 
of the attention. mani experi had made him wise. and, for the rest, 
he had no fear. 

accordingly, after a time, he did fall asleep as he had expected, and 
the last thing he remembered, befor oblivion slip up over hi eye 
like soft wool, wa the pictur of flame stretch all four leg at 
once, and sigh noisili as he sought a more comfort posit for 
hi paw and muzzl upon the mat. 

* * * * * 

It wa a good deal later when he becam awar that a weight lay upon hi 
chest, and that someth wa pencil over hi face and mouth. A soft 
touch on the cheek woke him. someth wa pat him. 

He sat up with a jerk, and found himself stare straight into a pair of 
brilliant eyes, half green, half black. smoke' face lay level with hi 
own; and the cat had climb up with it front paw upon hi chest. 

the lamp had burn low and the fire wa nearli out, yet dr. silenc saw 
in a moment that the cat wa in an excit state. It knead with it 
front paw into hi chest, shift from one to the other. He felt them 
prod against him. It lift a leg veri care and pat hi 
cheek gingerly. it fur, he saw, wa stand ridgewis upon it back; 
the ear were flatten back somewhat; the tail wa switch sharply. 
the cat, of course, had waken him with a purpose, and the instant he 
realis this, he set it upon the arm of the chair and sprang up with a 
quick turn to face the empti room behind him. By some curiou instinct, 
hi arm of their own accord assum an attitud of defenc in front of 
him, as though to ward off someth that threaten hi safety. yet 
noth wa visible. onli shape of fog hung about rather heavili in the 
air, move slightli to and fro. 

hi mind wa now fulli alert, and the last vestig of sleep gone. He 
turn the lamp higher and peer about him. two thing he becam awar 
of at once: one, that smoke, while excited, wa _pleasurably_ excited; 
the other, that the colli wa no longer visibl upon the mat at hi 
feet. He had crept away to the corner of the wall farthest from the 
window, and lay watch the room with wide-open eyes, in which lurk 
plainli someth of alarm. 

someth in the dog' behaviour instantli struck dr. silenc as 
unusual, and, call him by name, he move across to pat him. flame got 
up, wag hi tail, and came over slowli to the rug, utter a low 
sound that wa half growl, half whine. He wa evid perturb about 
something, and hi master wa proceed to administ comfort when hi 
attent wa suddenli drawn to the antic of hi other four-foot 
companion, the cat. 

and what he saw fill him with someth like amazement. 

smoke had jump down from the back of the arm-chair and now occupi 
the middl of the carpet, where, with tail erect and leg stiff as 
ramrods, it wa steadili pace backward and forward in a narrow 
space, uttering, as it did so, those curiou littl guttur sound of 
pleasur that onli an anim of the felin speci know how to make 
express of suprem happiness. it stiffen leg and arch back made 
it appear larger than usual, and the black visag wore a smile of 
beatif joy. it eye blaze magnificently; it wa in an ecstasy. 

At the end of everi few pace it turn sharpli and stalk back again 
along the same line, pad softly, and pur like a roll of littl 
muffl drums. It behav precis as though it were rub against 
the ankl of some one who remain invisible. A thrill ran down the 
doctor' spine as he stood and stared. hi experi wa grow 
interest at last. 

He call the collie' attent to hi friend' perform to see 
whether he too wa awar of anyth stand there upon the carpet, and 
the dog' behaviour wa signific and corroborative. He came as far as 
hi master' knee and then stop dead, refus to investig 
closely. In vain dr. silenc urg him; he wag hi tail, whine a 
little, and stood in a half-crouch attitude, stare altern at 
the cat and at hi master' face. He was, apparently, both puzzl and 
alarmed, and the whine went deeper and deeper down into hi throat till 
it chang into an ugli snarl of awaken anger. 

then the doctor call to him in a tone of command he had never known to 
be disregarded; but still the dog, though spring up in response, 
declin to move nearer. He made tent motions, pranc a littl 
like a dog about to take to water, pretend to bark, and ran to and fro 
on the carpet. So far there wa no actual fear in hi manner, but he wa 
uneasi and anxious, and noth would induc him to go within touch 
distanc of the walk cat. onc he made a complet circuit, but alway 
care out of reach; and in the end he return to hi master' leg 
and rub vigor against him. flame did not like the perform at 
all: that much wa quit clear. 

for sever minut john silenc watch the perform of the cat with 
profound attent and without interfering. then he call to the anim 
by name. 

"smoke, you mysteri beastie, what in the world are you about?" he 
said, in a coax tone. 

the cat look up at him for a moment, smile in it ecstasy, blink 
it eyes, but too happi to pause. He spoke to it again. He call to it 
sever times, and each time it turn upon him it blaze eyes, drunk 
with inner delight, open and shut it lips, it bodi larg and 
rigid with excitement. yet it never for one instant paus in it short 
journey to and fro. 

He note exactli what it did: it walked, he saw, the same number of 
pace each time, some six or seven steps, and then it turn sharpli and 
retrac them. By the pattern of the great rose in the carpet he 
measur it. It kept to the same direct and the same line. It behav 
precis as though it were rub against someth solid. 
undoubtedly, there wa someth stand there on that strip of carpet, 
someth invis to the doctor, someth that alarm the dog, yet 
caus the cat unspeak pleasure. 

"smokie!" he call again, "smokie, you black mystery, what is it 
excit you so?" 

again the cat look up at him for a brief second, and then continu 
it sentry-walk, bliss happy, intens preoccupied. and, for an 
instant, as he watch it, the doctor wa awar that a faint uneasi 
stir in the depth of hi own being, focus itself for the moment 
upon thi curiou behaviour of the uncanni creatur befor him. 

there rose in him quit a new realis of the mysteri connect with 
the whole felin tribe, but especi with that common member of it, 
the domest cat--their hidden lives, their strang aloofness, their 
incalcul subtlety. how utterli remot from anyth that human 
be understood lay the sourc of their elus activities. As he 
watch the indescrib bear of the littl creatur minc along 
the strip of carpet under hi eyes, coquet with the power of 
darkness, welcoming, maybe, some fearsom visitor, there stir in hi 
heart a feel strang akin to awe. it indiffer to human kind, 
it seren superior to the obvious, struck him forcibl with fresh 
meaning; so remote, so inaccess seem the secret purpos of it 
real life, so alien to the blunder honesti of other animals. it 
absolut pois of bear brought into hi mind the opium-eater' word 
that "no digniti is perfect which doe not at some point alli itself 
with the mysterious"; and he becam suddenli awar that the presenc of 
the dog in thi foggy, haunt room on the top of putney hill wa 
uncommonli welcom to him. He wa glad to feel that flame' depend 
person wa with him. the savag growl at hi heel wa a 
pleasant sound. He wa glad to hear it. that march cat made him 
uneasy. 

find that smoke paid no further attent to hi words, the doctor 
decid upon action. would it rub against hi leg, too? He would take it 
by surpris and see. 

He step quickli forward and place himself upon the exact strip of 
carpet where it walked. 

but no cat is ever taken by surprise! the moment he occupi the space 
of the intruder, set hi feet on the woven rose midway in the line 
of travel, smoke suddenli stop pur and sat down. If lift up it 
face with the most innoc stare imagin of it green eyes. He could 
have sworn it laughed. It wa a perfect child again. In a singl second 
it had resum it simple, domest manner; and it gaze at him in such 
a way that he almost felt smoke wa the normal being, and _his_ wa the 
eccentr behaviour that wa be watched. It wa consummate, the 
manner in which it brought about thi chang so easili and so quickly. 

"superb littl actor!" he laugh in spite of himself, and stoop to 
stroke the shine black back. but, in a flash, as he touch it fur, 
the cat turn and spat at him viciously, strike at hi hand with one 
paw. then, with a hurri scutter of feet, it shot like a shadow across 
the floor and a moment later wa calmli sit over by the 
window-curtain wash it face as though noth interest it in the 
whole world but the clean of it cheek and whiskers. 

john silenc straighten himself up and drew a long breath. He realis 
that the perform wa temporarili at an end. the collie, meanwhile, 
who had watch the whole proceed with mark disapproval, had now 
lain down again upon the mat by the fire, no longer growling. It seem 
to the doctor just as though someth that had enter the room while 
he slept, alarm the dog, yet bring happi to the cat, had now 
gone out again, leav all as it wa before. whatev it wa that 
excit it bliss attent had retreat for the moment. 

He realis thi intuitively. smoke evid realis it, too, for 
present he deign to march back to the fireplac and jump upon hi 
master' knees. dr. silence, patient and determined, settl down onc 
more to hi book. the anim soon slept; the fire blaze cheerfully; 
and the cold fog from outsid pour into the room through everi 
avail chink and crannie. 

for a long time silenc and peac reign in the room and dr. silenc 
avail himself of the quiet to make care note of what had 
happened. He enter for futur use in other case an exhaust 
analysi of what he had observed, especi with regard to the effect 
upon the two animals. It is imposs here, nor would it be 
intellig to the reader unvers in the knowledg of the region known 
to a scientif train psychic like dr. silence, to detail these 
observations. but to him it wa clear, up to a certain point--for the 
rest he must still wait and watch. So far, at least, he realis that 
while he slept in the chair--that is, while hi will wa dormant--th 
room had suffer intrus from what he recognis as an intens 
activ force, and might later be forc to acknowledg as someth more 
than mere a blind force, namely, a distinct personality. 

So far it had affect himself scarc at all, but had act directli 
upon the simpler organ of the animals. It stimul keenli the 
centr of the cat' psychic being, induc a state of instant 
happi (intensifi it conscious probabl in the same way a 
drug or stimul intensifi that of a human being); wherea it alarm 
the less sensit dog, caus it to feel a vagu apprehens and 
distress. 

hi own sudden action and exhibit of energi had serv to dispers it 
temporarily, yet he felt convinced--th indic were not lack 
even while he sat there make notes--that it still remain near to 
him, condit if not spatially, and was, as it were, gather 
forc for a second attack. 

and, further, he intuit understood that the relat between the 
two anim had undergon a subtl change: that the cat had becom 
immeasur superior, confident, sure of itself in it own peculiar 
region, wherea flame had been weaken by an attack he could not 
comprehend and knew not how to repli to. though not yet afraid, he wa 
defiant--readi to act against a fear that he felt to be approaching. He 
wa no longer fatherli and protect toward the cat. smoke held the 
key to the situation; and both he and the cat knew it. 

thus, as the minut passed, john silenc sat and waited, keenli on the 
alert, wonder how soon the attack would be renewed, and at what point 
it would be divert from the anim and direct upon himself. 

the book lay on the floor besid him, hi note were complete. with one 
hand on the cat' fur, and the dog' front paw rest against hi 
feet, the three of them doze comfort befor the hot fire while the 
night wore on and the silenc deepen toward midnight. 

It wa well after one o'clock in the morn when dr. silenc turn the 
lamp out and light the candl preparatori to go up to bed. then 
smoke suddenli woke with a loud sharp purr and sat up. It neither 
stretched, wash nor turned: it listened. and the doctor, watch it, 
realis that a certain indefin chang had come about that veri 
moment in the room. A swift readjust of the forc within the four 
wall had taken place--a new disposit of their person equations. 
the balanc wa destroyed, the former harmoni gone. smoke, most 
sensit of barometers, had been the first to feel it, but the dog wa 
not slow to follow suit, for on look down he note that flame wa no 
longer asleep. He wa lie with eye wide open, and that same instant 
he sat up on hi great haunch and began to growl. 

dr. silenc wa in the act of take the match to re-light the lamp 
when an audibl movement in the room behind him made him pause. smoke 
leap down from hi knee and move forward a few pace across the 
carpet. then it stop and stare fixedly; and the doctor stood up on 
the rug to watch. 

As he rose the sound wa repeated, and he discov that it wa not in 
the room as he first thought, but outside, and that it came from more 
direct than one. there wa a rushing, sweep nois against the 
window-panes, and simultan a sound of someth brush against 
the door--out in the hall. smoke advanc sedat across the carpet, 
twitch hi tail, and sat down within a foot of the door. the 
influenc that had destroy the harmoni condit of the room had 
appar move in advanc of it cause. clearly, someth wa about 
to happen. 

for the first time that night john silenc hesitated; the thought of 
that dark narrow hall-way, choke with fog, and destitut of human 
comfort, wa unpleasant. He becam awar of a faint creep of hi 
flesh. He knew, of course, that the actual open of the door wa not 
necessari to the invas of the room that wa about to take place, 
sinc neither door nor windows, nor ani other solid barrier could 
interpos an obstacl to what wa seek entrance. yet the open of 
the door would be signific and symbolic, and he distinctli shrank 
from it. 

but for a moment only. smoke, turn with a show of impatience, 
recal him to hi purpose, and he move past the sitting, watch 
creature, and deliber open the door to it full width. 

what subsequ happened, happen in the feebl and flicker light 
of the solitari candl on the mantlepiece. 

through the open door he saw the hall, dimli lit and thick with fog. 
nothing, of course, wa visible--noth but the hat-stand, the african 
spear in dark line upon the wall and the high-back wooden chair 
stand grotesqu underneath on the oilcloth floor. for one instant 
the fog seem to move and thicken oddly; but he set that down to the 
score of the imagination. the door had open upon nothing. 

yet smoke appar thought otherwise, and the deep growl of the 
colli from the mat at the back of the room seem to confirm hi 
judgment. 

for, proud and self-possessed, the cat had again risen to hi feet, and 
have advanc to the door, wa now usher some one slowli into the 
room. noth could have been more evident. He pace from side to side, 
bow hi littl head with great _empressement_ and hold hi 
stiffen tail aloft like a flag-staff. He turn thi way and that, 
minc to and fro, and show sign of suprem satisfaction. He wa in 
hi element. He welcom the intrusion, and appar reckon that hi 
companions, the doctor and the dog, would welcom it likewise. 

the intrud had return for a second attack. 

dr. silenc move slowli backward and took up hi posit on the 
hearthrug, key himself up to a condit of concentr attention. 

He note that flame stood besid him, face the room, with bodi 
motionless, and head move swiftli from side to side with a curiou 
sway movement. hi eye were wide open, hi back rigid, hi neck and 
jaw thrust forward, hi leg tens and readi to leap. savage, readi for 
attack or defence, yet dread puzzl and perhap alreadi a littl 
cowed, he stood and stared, the hair on hi spine and side posit 
bristl outward as though a wind play through it. In the dim 
firelight he look like a great yellow-hair wolf, silent, eye 
shoot dark fire, exceedingli formidable. It wa flame, the terrible. 

smoke, meanwhile, advanc from the door toward the middl of the room, 
adopt the veri slow pace of an invis companion. A few feet away 
it stop and began to smile and blink it eyes. there wa someth 
deliber coax in it attitud as it stood there undecid on the 
carpet, clearli wish to effect some sort of introduct between the 
intrud and it canin friend and ally. It assum it most win 
manners, purring, smiling, look persuas from one to the other, 
and make quick tent step first in one direct and then in the 
other. there had alway exist such perfect understand between them 
in everything. sure flame would appreci smoke' intent now, and 
acquiesce. 

but the old colli made no advances. He bare hi teeth, lift hi 
lip till the gum showed, and stood stockstil with fix eye and 
heav sides. the doctor move a littl farther back, watch intent 
the smallest movement, and it wa just then he divin suddenli from the 
cat' behaviour and attitud that it wa not onli a singl companion it 
had usher into the room, but _several_. It kept cross over from one 
to the other, look up at each in turn. It sought to win over the dog 
to friendli with them all. the origin intrud had come back with 
reinforcements. and at the same time he further realis that the 
intrud wa someth more than a blindli act force, imperson 
though destructive. It wa a personality, and moreov a great 
personality. and it wa accompani for the purpos of assist by a 
host of other personalities, minor in degree, but similar in kind. 

He brace himself in the corner against the mantelpiec and waited, hi 
whole be rous to defence, for he wa now fulli awar that the 
attack had spread to includ himself as well as the animals, and he 
must be on the alert. He strain hi eye through the foggi atmosphere, 
tri in vain to see what the cat and dog saw; but the candlelight 
threw an uncertain and flicker light across the room and hi eye 
discern nothing. On the floor smoke move softli in front of him like 
a black shadow, hi eye gleam as he turn hi head, still tri 
with mani insinu gestur and much pur to bring about the 
introduct he desired. 

but it wa all in vain. flame stood rivet to one spot, motionless as a 
figur carv in stone. 

some minut passed, dure which onli the cat moved, and then there 
came a sharp change. flame began to back toward the wall. He move hi 
head from side to side as he went, sometim turn to snap at 
someth almost behind him. they were advanc upon him, tri to 
surround him. hi distress becam veri mark from now onwards, and it 
seem to the doctor that hi anger merg into genuin terror and 
becam overwhelm by it. the savag growl sound peril like a 
whine, and more than onc he tri to dive past hi master' legs, as 
though hunt for a way of escape. He wa tri to avoid someth 
that everywher block the way. 

thi terror of the indomit fighter impress the doctor enormously; 
yet also painfully; stir hi impatience; for he had never befor 
seen the dog show sign of give in, and it distress him to wit 
it. He knew, however, that he wa not give in easily, and understood 
that it wa realli imposs for him to gaug the animal' sensat 
properli at all. what flame felt, and saw, must be terribl inde to 
turn him all at onc into a coward. He face someth that made him 
afraid of more than hi life merely. the doctor spoke a few quick word 
of encourag to him, and stroke the bristl hair. but without 
much success. the colli seem alreadi beyond the reach of comfort such 
as that, and the collaps of the old dog follow inde veri speedili 
after this. 

and smoke, meanwhile, remain behind, watch the advance, but not 
join in it; sitting, pleas and expectant, consid that all wa 
go well and as it wished. It wa knead on the carpet with it 
front paws--slowly, laboriously, as though it feet were dip in 
treacle. the sound it claw made as they caught in the thread wa 
distinctli audible. It wa still smiling, blinking, purring. 

suddenli the colli utter a poignant short bark and leap heavili to 
one side. hi bare teeth trace a line of white through the gloom. 
the next instant he dash past hi master' legs, almost upset hi 
balance, and shot out into the room, where he went blunder wildli 
against wall and furniture. but that bark wa significant; the doctor 
had heard it befor and knew what it meant: for it wa the cri of the 
fighter against odd and it meant that the old beast had found hi 
courag again. possibl it wa onli the courag of despair, but at ani 
rate the fight would be terrific. and dr. silenc understood, too, 
that he dare not interfere. flame must fight hi own enemi in hi own 
way. 

but the cat, too, had heard that dread bark; and it, too, had 
understood. thi wa more than it had bargain for. across the dim 
shadow of that haunt room there must have pass some secret signal 
of distress between the animals. smoke stood up and look swiftli about 
him. He utter a piteou meow and trot smartli away into the greater 
dark by the windows. what hi object wa onli those endow with the 
spirit-lik intellig of cat might know. but, at ani rate, he had at 
last rang himself on the side of hi friend. and the littl beast 
meant business. 

At the same moment the colli manag to gain the door. the doctor saw 
him rush through into the hall like a flash of yellow light. He shot 
across the oilcloth, and tore up the stairs, but in anoth second he 
appear again, fli down the step and land at the bottom in a 
tumbl heap, whining, cringing, terrified. the doctor saw him slink 
back into the room again and crawl round by the wall toward the cat. 
was, then, even the staircas occupied? did _they_ stand also in the 
hall? wa the whole hous crowd from floor to ceiling? 

the thought came to add to the keen distress he felt at the sight of the 
collie' discomfiture. and, indeed, hi own person distress had 
increas in a mark degre dure the past minutes, and continu to 
increas steadili to the climax. He recognis that the drain on hi own 
vital grew steadily, and that the attack wa now direct against 
himself even more than against the defeat dog, and the too much 
deceiv cat. 

It all seem so rapid and uncalcul after that--th event that took 
place in thi littl modern room at the top of putney hill between 
midnight and sunrise--that dr. silenc wa hardli abl to follow and 
rememb it all. It came about with such uncanni swift and terror; 
the light wa so uncertain; the movement of the black cat so difficult 
to follow on the dark carpet, and the doctor himself so weari and taken 
by surprise--that he found it almost imposs to observ accurately, 
or to recal afterward precis what it wa he had seen or in what 
order the incid had taken place. He never could understand what 
defect of vision on hi part made it seem as though the cat had 
duplic itself at first, and then increas indefinitely, so that 
there were at least a dozen of them dart silent about the floor, 
leap softli on to chair and tables, pass like shadow from the 
open door to the end of the room, all black as sin, with brilliant green 
eye flash fire in all directions. It wa like the reflect from a 
score of mirror place round the wall at differ angles. nor could 
he make out at the time whi the size of the room seem to have altered, 
grown much larger, and whi it extend away behind him where ordinarili 
the wall should have been. the snarl of the enrag and terrifi 
colli sound sometim so far away; the ceil seem to have rais 
itself so much higher than before, and much of the furnitur had chang 
in appear and shift marvellously. 

It wa all so confus and confusing, as though the littl room he knew 
had becom merg and transform into the dimens of quit anoth 
chamber, that came to him, with it host of cat and it strang 
distances, in a sort of vision. 

but these chang came about a littl later, and at a time when hi 
attent wa so concentr upon the proceed of smoke and the 
collie, that he onli observ them, as it were, subconsciously. and the 
excitement, the flicker candlelight, the distress he felt for the 
collie, and the distort atmospher of fog were the poorest possibl 
alli to care observation. 

At first he wa onli awar that the dog wa repeat hi short 
danger bark from time to time, snap vicious at the empti air, a 
foot or so from the ground. once, indeed, he sprang upward and 
forwards, work furious with teeth and paws, and with a nois like 
wolv fighting, but onli to dash back the next minut against the wall 
behind him. then, after lie still for a bit, he rose to a crouch 
posit as though to spring again, snarl horribl and make short 
half-circl with lower head. and smoke all the while meow piteous 
by the window as though tri to draw the attack upon himself. 

then it wa that the rush of the whole dread busi seem to turn 
asid from the dog and direct itself upon hi own person. the colli had 
made anoth spring and fallen back with a crash into the corner, where 
he made nois enough in hi savag rage to waken the dead befor he fell 
to whine and then final lay still. and directli afterward the 
doctor' own distress becam intoler acute. He had made a half 
movement forward to come to the rescu when a veil that wa denser than 
mere fog seem to drop down over the scene, drape room, walls, 
anim and fire in a mist of dark and fold also about hi own 
mind. other form move silent across the field of vision, form that 
he recognis from previou experiments, and welcom not. unholi 
thought began to crowd into hi brain, sinist suggest of evil 
present themselv seductively. ice seem to settl about hi heart, 
and hi mind trembled. He began to lose memory--memori of hi identity, 
of where he was, of what he ought to do. the veri foundat of hi 
strength were shaken. hi will seem paralysed. 

and it wa then that the room fill with thi hord of cats, all dark 
as the night, all silent, all with lamp eye of green fire. the 
dimens of the place alter and shifted. He wa in a much larger 
space. the whine of the dog sound far away, and all about him the 
cat flew busili to and fro, silent play their tearing, rush 
game of evil, weav the pattern of their dark purpos upon the floor. 
He strove hard to collect himself and rememb the word of power he had 
made use of befor in similar dread posit where hi danger 
practic had sometim led; but he could recal noth consecutively; a 
mist lay over hi mind and memory; he felt daze and hi forc 
scattered. the deep within were too troubl for heal power to come 
out of them. 

It wa glamour, of course, he realis afterwards, the strong glamour 
thrown upon hi imagin by some power person behind the 
veil; but at the time he wa not suffici awar of thi and, as with 
all true glamour, wa unabl to grasp where the true end and the fals 
began. He wa caught momentarili in the same vortex that had sought to 
lure the cat to destruct through it delight, and threaten utterli 
to overwhelm the dog through it terror. 

there came a sound in the chimney behind him like wind boom and 
tear it way down. the window rattled. the candl flicker and went 
out. the glacial atmospher close round him with the cold of death, and 
a great rush sound swept by overhead as though the ceil had lift 
to a great height. He heard the door shut. far away it sounded. He felt 
lost, shelterless in the depth of hi soul. yet still he held out and 
resist while the climax of the fight came nearer and nearer.... He had 
step into the stream of forc awaken by pender and he knew that he 
must withstand them to the end or come to a conclus that it wa not 
good for a man to come to. someth from the region of utter cold wa 
upon him. 

and then quit suddenly, through the confus mist about him, there 
slowli rose up the person that had been all the time direct the 
battle. some forc enter hi be that shook him as the tempest 
shake a leaf, and close against hi eyes--clean level with hi face--h 
found himself stare into the wreck of a vast dark countenance, a 
counten that wa terribl even in it ruin. 

for ruin it was, and terribl it was, and the mark of spiritu evil 
wa brand everywher upon it broken features. eyes, face and hair 
rose level with hi own, and for a space of time he never could properli 
measure, or determine, these two, a man and a woman, look straight 
into each other' visag and down into each other' hearts. 

and john silence, the soul with the good, unselfish motive, held hi own 
against the dark discarn woman whose motiv wa pure evil, and whose 
soul wa on the side of the dark powers. 

It wa the climax that touch the depth of power within him and began 
to restor him slowli to hi own. He wa conscious, of course, of 
effort, and yet it seem no superhuman one, for he had recognis the 
charact of hi opponent' power, and he call upon the good within 
him to meet and overcom it. the inner forc stir and trembl in 
respons to hi call. they did not at first come readili as wa their 
habit, for under the spell of glamour they had alreadi been diabol 
lull into inactivity, but come they eventu did, rise out of the 
inner spiritu natur he had learn with so much time and pain to 
awaken to life. and power and confid came with them. He began to 
breath deepli and regularly, and at the same time to absorb into 
himself the forc oppos to him, and to _turn them to hi own 
account_. By ceas to resist, and allow the deadli stream to pour 
into him unopposed, he use the veri power suppli by hi adversari and 
thu enorm increas hi own. 

for thi spiritu alchemi he had learned. He understood that forc 
ultim is everywher one and the same; it is the motiv behind that 
make it good or evil; and hi motiv wa entir unselfish. He 
knew--provid he wa not first rob of self-control--how vicari 
to absorb these evil radiat into himself and chang them magic 
into hi own good purposes. and, sinc hi motiv wa pure and hi soul 
fearless, they could not work him harm. 

thu he stood in the main stream of evil unwittingli attract by 
pender, deflect it cours upon himself; and after pass through 
the purifi filter of hi own unselfish these energi could onli 
add to hi store of experience, of knowledge, and therefor of power. 
and, as hi self-control return to him, he gradual accomplish thi 
purpose, even though trembl while he did so. 

yet the struggl wa severe, and in spite of the freez chill of the 
air, the perspir pour down hi face. then, by slow degrees, the 
dark and dread counten faded, the glamour pass from hi soul, 
the normal proport return to wall and ceiling, the form melt 
back into the fog, and the whirl of rush shadow-cat disappear 
whenc they came. 

and with the return of the conscious of hi own ident john 
silenc wa restor to the full control of hi own will-power. In a 
deep, modul voic he began to utter certain rhythmic sound that 
slowli roll through the air like a rise sea, fill the room with 
power vibratori activ that whelm all irregular of lesser 
vibrat in it own swell tone. He made certain sigils, gestur 
and movement at the same time. for sever minut he continu to 
utter these words, until at length the grow volum domin the 
whole room and master the manifest of all that oppos it. for 
just as he understood the spiritu alchemi that can transmut evil 
forc by rais them into higher channels, so he knew from long studi 
the occult use of sound, and it direct effect upon the plastic region 
wherein the power of spiritu evil work their fell purposes. harmoni 
wa restor first of all to hi own soul, and thenc to the room and 
all it occupants. 

and, after himself, the first to recognis it wa the old dog lie in 
hi corner. flame began suddenli utter sound of pleasure, that 
"something" between a growl and a grunt that dog make upon be 
restor to their master' confidence. dr. silenc heard the thump of 
the collie' tail against the floor. and the grunt and the thump 
touch the depth of affect in the man' heart, and gave him some 
inkl of what agoni the dumb creatur had suffered. 

next, from the shadow by the window, a somewhat shrill pur 
announc the restor of the cat to it normal state. smoke wa 
advanc across the carpet. He seem veri pleas with himself, and 
smile with an express of suprem innocence. He wa no shadow-cat, 
but real and full of hi usual and perfect self-possession. He march 
along, pick hi way delicately, but with a state digniti that 
suggest hi ancestri with the majesti of egypt. hi eye no longer 
glared; they shone steadili befor him, they radiated, not excitement, 
but knowledge. clearli he wa anxiou to make amend for the mischief to 
which he had unwittingli lent himself owe to hi subtl and electr 
constitution. 

still utter hi sharp high pur he march up to hi master and 
rub vigor against hi legs. then he stood on hi hind feet and 
paw hi knee and stare beseechingli up into hi face. He turn hi 
head toward the corner where the colli still lay, thump hi tail 
feebli and pathetically. 

john silenc understood. He bent down and stroke the creature' live 
fur, note the line of bright blue spark that follow the motion of 
hi hand down it back. and then they advanc togeth toward the 
corner where the dog was. 

smoke went first and put hi nose gentli against hi friend' muzzle, 
pur while he rubbed, and utter littl soft sound of affect in 
hi throat. the doctor lit the candl and brought it over. He saw the 
colli lie on it side against the wall; it wa utterli exhausted, and 
foam still hung about it jaws. it tail and eye respond to the sound 
of it name, but it wa evid veri weak and overcome. smoke 
continu to rub against it cheek and nose and eyes, sometim even 
stand on it bodi and knead into the thick yellow hair. flame 
repli from time to time by littl lick of the tongue, most of them 
curious misdirected. 

but dr. silenc felt intuit that someth disastr had happened, 
and hi heart wa wrung. He stroke the dear body, feel it over for 
bruis or broken bones, but find none. He fed it with what remain 
of the sandwich and milk, but the creatur clumsili upset the saucer 
and lost the sandwich between it paws, so that the doctor had to feed 
it with hi own hand. and all the while smoke meow piteously. 

then john silenc began to understand. He went across to the farther 
side of the room and call aloud to it. 

"flame, old man! come!" 

At ani other time the dog would have been upon him in an instant, 
bark and leap to the shoulder. and even now he got up, though 
heavili and awkwardly, to hi feet. He start to run, wag hi tail 
more briskly. He collid first with a chair, and then ran straight into 
a table. smoke trot close at hi side, tri hi veri best to guid 
him. but it wa useless. dr. silenc had to lift him up into hi own 
arm and carri him like a baby. for he wa blind. 


iii 

It wa a week later when john silenc call to see the author in hi 
new house, and found him well on the way to recoveri and alreadi busi 
again with hi writing. the haunt look had left hi eyes, and he 
seem cheer and confident. 

"humour restored?" laugh the doctor, as soon as they were comfort 
settl in the room overlook the park. 

"i'v had no troubl sinc I left that dread place," return pender 
gratefully; "and thank to you--" 

the doctor stop him with a gesture. 

"never mind that," he said, "we'll discuss your new plan afterwards, 
and my scheme for reliev you of the hous and help you settl 
elsewhere. Of cours it must be pull down, for it' not fit for ani 
sensit person to live in, and ani other tenant might be afflict in 
the same way you were. although, personally, I think the evil ha 
exhaust itself by now." 

He told the astonish author someth of hi experi in it with 
the animals. 

"I don't pretend to understand," pender said, when the account wa 
finished, "but I and my wife are intens reliev to be free of it 
all. onli I must say I should like to know someth of the former 
histori of the house. when we took it six month ago I heard no word 
against it." 

dr. silenc drew a typewritten paper from hi pocket. 

"I can satisfi your curios to some extent," he said, run hi eye 
over the sheets, and then replac them in hi coat; "for by my 
secretary' investig I have been abl to check certain inform 
obtain in the hypnot tranc by a 'sensitive' who help me in such 
cases. the former occup who haunt you appear to have been a woman 
of singularli atroci life and charact who final suffer death by 
hanging, after a seri of crime that appal the whole of england and 
onli came to light by the merest chance. she came to her end in the year 
1798, for it wa not thi particular hous she live in, but a much 
larger one that then stood upon the site it now occupies, and wa then, 
of course, not in london, but in the country. she wa a person of 
intellect, possess of a powerful, train will, and of consumm 
audacity, and I am convinc avail herself of the resourc of the 
lower magic to attain her ends. thi goe far to explain the virul 
of the attack upon yourself, and whi she is still abl to carri on after 
death the evil practic that form her main purpos dure life." 

"you think that after death a soul can still conscious direct--" 
gasp the author. 

"I think, as I told you before, that the forc of a power 
person may still persist after death in the line of their origin 
momentum," repli the doctor; "and that strong thought and purpos 
can still react upon suitabl prepar brain long after their 
origin have pass away. 

"if you knew anyth of magic," he pursued, "you would know that 
thought is dynamic, and that it may call into exist form and 
pictur that may well exist for hundr of years. for, not far remov 
from the region of our human life is anoth region where float the 
wast and drift of all the centuries, the limbo of the shell of the 
dead; a dens popul region cram with horror and abomin of 
all descriptions, and sometim galvanis into activ life again by the 
will of a train manipulator, a mind vers in the practic of lower 
magic. that thi woman understood it vile commerce, I am persuaded, 
and the forc she set go dure her life have simpli been 
accumul ever since, and would have continu to do so had they not 
been drawn down upon yourself, and afterward discharg and satisfi 
through me. 

"anyth might have brought down the attack, for, besid drugs, there 
are certain violent emotions, certain mood of the soul, certain 
spiritu fevers, if I may so call them, which directli open the inner 
be to a cognis of thi astral region I have mentioned. In your 
case it happen to be a peculiarli potent drug that did it. 

"but now, tell me," he added, after a pause, hand to the perplex 
author a pencil draw he had made of the dark counten that had 
appear to him dure the night on putney hill--"tel me if you 
recognis thi face?" 

pender look at the draw closely, greatli astonished. He shudder a 
littl as he looked. 

"undoubtedly," he said, "it is the face I kept tri to draw--dark, 
with the great mouth and jaw, and the droop eye. that is the woman." 

dr. silenc then produc from hi pocket-book an old-fashion woodcut 
of the same person which hi secretari had unearth from the record of 
the newgat calendar. the woodcut and the pencil draw were two 
differ aspect of the same dread visage. the men compar them for 
some moment in silence. 

"it make me thank god for the limit of our senses," said pender 
quietly, with a sigh; "continu clairvoy must be a sore 
affliction." 

"it is indeed," return john silenc significantly, "and if all the 
peopl nowaday who claim to be clairvoy were realli so, the 
statist of suicid and lunaci would be consider higher than they 
are. It is littl wonder," he added, "that your sens of humour wa 
clouded, with the mind-forc of that dead monster tri to use your 
brain for their dissemination. you have had an interest adventure, 
mr. felix pender, and, let me add, a fortun escape." 

the author wa about to renew hi thank when there came a sound of 
scratch at the door, and the doctor sprang up quickly. 

"it' time for me to go. I left my dog on the step, but I suppose--" 

befor he had time to open the door, it had yield to the pressur 
behind it and flew wide open to admit a great yellow-hair collie. the 
dog, wag hi tail and contort hi whole bodi with delight, tore 
across the floor and tri to leap up upon hi owner' breast. and there 
wa laughter and happi in the old eyes; for they were clear again as 
the day. 




case ii: ancient sorceri 


I 

there are, it would appear, certain wholli unremark persons, with 
none of the characterist that invit adventure, who yet onc or twice 
in the cours of their smooth live undergo an experi so strang 
that the world catch it breath--and look the other way! and it wa 
case of thi kind, perhaps, more than ani other, that fell into the 
wide-spread net of john silence, the psychic doctor, and, appeal to 
hi deep humanity, to hi patience, and to hi great qualiti of 
spiritu sympathy, led often to the revel of problem of the 
strangest complexity, and of the profoundest possibl human interest. 

matter that seem almost too curiou and fantast for belief he love 
to trace to their hidden sources. To unravel a tangl in the veri soul 
of things--and to releas a suffer human soul in the process--wa 
with him a verit passion. and the knot he unti were, indeed, 
after pass strange. 

the world, of course, ask for some plausibl basi to which it can 
attach credence--someth it can, at least, pretend to explain. the 
adventur type it can understand: such peopl carri about with them an 
adequ explan of their excit lives, and their charact 
obvious drive them into the circumst which produc the 
adventures. It expect noth els from them, and is satisfied. but 
dull, ordinari folk have no right to out-of-the-way experiences, and the 
world have been led to expect otherwise, is disappoint with them, 
not to say shocked. it complac judgment ha been rude disturbed. 

"such a thing happen to _that_ man!" it cries--"a commonplac person 
like that! It is too absurd! there must be someth wrong!" 

yet there could be no question that someth did actual happen to 
littl arthur vezin, someth of the curiou natur he describ to dr. 
silence. outwardli or inwardly, it happen beyond a doubt, and in spite 
of the jeer of hi few friend who heard the tale, and observ wise 
that "such a thing might perhap have come to iszard, that crack-brain 
iszard, or to that odd fish minski, but it could never have happen to 
commonplac littl vezin, who wa fore-ordain to live and die 
accord to scale." 

but, whatev hi method of death was, vezin certainli did not "live 
accord to scale" so far as thi particular event in hi otherwis 
unev life wa concerned; and to hear him recount it, and watch hi 
pale delic featur change, and hear hi voic grow softer and more 
hush as he proceeded, wa to know the convict that hi halt 
word perhap fail sometim to convey. He live the thing over again 
each time he told it. hi whole person becam muffl in the 
recital. It subdu him more than ever, so that the tale becam a 
lengthi apolog for an experi that he deprecated. He appear to 
excus himself and ask your pardon for have dare to take part in so 
fantast an episode. for littl vezin wa a timid, gentle, sensit 
soul, rare abl to assert himself, tender to man and beast, and almost 
constitut unabl to say no, or to claim mani thing that should 
rightli have been his. hi whole scheme of life seem utterli remot 
from anyth more excit than miss a train or lose an umbrella 
on an omnibus. and when thi curiou event came upon him he wa alreadi 
more year beyond forti than hi friend suspect or he care to admit. 

john silence, who heard him speak of hi experi more than once, said 
that he sometim left out certain detail and put in others; yet they 
were all obvious true. the whole scene wa unforgett 
cinematograph on to hi mind. none of the detail were imagin or 
invented. and when he told the stori with them all complete, the effect 
wa undeniable. hi appeal brown eye shone, and much of the charm 
personality, usual so care repressed, came forward and reveal 
itself. hi modesti wa alway there, of course, but in the tell he 
forgot the present and allow himself to appear almost vividli as he 
live again in the past of hi adventure. 

He wa on the way home when it happened, cross northern franc from 
some mountain trip or other where he buri himself solitary-wis everi 
summer. He had noth but an unregist bag in the rack, and the 
train wa jam to suffocation, most of the passeng be unredeem 
holiday english. He dislik them, not becaus they were hi 
fellow-countrymen, but becaus they were noisi and obtrusive, 
obliter with their big limb and tweed cloth all the quieter 
tint of the day that brought him satisfact and enabl him to melt 
into insignific and forget that he wa anybody. these english 
clash about him like a brass band, make him feel vagu that he 
ought to be more self-assert and obstreperous, and that he did not 
claim insist enough all kind of thing that he didn't want and 
that were realli valueless, such as corner seats, window up or down, 
and so forth. 

So that he felt uncomfort in the train, and wish the journey were 
over and he wa back again live with hi unmarri sister in surbiton. 

and when the train stop for ten pant minut at the littl station 
in northern france, and he got out to stretch hi leg on the platform, 
and saw to hi dismay a further batch of the british isl debouch 
from anoth train, it suddenli seem imposs to him to continu the 
journey. even _his_ flabbi soul revolted, and the idea of stay a 
night in the littl town and go on next day by a slower, emptier 
train, flash into hi mind. the guard wa alreadi shout "_en 
voiture_" and the corridor of hi compart wa alreadi pack when 
the thought came to him. and, for once, he act with decis and 
rush to snatch hi bag. 

find the corridor and step impassable, he tap at the window (for 
he had a corner seat) and beg the frenchman who sat opposit to hand 
hi luggag out to him, explain in hi wretch french that he 
intend to break the journey there. and thi elderli frenchman, he 
declared, gave him a look, half of warning, half of reproach, that to 
hi die day he could never forget; hand the bag through the window 
of the move train; and at the same time pour into hi ear a long 
sentence, spoken rapidli and low, of which he wa abl to comprehend 
onli the last few words: "_à caus du sommeil et à caus de chats_." 

In repli to dr. silence, whose singular psychic acut at onc seiz 
upon thi frenchman as a vital point in the adventure, vezin admit 
that the man had impress him favour from the beginning, though 
without be abl to explain why. they had sat face one anoth 
dure the four hour of the journey, and though no convers had 
pass between them--vezin wa timid about hi stutter french--h 
confess that hi eye were be continu drawn to hi face, 
almost, he felt, to rudeness, and that each, by a dozen nameless littl 
polit and attentions, had evinc the desir to be kind. the men 
like each other and their person did not clash, or would not 
have clash had they chanc to come to term of acquaintance. the 
frenchman, indeed, seem to have exercis a silent protect 
influenc over the insignific littl englishman, and without word or 
gestur betray that he wish him well and would gladli have been of 
servic to him. 

"and thi sentenc that he hurl at you after the bag?" ask john 
silence, smile that peculiarli sympathet smile that alway melt 
the prejudic of hi patient, "were you unabl to follow it exactly?" 

"it wa so quick and low and vehement," explain vezin, in hi small 
voice, "that I miss practic the whole of it. I onli caught the few 
word at the veri end, becaus he spoke them so clearly, and hi face 
wa bent down out of the carriag window so near to mine." 

"'_à caus du sommeil et à caus de chats'?_" repeat dr. silence, as 
though half speak to himself. 

"that' it exactly," said vezin; "which, I take it, mean someth like 
'becaus of sleep and becaus of the cats,' doesn't it?" 

"certainly, that' how I should translat it," the doctor observ 
shortly, evid not wish to interrupt more than necessary. 

"and the rest of the sentence--al the first part I couldn't understand, 
I mean--wa a warn not to do something--not to stop in the town, or 
at some particular place in the town, perhaps. that wa the impress 
it made on me." 

then, of course, the train rush off, and left vezin stand on the 
platform alon and rather forlorn. 

the littl town climb in straggl fashion up a sharp hill rise out 
of the plain at the back of the station, and wa crown by the twin 
tower of the ruin cathedr peep over the summit. from the station 
itself it look uninterest and modern, but the fact wa that the 
mediaev posit lay out of sight just beyond the crest. and onc he 
reach the top and enter the old streets, he step clean out of 
modern life into a bygon century. the nois and bustl of the crowd 
train seem day away. the spirit of thi silent hill-town, remot from 
tourist and motor-cars, dream it own quiet life under the autumn 
sun, rose up and cast it spell upon him. long befor he recognis thi 
spell he act under it. He walk softly, almost on tiptoe, down the 
wind narrow street where the gabl all but met over hi head, and 
he enter the doorway of the solitari inn with a deprec and modest 
demeanour that wa in itself an apolog for intrud upon the place and 
disturb it dream. 

At first, however, vezin said, he notic veri littl of all this. the 
attempt at analysi came much later. what struck him then wa onli the 
delight contrast of the silenc and peac after the dust and noisi 
rattl of the train. He felt sooth and stroke like a cat. 

"like a cat, you said?" interrupt john silence, quickli catch him 
up. 

"yes. At the veri start I felt that." He laugh apologetically. "I felt 
as though the warmth and the still and the comfort made me purr. It 
seem to be the gener mood of the whole place--then." 

the inn, a rambl ancient house, the atmospher of the old coach 
day still about it, appar did not welcom him too warmly. He felt 
he wa onli tolerated, he said. but it wa cheap and comfortable, and 
the delici cup of afternoon tea he order at onc made him feel 
realli veri pleas with himself for leav the train in thi bold, 
origin way. for to him it had seem bold and original. He felt 
someth of a dog. hi room, too, sooth him with it dark panel 
and low irregular ceiling, and the long slope passag that led to it 
seem the natur pathway to a real chamber of sleep--a littl dim 
cubbi hole out of the world where nois could not enter. It look upon 
the courtyard at the back. It wa all veri charming, and made him think 
of himself as dress in veri soft velvet somehow, and the floor seem 
padded, the wall provid with cushions. the sound of the street 
could not penetr there. It wa an atmospher of absolut rest that 
surround him. 

On engag the two-franc room he had interview the onli person who 
seem to be about that sleepi afternoon, an elderli waiter with 
dundreari whisker and a drowsi courtesy, who had ambl lazili toward 
him across the stone yard; but on come downstair again for a littl 
promenad in the town befor dinner he encount the proprietress 
herself. she wa a larg woman whose hands, feet, and featur seem to 
swim toward him out of a sea of person. they emerged, so to speak. but 
she had great dark, vivaci eye that counteract the bulk of her 
body, and betray the fact that in realiti she wa both vigor and 
alert. when he first caught sight of her she wa knit in a low chair 
against the sunlight of the wall, and someth at onc made him see her 
as a great tabbi cat, dozing, yet awake, heavili sleepy, and yet at the 
same time prepar for instantan action. A great mouser on the watch 
occur to him. 

she took him in with a singl comprehens glanc that wa polit 
without be cordial. her neck, he noticed, wa extraordinarili suppl 
in spite of it proportions, for it turn so easili to follow him, and 
the head it carri bow so veri flexibly. 

"but when she look at me, you know," said vezin, with that littl 
apologet smile in hi brown eyes, and that faintli deprec gestur 
of the shoulder that wa characterist of him, "the odd notion came to 
me that realli she had intend to make quit a differ movement, and 
that with a singl bound she could have leap at me across the width of 
that stone yard and pounc upon me like some huge cat upon a mouse." 

He laugh a littl soft laugh, and dr. silenc made a note in hi book 
without interrupting, while vezin proceed in a tone as though he 
fear he had alreadi told too much and more than we could believe. 

"veri soft, yet veri activ she was, for all her size and mass, and I 
felt she knew what I wa do even after I had pass and wa behind 
her back. she spoke to me, and her voic wa smooth and running. she 
ask if I had my luggage, and wa comfort in my room, and then 
ad that dinner wa at seven o'clock, and that they were veri earli 
peopl in thi littl countri town. clearly, she intend to convey that 
late hour were not encouraged." 

evidently, she contriv by voic and manner to give him the impress 
that here he would be "managed," that everyth would be arrang and 
plan for him, and that he had noth to do but fall into the groov 
and obey. No decid action or sharp person effort would be look for 
from him. It wa the veri revers of the train. He walk quietli out 
into the street feel sooth and peaceful. He realis that he wa in 
a _milieu_ that suit him and stroke him the right way. It wa so much 
easier to be obedient. He began to purr again, and to feel that all the 
town pur with him. 

about the street of that littl town he meander gently, fall 
deeper and deeper into the spirit of repos that characteris it. with 
no special aim he wander up and down, and to and fro. the septemb 
sunshin fell slantingli over the roofs. down wind alleyways, fring 
with tumbl gabl and open casements, he caught fairylik glimps of 
the great plain below, and of the meadow and yellow cops lie like a 
dream-map in the haze. the spell of the past held veri potent here, he 
felt. 

the street were full of picturesqu garb men and women, all busi 
enough, go their respect ways; but no one took ani notic of him 
or turn to stare at hi obvious english appearance. He wa even abl 
to forget that with hi tourist appear he wa a fals note in a 
charm picture, and he melt more and more into the scene, feel 
delight insignific and unimport and unselfconscious. It wa 
like becom part of a softli colour dream which he did not even 
realis to be a dream. 

On the eastern side the hill fell away more sharply, and the plain below 
ran off rather suddenli into a sea of gather shadow in which the 
littl patch of woodland look like island and the stubbl field 
like deep water. here he stroll along the old rampart of ancient 
fortif that onc had been formidable, but now were onli 
vision-lik with their charm mingl of broken grey wall and 
wayward vine and ivy. from the broad cope on which he sat for a 
moment, level with the round top of clip plane trees, he saw the 
esplanad far below lie in shadow. here and there a yellow sunbeam 
crept in and lay upon the fallen yellow leaves, and from the height he 
look down and saw that the townsfolk were walk to and fro in the 
cool of the evening. He could just hear the sound of their slow 
footfalls, and the murmur of their voic float up to him through the 
gap between the trees. the figur look like shadow as he caught 
glimps of their quiet movement far below. 

He sat there for some time pondering, bath in the wave of murmur and 
half-lost echo that rose to hi ears, muffl by the leav of the 
plane trees. the whole town, and the littl hill out of which it grew as 
natur as an ancient wood, seem to him like a be lie there 
half asleep on the plain and croon to itself as it dozed. 

and, presently, as he sat lazili melt into it dream, a sound of 
horn and string and wood instrument rose to hi ears, and the town 
band began to play at the far end of the crowd terrac below to the 
accompani of a veri soft, deep-throat drum. vezin wa veri 
sensit to music, knew about it intelligently, and had even ventured, 
unknown to hi friends, upon the composit of quiet melodi with 
low-run chord which he play to himself with the soft pedal when 
no one wa about. and thi music float up through the tree from an 
invis and doubtless veri picturesqu band of the townspeopl wholli 
charm him. He recognis noth that they played, and it sound as 
though they were simpli improvis without a conductor. No definit 
mark time ran through the pieces, which end and began oddli after 
the fashion of wind through an aeolian harp. It wa part of the place 
and scene, just as the die sunlight and faintli breath wind were 
part of the scene and hour, and the mellow note of old-fashion 
plaintiv horns, pierc here and there by the sharper strings, all half 
smother by the continu boom of the deep drum, touch hi soul 
with a curious potent spell that wa almost too engross to be quit 
pleasant. 

there wa a certain queer sens of bewitch in it all. the music 
seem to him oddli unartificial. It made him think of tree swept by 
the wind, of night breez sing among wire and chimney-stacks, or in 
the rig of invis ships; or--and the simil leap up in hi 
thought with a sudden sharp of suggestion--a choru of animals, of 
wild creatures, somewher in desol place of the world, cri and 
sing as anim will, to the moon. He could fanci he heard the 
wailing, half-human cri of cat upon the tile at night, rise and 
fall with weird interv of sound, and thi music, muffl by 
distanc and the trees, made him think of a queer compani of these 
creatur on some roof far away in the sky, utter their solemn music 
to one anoth and the moon in chorus. 

It was, he felt at the time, a singular imag to occur to him, yet it 
express hi sensat pictori better than anyth else. the 
instrument play such imposs odd intervals, and the crescendo and 
diminuendo were so veri suggest of cat-land on the tile at night, 
rise swiftly, drop without warn to deep note again, and all in 
such strang confus of discord and accords. but, at the same time a 
plaintiv sweet result on the whole, and the discord of these 
half-broken instrument were so singular that they did not distress hi 
music soul like fiddl out of tune. 

He listen a long time, wholli surrend himself as hi charact 
was, and then stroll homeward in the dusk as the air grew chilly. 

"there wa noth to alarm?" put in dr. silenc briefly. 

"absolut nothing," said vezin; "but you know it wa all so 
fantast and charm that my imagin wa profoundli impressed. 
perhaps, too," he continued, gentli explanatory, "it wa thi stir 
of my imagin that caus other impressions; for, as I walk back, 
the spell of the place began to steal over me in a dozen ways, though 
all intellig ways. but there were other thing I could not account 
for in the least, even then." 

"incidents, you mean?" 

"hardli incidents, I think. A lot of vivid sensat crowd themselv 
upon my mind and I could trace them to no causes. It wa just after 
sunset and the tumbl old build trace magic outlin against an 
opalesc sky of gold and red. the dusk wa run down the twist 
streets. all round the hill the plain press in like a dim sea, it 
level rise with the darkness. the spell of thi kind of scene, you 
know, can be veri moving, and it wa so that night. yet I felt that what 
came to me had noth directli to do with the mysteri and wonder of the 
scene." 

"not mere the subtl transform of the spirit that come with 
beauty," put in the doctor, notic hi hesitation. 

"exactly," vezin went on, duli encourag and no longer so fear of 
our smile at hi expense. "the impress came from somewher else. 
for instance, down the busi main street where men and women were 
bustl home from work, shop at stall and barrows, idli gossip 
in groups, and all the rest of it, I saw that I arous no interest and 
that no one turn to stare at me as a foreign and stranger. I wa 
utterli ignored, and my presenc among them excit no special interest 
or attention. 

"and then, quit suddenly, it dawn upon me with convict that all 
the time thi indiffer and inattent were mere feigned. 
everybodi as a matter of fact wa watch me closely. everi movement I 
made wa known and observed. ignor me wa all a pretence--an 
elabor pretence." 

He paus a moment and look at us to see if we were smiling, and then 
continued, reassured-- 

"it is useless to ask me how I notic this, becaus I simpli cannot 
explain it. but the discoveri gave me someth of a shock. befor I got 
back to the inn, however, anoth curiou thing rose up strongli in my 
mind and forc my recognit of it as true. and this, too, I may as 
well say at once, wa equal inexplic to me. I mean I can onli give 
you the fact, as fact it wa to me." 

the littl man left hi chair and stood on the mat befor the fire. hi 
diffid lessen from now onwards, as he lost himself again in the 
magic of the old adventure. hi eye shone a littl alreadi as he 
talked. 

"well," he went on, hi soft voic rise somewhat with hi excitement, 
"I wa in a shop when it came to me first--though the idea must have 
been at work for a long time subconsci to appear in so complet a 
form all at once. I wa buy socks, I think," he laughed, "and 
struggl with my dread french, when it struck me that the woman in 
the shop did not care two pin whether I bought anyth or not. she wa 
indiffer whether she made a sale or did not make a sale. she wa onli 
pretend to sell. 

"thi sound a veri small and fanci incid to build upon what 
follows. but realli it wa not small. I mean it wa the spark that lit 
the line of powder and ran along to the big blaze in my mind. 

"for the whole town, I suddenli realised, wa someth other than I so 
far saw it. the real activ and interest of the peopl were 
elsewher and otherwis than appeared. their true live lay somewher 
out of sight behind the scenes. their busy- wa but the outward 
semblanc that mask their actual purposes. they bought and sold, and 
ate and drank, and walk about the streets, yet all the while the main 
stream of their exist lay somewher beyond my ken, underground, in 
secret places. In the shop and at the stall they did not care whether 
I purchas their articl or not; at the inn, they were indiffer to 
my stay or going; their life lay remot from my own, spring from 
hidden, mysteri sources, cours out of sight, unknown. It wa all a 
great elabor pretence, assum possibl for my benefit, or possibl 
for purpos of their own. but the main current of their energi ran 
elsewhere. I almost felt as an unwelcom foreign substanc might be 
expect to feel when it ha found it way into the human system and the 
whole bodi organis itself to eject it or to absorb it. the town wa 
do thi veri thing to me. 

"thi bizarr notion present itself forcibl to my mind as I walk 
home to the inn, and I began busili to wonder wherein the true life of 
thi town could lie and what were the actual interest and activ of 
it hidden life. 

"and, now that my eye were partli opened, I notic other thing too 
that puzzl me, first of which, I think, wa the extraordinari silenc 
of the whole place. positively, the town wa muffled. although the 
street were pave with cobbl the peopl move about silently, softly, 
with pad feet, like cats. noth made noise. all wa hushed, 
subdued, muted. the veri voic were quiet, low-pitch like purring. 
noth clamorous, vehement or emphat seem abl to live in the 
drowsi atmospher of soft dream that sooth thi littl hill-town 
into it sleep. It wa like the woman at the inn--an outward repos 
screen intens inner activ and purpose. 

"yet there wa no sign of lethargi or sluggish anywher about it. 
the peopl were activ and alert. onli a magic and uncanni soft 
lay over them all like a spell." 

vezin pass hi hand across hi eye for a moment as though the memori 
had becom veri vivid. hi voic had run off into a whisper so that we 
heard the last part with difficulty. He wa tell a true thing 
obviously, yet someth that he both like and hate telling. 

"I went back to the inn," he continu present in a louder voice, "and 
dined. I felt a new strang world about me. My old world of realiti 
receded. here, whether I like it or no, wa someth new and 
incomprehensible. I regret have left the train so impulsively. An 
adventur wa upon me, and I loath adventur as foreign to my nature. 
moreover, thi wa the begin appar of an adventur somewher 
deep within me, in a region I could not check or measure, and a feel 
of alarm mingl itself with my wonder--alarm for the stabil of what 
I had for forti year recognis as my 'personality.' 

"I went upstair to bed, my mind teem with thought that were unusu 
to me, and of rather a haunt description. By way of relief I kept 
think of that nice, prosaic noisi train and all those wholesome, 
bluster passengers. I almost wish I were with them again. but my 
dream took me elsewhere. I dream of cats, and soft-mov creatures, 
and the silenc of life in a dim muffl world beyond the senses." 


II 

vezin stay on from day to day, indefinitely, much longer than he had 
intended. He felt in a kind of dazed, somnol condition. He did 
noth in particular, but the place fascin him and he could not 
decid to leave. decis were alway veri difficult for him and he 
sometim wonder how he had ever brought himself to the point of 
leav the train. It seem as though some one els must have arrang 
it for him, and onc or twice hi thought ran to the swarthi frenchman 
who had sat opposite. If onli he could have understood that long 
sentenc end so strang with "_à caus du sommeil et à caus de 
chats_." He wonder what it all meant. 

meanwhil the hush soft of the town held him prison and he 
sought in hi muddling, gentl way to find out where the mysteri lay, 
and what it wa all about. but hi limit french and hi constitut 
hatr of activ investig made it hard for him to buttonhol 
anybodi and ask questions. He wa content to observe, and watch, and 
remain negative. 

the weather held on calm and hazy, and thi just suit him. He wander 
about the town till he knew everi street and alley. the peopl suffer 
him to come and go without let or hindrance, though it becam clearer to 
him everi day that he wa never free himself from observation. the town 
watch him as a cat watch a mouse. and he got no nearer to find 
out what they were all so busi with or where the main stream of their 
activ lay. thi remain hidden. the peopl were as soft and 
mysteri as cats. 

but that he wa continu under observ becam more evid from 
day to day. 

for instance, when he stroll to the end of the town and enter a 
littl green public garden beneath the rampart and seat himself upon 
one of the empti bench in the sun, he wa quit alone--at first. not 
anoth seat wa occupied; the littl park wa empty, the path 
deserted. yet, within ten minut of hi coming, there must have been 
fulli twenti person scatter about him, some stroll aimlessli along 
the gravel walks, stare at the flowers, and other seat on the 
wooden bench enjoy the sun like himself. none of them appear to 
take ani notic of him; yet he understood quit well they had all come 
there to watch. they kept him under close observation. In the street 
they had seem busi enough, hurri upon variou errands; yet these 
were suddenli all forgotten and they had noth to do but loll and laze 
in the sun, their duti unremembered. five minut after he left, the 
garden wa again deserted, the seat vacant. but in the crowd street 
it wa the same thing again; he wa never alone. He wa ever in their 
thoughts. 

By degrees, too, he began to see how it wa he wa so cleverli watched, 
yet without the appear of it. the peopl did noth _directly_. 
they behav _obliquely_. He laugh in hi mind as the thought thu 
cloth itself in words, but the phrase exactli describ it. they 
look at him from angl which natur should have led their sight in 
anoth direct altogether. their movement were oblique, too, so far 
as these concern himself. the straight, direct thing wa not their way 
evidently. they did noth obviously. If he enter a shop to buy, the 
woman walk instantli away and busi herself with someth at the 
farther end of the counter, though answer at onc when he spoke, 
show that she knew he wa there and that thi wa onli her way of 
attend to him. It wa the fashion of the cat she followed. even in 
the dining-room of the inn, the be-whisk and courteou waiter, lith 
and silent in all hi movements, never seem abl to come straight to 
hi tabl for an order or a dish. He came by zigzags, indirectly, 
vaguely, so that he appear to be go to anoth tabl altogether, 
and onli turn suddenli at the last moment, and wa there besid him. 

vezin smile curious to himself as he describ how he began to 
realiz these things. other tourist there were none in the hostel, but 
he recal the figur of one or two old men, inhabitants, who took 
their _déjeuner_ and dinner there, and rememb how fantast they 
enter the room in similar fashion. first, they paus in the doorway, 
peer about the room, and then, after a temporari inspection, they 
came in, as it were, sideways, keep close to the wall so that he 
wonder which tabl they were make for, and at the last minut make 
almost a littl quick run to their particular seats. and again he 
thought of the way and method of cats. 

other small incidents, too, impress him as all part of thi queer, 
soft town with it muffled, indirect life, for the way some of the 
peopl appear and disappear with extraordinari swift puzzl him 
exceedingly. It may have been all perfectli natural, he knew, yet he 
could not make it out how the alley swallow them up and shot them 
forth in a second of time when there were no visibl doorway or 
open near enough to explain the phenomenon. onc he follow two 
elderli women who, he felt, had been particularli examin him from 
across the street--quit near the inn thi was--and saw them turn the 
corner a few feet onli in front of him. yet when he sharpli follow on 
their heel he saw noth but an utterli desert alley stretch in 
front of him with no sign of a live thing. and the onli open 
through which they could have escap wa a porch some fifti yard away, 
which not the swiftest human runner could have reach in time. 

and in just such sudden fashion peopl appeared, when he never expect 
them. onc when he heard a great nois of fight go on behind a low 
wall, and hurri up to see what wa go on, what should he see but a 
group of girl and women engag in vocifer convers which 
instantli hush itself to the normal whisper note of the town when 
hi head appear over the wall. and even then none of them turn to 
look at him directly, but slunk off with the most unaccount 
rapid into door and shed across the yard. and their voices, he 
thought, had sound so like, so strang like, the angri snarl of 
fight animals, almost of cats. 

the whole spirit of the town, however, continu to evad him as 
someth elusive, protean, screen from the outer world, and at the 
same time intensely, genuin vital; and, sinc he now form part of 
it life, thi conceal puzzl and irrit him; more--it began 
rather to frighten him. 

out of the mist that slowli gather about hi ordinari surfac 
thoughts, there rose again the idea that the inhabit were wait 
for him to declar himself, to take an attitude, to do this, or to do 
that; and that when he had done so they in their turn would at length 
make some direct response, accept or reject him. yet the vital 
matter concern which hi decis wa await came no nearer to him. 

onc or twice he purpos follow littl process or group of the 
citizen in order to find out, if possible, on what purpos they were 
bent; but they alway discov him in time and dwindl away, each 
individu go hi or her own way. It wa alway the same: he never 
could learn what their main interest was. the cathedr wa ever empty, 
the old church of st. martin, at the other end of the town, deserted. 
they shop becaus they had to, and not becaus they wish to. the 
booth stood neglected, the stall unvisited, the littl _cafés_ 
desolate. yet the street were alway full, the townsfolk ever on the 
bustle. 

"can it be," he thought to himself, yet with a deprec laugh that he 
should have dare to think anyth so odd, "can it be that these peopl 
are peopl of the twilight, that they live onli at night their real 
life, and come out honestli onli with the dusk? that dure the day they 
make a sham though brave pretence, and after the sun is down their true 
life begins? have they the soul of night-things, and is the whole 
bless town in the hand of the cats?" 

the fanci somehow electrifi him with littl shock of shrink and 
dismay. yet, though he affect to laugh, he knew that he wa begin 
to feel more than uneasy, and that strang forc were tug with a 
thousand invis cord at the veri centr of hi being. someth 
utterli remot from hi ordinari life, someth that had not wake for 
years, began faintli to stir in hi soul, send feeler abroad into 
hi brain and heart, shape queer thought and penetr even into 
certain of hi minor actions. someth exceedingli vital to himself, to 
hi soul, hung in the balance. 

and, alway when he return to the inn about the hour of sunset, he saw 
the figur of the townsfolk steal through the dusk from their shop 
doors, move sentry-wis to and fro at the corner of the streets, yet 
alway vanish silent like shadow at hi near approach. and as the 
inn invari close it door at ten o'clock he had never yet found 
the opportun he rather half-heartedli sought to see for himself what 
account the town could give of itself at night. 

"--_à caus du sommeil et à caus de chats_"--th word now rang in hi 
ear more and more often, though still as yet without ani definit 
meaning. 

moreover, someth made him sleep like the dead. 


iii 

It was, I think, on the fifth day--though in thi detail hi stori 
sometim varied--that he made a definit discoveri which increas hi 
alarm and brought him up to a rather sharp climax. befor that he had 
alreadi notic that a chang wa go forward and certain subtl 
transform be brought about in hi charact which modifi 
sever of hi minor habits. and he had affect to ignor them. here, 
however, wa someth he could no longer ignore; and it startl him. 

At the best of time he wa never veri positive, alway neg rather, 
compliant and acquiescent; yet, when necess aros he wa capabl of 
reason vigor action and could take a strongish decision. the 
discoveri he now made that brought him up with such a sharp turn wa 
that thi power had posit dwindl to nothing. He found it 
imposs to make up hi mind. for, on thi fifth day, he realis that 
he had stay long enough in the town and that for reason he could onli 
vagu defin to himself it wa wiser _and safer_ that he should leave. 

and he found that he could not leave! 

thi is difficult to describ in words, and it wa more by gestur and 
the express of hi face that he convey to dr. silenc the state of 
impot he had reached. all thi spi and watching, he said, had as 
it were spun a net about hi feet so that he wa trap and powerless 
to escape; he felt like a fli that had blunder into the intricaci of 
a great web; he wa caught, imprisoned, and could not get away. It wa a 
distress sensation. A numb had crept over hi will till it had 
becom almost incap of decision. the mere thought of vigor 
action--act toward escape--began to terrifi him. all the current of 
hi life had turn inward upon himself, strive to bring to the 
surfac someth that lay buri almost beyond reach, determin to 
forc hi recognit of someth he had long forgotten--forgotten 
year upon years, centuri almost ago. It seem as though a window 
deep within hi be would present open and reveal an entir new 
world, yet somehow a world that wa not unfamiliar. beyond that, again, 
he fanci a great curtain hung; and when that too roll up he would 
see still farther into thi region and at last understand someth of 
the secret life of these extraordinari people. 

"i thi whi they wait and watch?" he ask himself with rather a 
shake heart, "for the time when I shall join them--or refus to join 
them? doe the decis rest with me after all, and not with them?" 

and it wa at thi point that the sinist charact of the adventur 
first realli declar itself, and he becam genuin alarmed. the 
stabil of hi rather fluid littl person wa at stake, he felt, 
and someth in hi heart turn coward. 

whi otherwis should he have suddenli taken to walk stealthily, 
silently, make as littl sound as possible, for ever look behind 
him? whi els should he have move almost on tipto about the passag 
of the practic desert inn, and when he wa abroad have found 
himself deliber take advantag of what cover present itself? 
and why, if he wa not afraid, should the wisdom of stay indoor 
after sundown have suddenli occur to him as emin desirable? why, 
indeed? 

and, when john silenc gentli press him for an explan of these 
things, he admit apologet that he had none to give. 

"it wa simpli that I fear someth might happen to me unless I kept 
a sharp look-out. I felt afraid. It wa instinctive," wa all he could 
say. "I got the impress that the whole town wa after me--want me 
for something; and that if it got me I should lose myself, or at least 
the self I knew, in some unfamiliar state of consciousness. but I am not 
a psychologist, you know," he ad meekly, "and I cannot defin it 
better than that." 

It wa while loung in the courtyard half an hour befor the even 
meal that vezin made thi discovery, and he at onc went upstair to hi 
quiet room at the end of the wind passag to think it over alone. In 
the yard it wa empti enough, true, but there wa alway the possibl 
that the big woman whom he dread would come out of some door, with her 
pretenc of knitting, to sit and watch him. thi had happen sever 
times, and he could not endur the sight of her. He still rememb hi 
origin fancy, bizarr though it was, that she would spring upon him 
the moment hi back wa turn and land with one singl crush leap 
upon hi neck. Of cours it wa nonsense, but then it haunt him, and 
onc an idea begin to do that it ceas to be nonsense. It ha cloth 
itself in reality. 

He went upstair accordingly. It wa dusk, and the oil lamp had not 
yet been lit in the passages. He stumbl over the uneven surfac of 
the ancient flooring, pass the dim outlin of door along the 
corridor--door that he had never onc seen opened--room that seem 
never occupied. He moved, as hi habit now was, stealthili and on 
tiptoe. 

half-way down the last passag to hi own chamber there wa a sharp 
turn, and it wa just here, while grope round the wall with 
outstretch hands, that hi finger touch someth that wa not 
wall--someth that moved. It wa soft and warm in texture, 
indescrib fragrant, and about the height of hi shoulder; and he 
immedi thought of a furry, sweet-smel kitten. the next minut 
he knew it wa someth quit different. 

instead of investigating, however,--hi nerv must have been too 
overwrought for that, he said,--h shrank back as close as possibl 
against the wall on the other side. the thing, whatev it was, slip 
past him with a sound of rustl and, retreat with light footstep 
down the passag behind him, wa gone. A breath of warm, scent air wa 
waft to hi nostrils. 

vezin caught hi breath for an instant and paused, stockstill, half 
lean against the wall--and then almost ran down the remain 
distanc and enter hi room with a rush, lock the door hurriedli 
behind him. yet it wa not fear that made him run: it wa excitement, 
pleasur excitement. hi nerv were tingling, and a delici glow 
made itself felt all over hi body. In a flash it came to him that thi 
wa just what he had felt twenty-f year ago as a boy when he wa in 
love for the first time. warm current of life ran all over him and 
mount to hi brain in a whirl of soft delight. hi mood wa suddenli 
becom tender, melting, loving. 

the room wa quit dark, and he collaps upon the sofa by the window, 
wonder what had happen to him and what it all meant. but the onli 
thing he understood clearli in that instant wa that someth in him 
had swiftly, magic changed: he no longer wish to leave, or to 
argu with himself about leaving. the encount in the passage-way had 
chang all that. the strang perfum of it still hung about him, 
bemus hi heart and mind. for he knew that it wa a girl who had 
pass him, a girl' face that hi finger had brush in the darkness, 
and he felt in some extraordinari way as though he had been actual 
kiss by her, kiss full upon the lips. 

trembling, he sat upon the sofa by the window and struggl to collect 
hi thoughts. He wa utterli unabl to understand how the mere pass 
of a girl in the dark of a narrow passage-way could commun so 
electr a thrill to hi whole be that he still shook with the 
sweet of it. yet, there it was! and he found it as useless to deni 
as to attempt analysis. some ancient fire had enter hi veins, and 
now ran cours through hi blood; and that he wa forty-f instead 
of twenti did not matter one littl jot. out of all the inner turmoil 
and confus emerg the one salient fact that the mere atmosphere, the 
merest casual touch, of thi girl, unseen, unknown in the darkness, had 
been suffici to stir dormant fire in the centr of hi heart, and 
rous hi whole be from a state of feebl sluggish to one of 
tear and tumultu excitement. 

after a time, however, the number of vezin' year began to assert their 
cumul power; he grew calmer, and when a knock came at length upon 
hi door and he heard the waiter' voic suggest that dinner wa 
nearli over, he pull himself togeth and slowli made hi way 
downstair into the dining-room. 

everi one look up as he entered, for he wa veri late, but he took hi 
customari seat in the far corner and began to eat. the trepid wa 
still in hi nerves, but the fact that he had pass through the 
courtyard and hall without catch sight of a petticoat serv to calm 
him a little. He ate so fast that he had almost caught up with the 
current stage of the tabl d'hôte, when a slight commot in the room 
drew hi attention. 

hi chair wa so place that the door and the greater portion of the 
long _sall à manger_ were behind him, yet it wa not necessari to turn 
round to know that the same person he had pass in the dark passag had 
now come into the room. He felt the presenc long befor he heard or saw 
ani one. then he becam awar that the old men, the onli other guests, 
were rise one by one in their places, and exchang greet with 
some one who pass among them from tabl to table. and when at length 
he turn with hi heart beat furious to ascertain for himself, he 
saw the form of a young girl, lith and slim, move down the centr of 
the room and make straight for hi own tabl in the corner. she move 
wonderfully, with sinuou grace, like a young panther, and her approach 
fill him with such delici bewilder that he wa utterli unabl 
to tell at first what her face wa like, or discov what it wa about 
the whole present of the creatur that fill him anew with 
trepid and delight. 

"ah, ma'msel est de retour!" he heard the old waiter murmur at hi 
side, and he wa just abl to take in that she wa the daughter of the 
proprietress, when she wa upon him, and he heard her voice. she wa 
address him. someth of red lip he saw and laugh white teeth, 
and stray wisp of fine dark hair about the temples; but all the rest 
wa a dream in which hi own emot rose like a thick cloud befor hi 
eye and prevent hi see accurately, or know exactli what he 
did. He wa awar that she greet him with a charm littl bow; that 
her beauti larg eye look searchingli into hi own; that the 
perfum he had notic in the dark passag again assail hi nostrils, 
and that she wa bend a littl toward him and lean with one hand 
on the tabl at thi side. she wa quit close to him--that wa the 
chief thing he knew--explain that she had been ask after the 
comfort of her mother' guests, and now wa introduc herself to the 
latest arrival--himself. 

"m'sieur ha alreadi been here a few days," he heard the waiter say; and 
then her own voice, sweet as singing, replied-- 

"ah, but m'sieur is not go to leav us just yet, I hope. My mother is 
too old to look after the comfort of our guest properly, but now I am 
here I will remedi all that." she laugh deliciously. "m'sieur shall be 
well look after." 

vezin, struggl with hi emot and desir to be polite, half rose to 
acknowledg the pretti speech, and to stammer some sort of reply, but as 
he did so hi hand by chanc touch her own that wa rest upon the 
table, and a shock that wa for all the world like a shock of 
electricity, pass from her skin into hi body. hi soul waver and 
shook deep within him. He caught her eye fix upon hi own with a look 
of most curiou intentness, and the next moment he knew that he had sat 
down wordless again on hi chair, that the girl wa alreadi half-way 
across the room, and that he wa tri to eat hi salad with a 
dessert-spoon and a knife. 

long for her return, and yet dread it, he gulp down the 
remaind of hi dinner, and then went at onc to hi bedroom to be 
alon with hi thoughts. thi time the passag were lighted, and he 
suffer no excit contretemps; yet the wind corridor wa dim with 
shadows, and the last portion, from the bend of the wall onwards, 
seem longer than he had ever known it. It ran downhil like the 
pathway on a mountain side, and as he tipto softli down it he felt 
that by right it ought to have led him clean out of the hous into the 
heart of a great forest. the world wa sing with him. strang fanci 
fill hi brain, and onc in the room, with the door secur locked, 
he did not light the candles, but sat by the open window think long, 
long thought that came unbidden in troop to hi mind. 


IV 

thi part of the stori he told to dr. silence, without special coaxing, 
it is true, yet with much stammer embarrassment. He could not in the 
least understand, he said, how the girl had manag to affect him so 
profoundly, and even befor he had set eye upon her. for her mere 
proxim in the dark had been suffici to set him on fire. He 
knew noth of enchantments, and for year had been a stranger to 
anyth approach tender relat with ani member of the opposit 
sex, for he wa encas in shyness, and realis hi overwhelm 
defect onli too well. yet thi bewitch young creatur came to him 
deliberately. her manner wa unmistakable, and she sought him out on 
everi possibl occasion. chast and sweet she wa undoubtedly, yet 
frankli inviting; and she won him utterli with the first glanc of her 
shine eyes, even if she had not alreadi done so in the dark mere by 
the magic of her invis presence. 

"you felt she wa altogeth wholesom and good!" queri the doctor. 
"you had no reaction of ani sort--for instance, of alarm?" 

vezin look up sharpli with one of hi inimit littl apologet 
smiles. It wa some time befor he replied. the mere memori of the 
adventur had suffus hi shi face with blushes, and hi brown eye 
sought the floor again befor he answered. 

"I don't think I can quit say that," he explain presently. "I 
acknowledg certain qualms, sit up in my room afterwards. A 
convict grew upon me that there wa someth about her--how shall I 
express it?--well, someth unholy. It is not impur in ani sense, 
physic or mental, that I mean, but someth quit indefin that 
gave me a vagu sensat of the creeps. she drew me, and at the same 
time repel me, more than--than--" 

He hesitated, blush furiously, and unabl to finish the sentence. 

"noth like it ha ever come to me befor or since," he concluded, 
with lame confusion. "I suppos it was, as you suggest just now, 
someth of an enchantment. At ani rate, it wa strong enough to make 
me feel that I would stay in that aw littl haunt town for year if 
onli I could see her everi day, hear her voice, watch her wonder 
movements, and sometimes, perhaps, touch her hand." 

"can you explain to me what you felt wa the sourc of her power?" john 
silenc asked, look purpos anywher but at the narrator. 

"I am surpris that you should ask me such a question," answer vezin, 
with the nearest approach to digniti he could manage. "I think no man 
can describ to anoth convincingli wherein lie the magic of the woman 
who ensnar him. I certainli cannot. I can onli say thi slip of a girl 
bewitch me, and the mere knowledg that she wa live and sleep in 
the same hous fill me with an extraordinari sens of delight. 

"but there' one thing I can tell you," he went on earnestly, hi eye 
aglow, "namely, that she seem to sum up and synthesis in herself all 
the strang hidden forc that oper so mysteri in the town and 
it inhabitants. she had the silken movement of the panther, go 
smoothly, silent to and fro, and the same indirect, obliqu method as 
the townsfolk, screening, like them, secret purpos of her 
own--purpos that I wa sure had _me_ for their objective. she kept me, 
to my terror and delight, ceaselessli under observation, yet so 
carelessly, so consummately, that anoth man less sensitive, if I may 
say so"--h made a deprec gesture--"or less prepar by what had 
gone before, would never have notic it at all. she wa alway still, 
alway reposeful, yet she seem to be everywher at once, so that I 
never could escap from her. I wa continu meet the stare and 
laughter of her great eyes, in the corner of the rooms, in the 
passages, calmli look at me through the windows, or in the busiest 
part of the public streets." 

their intimacy, it seems, grew veri rapidli after thi first encount 
which had so violent disturb the littl man' equilibrium. He wa 
natur veri prim, and prim folk live mostli in so small a world that 
anyth violent unusu may shake them clean out of it, and they 
therefor instinct distrust originality. but vezin began to forget 
hi prim after awhile. the girl wa alway modestli behaved, and as 
her mother' repres she natur had to do with the guest in 
the hotel. It wa not out of the way that a spirit of camaraderi should 
spring up. besides, she wa young, she wa charmingli pretty, she wa 
french, and--sh obvious like him. 

At the same time, there wa someth indescribable--a certain 
indefin atmospher of other places, other times--that made him tri 
hard to remain on hi guard, and sometim made him catch hi breath 
with a sudden start. It wa all rather like a deliri dream, half 
delight, half dread, he confid in a whisper to dr. silence; and more 
than onc he hardli knew quit what he wa do or saying, as though he 
were driven forward by impuls he scarc recognis as hi own. 

and though the thought of leav present itself again and again to 
hi mind, it wa each time with less insistence, so that he stay on 
from day to day, becom more and more a part of the sleepi life of 
thi dreami mediaev town, lose more and more of hi recognis 
personality. soon, he felt, the curtain within would roll up with an 
aw rush, and he would find himself suddenli admit into the secret 
purpos of the hidden life that lay behind it all. only, by that time, 
he would have becom transform into an entir differ being. 

and, meanwhile, he notic variou littl sign of the intent to 
make hi stay attract to him: flower in hi bedroom, a more 
comfort arm-chair in the corner, and even special littl extra 
dish on hi privat tabl in the dining-room. conversations, too, with 
"mademoisel ilsé" becam more and more frequent and pleasant, and 
although they seldom travel beyond the weather, or the detail of the 
town, the girl, he noticed, wa never in a hurri to bring them to an 
end, and often contriv to interject littl odd sentenc that he never 
properli understood, yet felt to be significant. 

and it wa these stray remarks, full of a mean that evad him, that 
point to some hidden purpos of her own and made him feel uneasy. they 
all had to do, he felt sure, with reason for hi stay on in the town 
indefinitely. 

"and ha m'sieur not even yet come to a decision?" she said softli in 
hi ear, sit besid him in the sunni yard befor _déjeuner_, the 
acquaint have progress with signific rapidity. "because, if 
it' so difficult, we must all tri togeth to help him!" 

the question startl him, follow upon hi own thoughts. It wa 
spoken with a pretti laugh, and a stray bit of hair across one eye, as 
she turn and peer at him half roguishly. possibl he did not quit 
understand the french of it, for her near presenc alway confus hi 
small knowledg of the languag distressingly. yet the words, and her 
manner, and someth els that lay behind it all in her mind, 
frighten him. It gave such point to hi feel that the town wa 
wait for him to make hi mind up on some import matter. 

At the same time, her voice, and the fact that she wa there so close 
besid him in her soft dark dress, thrill him inexpressibly. 

"it is true I find it difficult to leave," he stammered, lose hi way 
delici in the depth of her eyes, "and especi now that 
mademoisel ilsé ha come." 

He wa surpris at the success of hi sentence, and quit delight 
with the littl gallantri of it. but at the same time he could have 
bitten hi tongu off for have said it. 

"then after all you like our littl town, or you would not be pleas to 
stay on," she said, ignor the compliment. 

"I am enchant with it, and enchant with you," he cried, feel that 
hi tongu wa somehow slip beyond the control of hi brain. and he 
wa on the verg of say all manner of other thing of the wildest 
description, when the girl sprang lightli up from her chair besid him, 
and made to go. 

"it is _soup à l'onion_ to-day!" she cried, laugh back at him 
through the sunlight, "and I must go and see about it. otherwise, you 
know, m'sieur will not enjoy hi dinner, and then, perhaps, he will 
leav us!" 

He watch her cross the courtyard, move with all the grace and 
light of the felin race, and her simpl black dress cloth her, he 
thought, exactli like the fur of the same suppl species. she turn 
onc to laugh at him from the porch with the glass door, and then 
stop a moment to speak to her mother, who sat knit as usual in 
her corner seat just insid the hall-way. 

but how wa it, then, that the moment hi eye fell upon thi ungainli 
woman, the pair of them appear suddenli as other than they were? 
whenc came that transform digniti and sens of power that envelop 
them both as by magic? what wa it about that massiv woman that made 
her appear instantli regal, and set her on a throne in some dark and 
dread scenery, wield a sceptr over the red glare of some 
tempestu orgy? and whi did thi slender stripl of a girl, grace 
as a willow, lith as a young leopard, assum suddenli an air of 
sinist majesty, and move with flame and smoke about her head, and the 
dark of night beneath her feet? 

vezin caught hi breath and sat there transfixed. then, almost 
simultan with it appearance, the queer notion vanish again, and 
the sunlight of day caught them both, and he heard her laugh to her 
mother about the _soup à l'onion_, and saw her glanc back at him 
over her dear littl shoulder with a smile that made him think of a 
dew-kiss rose bend lightli befor summer airs. 

and, indeed, the onion soup wa particularli excel that day, becaus 
he saw anoth cover laid at hi small table, and, with flutter 
heart, heard the waiter murmur by way of explan that "ma'msel 
ilsé would honour m'sieur to-day at _déjeuner_, as her custom sometim 
is with her mother' guests." 

So actual she sat by him all through that deliri meal, talk 
quietli to him in easi french, see that he wa well look after, 
mix the salad-dressing, and even help him with her own hand. and, 
later in the afternoon, while he wa smoke in the courtyard, long 
for a sight of her as soon as her duti were done, she came again to 
hi side, and when he rose to meet her, she stood face him a moment, 
full of a perplex sweet shyness befor she spoke-- 

"mi mother think you ought to know more of the beauti of our littl 
town, and _i_ think so too! would m'sieur like me to be hi guide, 
perhaps? I can show him everything, for our famili ha live here for 
mani generations." 

she had him by the hand, indeed, befor he could find a singl word to 
express hi pleasure, and led him, all unresisting, out into the street, 
yet in such a way that it seem perfectli natur she should do so, and 
without the faintest suggest of bold or immodesty. her face 
glow with the pleasur and interest of it, and with her short dress 
and tumbl hair she look everi bit the charm child of seventeen 
that she was, innoc and playful, proud of her nativ town, and aliv 
beyond her year to the sens of it ancient beauty. 

So they went over the town together, and she show him what she 
consid it chief interest: the tumble-down old hous where her 
forebear had lived; the sombre, aristocratic-look mansion where her 
mother' famili dwelt for centuries, and the ancient market-plac where 
sever hundr year befor the witch had been burnt by the score. 
she kept up a live run stream of talk about it all, of which he 
understood not a fiftieth part as he trudg along by her side, curs 
hi forty-f year and feel all the yearn of hi earli manhood 
reviv and jeer at him. and, as she talked, england and surbiton seem 
veri far away indeed, almost in anoth age of the world' history. her 
voic touch someth immeasur old in him, someth that slept 
deep. It lull the surfac part of hi conscious to sleep, 
allow what wa far more ancient to awaken. like the town, with it 
elabor pretenc of modern activ life, the upper layer of hi be 
becam dulled, soothed, muffled, and what lay underneath began to stir 
in it sleep. that big curtain sway a littl to and fro. present it 
might lift altogether.... 

He began to understand a littl better at last. the mood of the town wa 
reproduc itself in him. In proport as hi ordinari extern self 
becam muffled, that inner secret life, that wa far more real and 
vital, assert itself. and thi girl wa sure the high-priestess of 
it all, the chief instrument of it accomplishment. new thoughts, with 
new interpretations, flood hi mind as she walk besid him through 
the wind streets, while the picturesqu old gabl town, softli 
colour in the sunset, had never appear to him so wholli wonder 
and seductive. 

and onli one curiou incid came to disturb and puzzl him, slight in 
itself, but utterli inexplicable, bring white terror into the child' 
face and a scream to her laugh lips. He had mere point to a 
column of blue smoke that rose from the burn autumn leav and made a 
pictur against the red roofs, and had then run to the wall and call 
her to hi side to watch the flame shoot here and there through the 
heap of rubbish. yet, at the sight of it, as though taken by surprise, 
her face had alter dreadfully, and she had turn and run like the 
wind, call out wild sentenc to him as she ran, of which he had not 
understood a singl word, except that the fire appar frighten 
her, and she want to get quickli away from it, and to get him away 
too. 

yet five minut later she wa as calm and happi again as though 
noth had happen to alarm or waken troubl thought in her, and 
they had both forgotten the incident. 

they were lean over the ruin rampart togeth listen to the 
weird music of the band as he had heard it the first day of hi arrival. 
It move him again profoundli as it had done before, and somehow he 
manag to find hi tongu and hi best french. the girl lean across 
the stone close besid him. No one wa about. driven by some 
remorseless engin within he began to stammer something--h hardli knew 
what--of hi strang admir for her. almost at the first word she 
sprang lightli off the wall and came up smile in front of him, just 
touch hi knee as he sat there. she wa hatless as usual, and the 
sun caught her hair and one side of her cheek and throat. 

"oh, i'm so glad!" she cried, clap her littl hand softli in hi 
face, "so veri glad, becaus that mean that if you like me you must 
also like what I do, and what I belong to." 

alreadi he regret bitterli have lost control of himself. someth 
in the phrase of her sentenc chill him. He knew the fear of 
embark upon an unknown and danger sea. 

"you will take part in our real life, I mean," she ad softly, with an 
indescrib coax of manner, as though she notic hi shrinking. 
"you will come back to us." 

alreadi thi slip of a child seem to domin him; he felt her power 
come over him more and more; someth eman from her that stole 
over hi sens and made him awar that her personality, for all it 
simpl grace, held forc that were stately, imposing, august. He saw 
her again move through smoke and flame amid broken and tempestu 
scenery, alarmingli strong, her terribl mother by her side. dimli thi 
shone through her smile and appear of charm innocence. 

"you will, I know," she repeated, hold him with her eyes. 

they were quit alon up there on the ramparts, and the sensat that 
she wa overmast him stir a wild sensuous in hi blood. the 
mingl abandon and reserv in her attract him furiously, and all of 
him that wa man rose up and resist the creep influence, at the 
same time acclaim it with the full delight of hi forgotten youth. An 
irresist desir came to him to question her, to summon what still 
remain to him of hi own littl person in an effort to retain the 
right to hi normal self. 

the girl had grown quiet again, and wa now lean on the broad wall 
close besid him, gaze out across the darken plain, her elbow on 
the coping, motionless as a figur carv in stone. He took hi courag 
in both hands. 

"tell me, ilsé," he said, unconsci imit her own pur 
soft of voice, yet awar that he wa utterli in earnest, "what is 
the mean of thi town, and what is thi real life you speak of? and 
whi is it that the peopl watch me from morn to night? tell me what 
it all means? and, tell me," he ad more quickli with passion in hi 
voice, "what you realli are--yourself?" 

she turn her head and look at him through half-clos eyelids, her 
grow inner excit betray itself by the faint colour that ran 
like a shadow across her face. 

"it seem to me,"--h falter oddli under her gaze--"that I have some 
right to know--" 

suddenli she open her eye to the full. "you love me, then?" she ask 
softly. 

"I swear," he cri impetuously, move as by the forc of a rise tide, 
"I never felt before--i have never known ani other girl who--" 

"then you _have_ the right to know," she calmli interrupt hi confus 
confession, "for love share all secrets." 

she paused, and a thrill like fire ran swiftli through him. her word 
lift him off the earth, and he felt a radiant happiness, follow 
almost the same instant in horribl contrast by the thought of death. He 
becam awar that she had turn her eye upon hi own and wa speak 
again. 

"the real life I speak of," she whispered, "i the old, old life within, 
the life of long ago, the life to which you, too, onc belonged, and to 
which you still belong." 

A faint wave of memori troubl the deep of hi soul as her low voic 
sank into him. what she wa say he knew instinct to be true, 
even though he could not as yet understand it full purport. hi present 
life seem slip from him as he listened, merg hi person in 
one that wa far older and greater. It wa thi loss of hi present self 
that brought to him the thought of death. 

"you came here," she went on, "with the purpos of seek it, and the 
peopl felt your presenc and are wait to know what you decide, 
whether you will leav them without have found it, or whether--" 

her eye remain fix upon hi own, but her face began to change, 
grow larger and darker with an express of age. 

"it is their thought constantli play about your soul that make you 
feel they watch you. they do not watch you with their eyes. the purpos 
of their inner life are call to you, seek to claim you. you were 
all part of the same life long, long ago, and now they want you back 
again among them." 

vezin' timid heart sank with dread as he listened; but the girl' eye 
held him with a net of joy so that he had no wish to escape. she 
fascin him, as it were, clean out of hi normal self. 

"alone, however, the peopl could never have caught and held you," she 
resumed. "the motiv forc wa not strong enough; it ha fade through 
all these years. but i"--sh paus a moment and look at him with 
complet confid in her splendid eyes--"i possess the spell to 
conquer you and hold you: the spell of old love. I can win you back 
again and make you live the old life with me, for the forc of the 
ancient tie between us, if I choos to use it, is irresistible. and I do 
choos to use it. I still want you. and you, dear soul of my dim 
past"--sh press closer to him so that her breath pass across hi 
eyes, and her voic posit sang--"i mean to have you, for you love 
me and are utterli at my mercy." 

vezin heard, and yet did not hear; understood, yet did not understand. 
He had pass into a condit of exaltation. the world wa beneath hi 
feet, made of music and flowers, and he wa fli somewher far abov 
it through the sunshin of pure delight. He wa breathless and giddi 
with the wonder of her words. they intox him. and, still, the 
terror of it all, the dread thought of death, press ever behind her 
sentences. for flame shot through her voic out of black smoke and 
lick at hi soul. 

and they commun with one another, it seem to him, by a process 
of swift telepathy, for hi french could never have compass all he 
said to her. yet she understood perfectly, and what she said to him wa 
like the recit of vers long sinc known. and the mingl pain and 
sweet of it as he listen were almost more than hi littl soul 
could hold. 

"yet I came here wholli by chance--" he heard himself saying. 

"no," she cri with passion, "you came here becaus I call to you. I 
have call to you for years, and you came with the whole forc of the 
past behind you. you had to come, for I own you, and I claim you." 

she rose again and move closer, look at him with a certain insol 
in the face--th insol of power. 

the sun had set behind the tower of the old cathedr and the dark 
rose up from the plain and envelop them. the music of the band had 
ceased. the leav of the plane tree hung motionless, but the chill of 
the autumn even rose about them and made vezin shiver. there wa no 
sound but the sound of their voic and the occasion soft rustl of 
the girl' dress. He could hear the blood rush in hi ears. He 
scarc realis where he wa or what he wa doing. some terribl magic 
of the imagin drew him deepli down into the tomb of hi own being, 
tell him in no unfalt voic that her word shadow forth the 
truth. and thi simpl littl french maid, speak besid him with so 
strang authority, he saw curious alter into quit anoth being. As 
he stare into her eyes, the pictur in hi mind grew and lived, 
dress itself vividli to hi inner vision with a degre of realiti he 
wa compel to acknowledge. As onc before, he saw her tall and 
stately, move through wild and broken sceneri of forest and mountain 
caverns, the glare of flame behind her head and cloud of shift 
smoke about her feet. dark leav encircl her hair, fli loos in 
the wind, and her limb shone through the merest rag of clothing. 
other were about her, too, and ardent eye on all side cast deliri 
glanc upon her, but her own eye were alway for one only, one whom 
she held by the hand. for she wa lead the danc in some tempestu 
orgi to the music of chant voices, and the danc she led circl 
about a great and aw figur on a throne, brood over the scene 
through lurid vapours, while innumer other wild face and form 
crowd furious about her in the dance. but the one she held by the 
hand he knew to be himself, and the monstrou shape upon the throne he 
knew to be her mother. 

the vision rose within him, rush to him down the long year of buri 
time, cri aloud to him with the voic of memori reawakened.... and 
then the scene fade away and he saw the clear circl of the girl' eye 
gaze steadfastli into hi own, and she becam onc more the pretti 
littl daughter of the innkeeper, and he found hi voic again. 

"and you," he whisper tremblingly--"y child of vision and 
enchantment, how is it that you so bewitch me that I love you even 
befor I saw?" 

she drew herself up besid him with an air of rare dignity. 

"the call of the past," she said; "and besides," she ad proudly, "in 
the real life I am a princess--" 

"A princess!" he cried. 

"--and my mother is a queen!" 

At this, littl vezin utterli lost hi head. delight tore at hi heart 
and swept him into sheer ecstasy. To hear that sweet sing voice, and 
to see those ador littl lip utter such things, upset hi balanc 
beyond all hope of control. He took her in hi arm and cover her 
unresist face with kisses. 

but even while he did so, and while the hot passion swept him, he felt 
that she wa soft and loathsome, and that her answer kiss stain 
hi veri soul.... and when, presently, she had freed herself and 
vanish into the darkness, he stood there, lean against the wall in 
a state of collapse, creep with horror from the touch of her yield 
body, and inwardli rage at the weak that he alreadi dimli 
realis must prove hi undoing. 

and from the shadow of the old build into which she disappear 
there rose in the still of the night a singular, long-drawn cry, 
which at first he took for laughter, but which later he wa sure he 
recognis as the almost human wail of a cat. 


V 

for a long time vezin leant there against the wall, alon with hi 
surg thought and emotions. He understood at length that he had done 
the one thing necessari to call down upon him the whole forc of thi 
ancient past. for in those passion kiss he had acknowledg the tie 
of olden days, and had reviv it. and the memori of that soft 
impalp caress in the dark of the inn corridor came back to him 
with a shudder. the girl had first master him, and then led him to the 
one act that wa necessari for her purpose. He had been waylaid, after 
the laps of centuries--caught, and conquered. 

dimli he realis this, and sought to make plan for hi escape. but, 
for the moment at ani rate, he wa powerless to manag hi thought or 
will, for the sweet, fantast mad of the whole adventur mount to 
hi brain like a spell, and he glori in the feel that he wa 
utterli enchant and move in a world so much larger and wilder than 
the one he had ever been accustom to. 

the moon, pale and enormous, wa just rise over the sea-lik plain, 
when at last he rose to go. her slant ray drew all the hous into 
new perspective, so that their roofs, alreadi glisten with dew, 
seem to stretch much higher into the sky than usual, and their gabl 
and quaint old tower lay far away in it purpl reaches. 

the cathedr appear unreal in a silver mist. He move softly, keep 
to the shadows; but the street were all desert and veri silent; the 
door were closed, the shutter fastened. not a soul wa astir. the hush 
of night lay over everything; it wa like a town of the dead, a 
churchyard with gigant and grotesqu tombstones. 

wonder where all the busi life of the day had so utterli disappear 
to, he made hi way to a back door that enter the inn by mean of the 
stables, think thu to reach hi room unobserved. He reach the 
courtyard safe and cross it by keep close to the shadow of the 
wall. He sidl down it, minc along on tiptoe, just as the old men 
did when they enter the _sall à manger_. He wa horrifi to find 
himself do thi instinctively. A strang impuls came to him, 
catch him somehow in the centr of hi body--an impuls to drop upon 
all four and run swiftli and silently. He glanc upward and the idea 
came to him to leap up upon hi window-sil overhead instead of go 
round by the stairs. thi occur to him as the easiest, and most 
natur way. It wa like the begin of some horribl transform 
of himself into someth else. He wa fear strung up. 

the moon wa higher now, and the shadow veri dark along the side of the 
street where he moved. He kept among the deepest of them, and reach 
the porch with the glass doors. 

but here there wa light; the inmates, unfortunately, were still about. 
hope to slip across the hall unobserv and reach the stairs, he 
open the door care and stole in. then he saw that the hall wa 
not empty. A larg dark thing lay against the wall on hi left. At first 
he thought it must be household articles. then it moved, and he thought 
it wa an immens cat, distort in some way by the play of light and 
shadow. then it rose straight up befor him and he saw that it wa the 
proprietress. 

what she had been do in thi posit he could onli ventur a 
dread guess, but the moment she stood up and face him he wa awar 
of some terribl digniti cloth her about that instantli recal the 
girl' strang say that she wa a queen. huge and sinist she stood 
there under the littl oil lamp; alon with him in the empti hall. awe 
stir in hi heart, and the root of some ancient fear. He felt that 
he must bow to her and make some kind of obeisance. the impuls wa 
fierc and irresistible, as of long habit. He glanc quickli about him. 
there wa no one there. then he deliber inclin hi head toward 
her. He bowed. 

"enfin! m'sieur s'est donc décidé. c'est bien alors. j'en sui 
contente." 

her word came to him sonor as through a great open space. 

then the great figur came suddenli across the flag hall at him and 
seiz hi trembl hands. some overpow forc move with her and 
caught him. 

"on pourrait fair un p'tit tour ensemble, n'est-c pas? nou y allon 
cett nuit et il faut s'exerc un peu d'avanc pour cela. ilsé, ilsé, 
vien donc ici. vien vite!" 

and she whirl him round in the open step of some danc that seem 
oddli and horribl familiar. they made no sound on the stones, thi 
strang assort couple. It wa all soft and stealthy. and presently, 
when the air seem to thicken like smoke, and a red glare as of flame 
shot through it, he wa awar that some one els had join them and 
that hi hand the mother had releas wa now tightli held by the 
daughter. ilsé had come in answer to the call, and he saw her with 
leav of vervain twine in her dark hair, cloth in tatter vestig 
of some curiou garment, beauti as the night, and horribly, odiously, 
loathsom seductive. 

"to the sabbath! to the sabbath!" they cried. "on to the witches' 
sabbath!" 

Up and down that narrow hall they danced, the women on each side of him, 
to the wildest measur he had ever imagined, yet which he dimly, 
dread remembered, till the lamp on the wall flicker and went out, 
and they were left in total darkness. and the devil woke in hi heart 
with a thousand vile suggest and made him afraid. 

suddenli they releas hi hand and he heard the voic of the mother 
cri that it wa time, and they must go. which way they went he did not 
paus to see. He onli realis that he wa free, and he blunder 
through the dark till he found the stair and then tore up them to 
hi room as though all hell wa at hi heels. 

He flung himself on the sofa, with hi face in hi hands, and groaned. 
swiftli review a dozen way of immedi escape, all equal 
impossible, he final decid that the onli thing to do for the moment 
wa to sit quiet and wait. He must see what wa go to happen. At 
least in the privaci of hi own bedroom he would be fairli safe. the 
door wa locked. He cross over and softli open the window which gave 
upon the courtyard and also permit a partial view of the hall through 
the glass doors. 

As he did so the hum and murmur of a great activ reach hi ear 
from the street beyond--th sound of footstep and voic muffl by 
distance. He lean out cautious and listened. the moonlight wa clear 
and strong now, but hi own window wa in shadow, the silver disc be 
still behind the house. It came to him irresist that the inhabit 
of the town, who a littl while befor had all been invis behind 
close doors, were now issu forth, busi upon some secret and unholi 
errand. He listen intently. 

At first everyth about him wa silent, but soon he becam awar of 
movement go on in the hous itself. rustl and cheep came to 
him across that still, moonlit yard. A concours of live be sent 
the hum of their activ into the night. thing were on the move 
everywhere. A biting, pungent odour rose through the air, come he knew 
not whence. present hi eye becam glu to the window of the 
opposit wall where the moonshin fell in a soft blaze. the roof 
overhead, and behind him, wa reflect clearli in the pane of glass, 
and he saw the outlin of dark bodi move with long footstep over 
the tile and along the coping. they pass swiftli and silently, shape 
like immens cats, in an endless process across the pictur glass, 
and then appear to leap down to a lower level where he lost sight of 
them. He just caught the soft thud of their leaps. sometim their 
shadow fell upon the white wall opposite, and then he could not make 
out whether they were the shadow of human be or of cats. they 
seem to chang swiftli from one to the other. the transform 
look horribl real, for they leap like human beings, yet chang 
swiftli in the air immedi afterwards, and drop like animals. 

the yard, too, beneath him, wa now aliv with the creep movement of 
dark form all stealthili draw toward the porch with the glass 
doors. they kept so close to the wall that he could not determin 
their actual shape, but when he saw that they pass on to the great 
congreg that wa gather in the hall, he understood that these 
were the creatur whose leap shadow he had first seen reflect in 
the windowpan opposite. they were come from all part of the town, 
reach the appoint meeting-plac across the roof and tiles, and 
spring from level to level till they came to the yard. 

then a new sound caught hi ear, and he saw that the window all about 
him were be softli opened, and that to each window came a face. A 
moment later figur began drop hurriedli down into the yard. and 
these figures, as they lower themselv down from the windows, were 
human, he saw; but onc safe in the yard they fell upon all four and 
chang in the swiftest possibl second into--cats--huge, silent cats. 
they ran in stream to join the main bodi in the hall beyond. 

so, after all, the room in the hous had not been empti and unoccupied. 

moreover, what he saw no longer fill him with amazement. for he 
rememb it all. It wa familiar. It had all happen befor just so, 
hundr of times, and he himself had taken part in it and known the 
wild mad of it all. the outlin of the old build changed, the 
yard grew larger, and he seem to be stare down upon it from a much 
greater height through smoki vapours. and, as he looked, half 
remembering, the old pain of long ago, fierc and sweet, furious 
assail him, and the blood stir horribl as he heard the call of the 
danc again in hi heart and tast the ancient magic of ilsé whirl 
by hi side. 

suddenli he start back. A great lith cat had leap softli up from 
the shadow below on to the sill close to hi face, and wa stare 
fixedli at him with the eye of a human. "come," it seem to say, "come 
with us to the dance! chang as of old! transform yourself swiftli and 
come!" onli too well he understood the creature' soundless call. 

It wa gone again in a flash with scarc a sound of it pad feet 
on the stones, and then other drop by the score down the side of 
the house, past hi veri eyes, all chang as they fell and dart 
away rapidly, softly, toward the gather point. and again he felt the 
dread desir to do likewise; to murmur the old incantation, and then 
drop upon hand and knee and run swiftli for the great fli leap into 
the air. oh, how the passion of it rose within him like a flood, 
twist hi veri entrails, send hi heart' desir flame forth 
into the night for the old, old danc of the sorcer at the witches' 
sabbath! the whirl of the star wa about him; onc more he met the 
magic of the moon. the power of the wind, rush from precipic and 
forest, leap from cliff to cliff across the valleys, tore him 
away.... He heard the cri of the dancer and their wild laughter, and 
with thi savag girl in hi embrac he danc furious about the dim 
throne where sat the figur with the sceptr of majesty.... 

then, suddenly, all becam hush and still, and the fever die down a 
littl in hi heart. the calm moonlight flood a courtyard empti and 
deserted. they had started. the process wa off into the sky. and he 
wa left behind--alone. 

vezin tipto softli across the room and unlock the door. the murmur 
from the streets, grow momentarili as he advanced, met hi ears. He 
made hi way with the utmost caution down the corridor. At the head of 
the stair he paus and listened. below him, the hall where they had 
gather wa dark and still, but through open door and window on the 
far side of the build came the sound of a great throng move farther 
and farther into the distance. 

He made hi way down the creak wooden stairs, dread yet long to 
meet some straggler who should point the way, but find no one; across 
the dark hall, so late throng with living, move things, and out 
through the open front door into the street. He could not believ 
that he wa realli left behind, realli forgotten, that he had been 
purpos permit to escape. It perplex him. 

nervous he peer about him, and up and down the street; then, see 
nothing, advanc slowli down the pavement. 

the whole town, as he went, show itself empti and deserted, as though 
a great wind had blown everyth aliv out of it. the door and window 
of the hous stood open to the night; noth stirred; moonlight and 
silenc lay over all. the night lay about him like a cloak. the air, 
soft and cool, caress hi cheek like the touch of a great furri paw. 
He gain confid and began to walk quickly, though still keep to 
the shadow side. nowher could he discov the faintest sign of the 
great unholi exodu he knew had just taken place. the moon sail high 
over all in a sky cloudless and serene. 

hardli realis where he wa going, he cross the open market-plac 
and so came to the ramparts, whenc he knew a pathway descend to the 
high road and along which he could make good hi escap to one of the 
other littl town that lay to the northward, and so to the railway. 

but first he paus and gaze out over the scene at hi feet where the 
great plain lay like a silver map of some dream country. the still 
beauti of it enter hi heart, increas hi sens of bewilder and 
unreality. No air stirred, the leav of the plane tree stood 
motionless, the near detail were defin with the sharp of day 
against dark shadows, and in the distanc the field and wood melt 
away into haze and shimmer mistiness. 

but the breath caught in hi throat and he stood stockstil as though 
transfix when hi gaze pass from the horizon and fell upon the near 
prospect in the depth of the valley at hi feet. the whole lower slope 
of the hill, that lay hid from the bright of the moon, were aglow, 
and through the glare he saw countless move forms, shift thick and 
fast between the open of the trees; while overhead, like leav 
driven by the wind, he discern fli shape that hover darkli one 
moment against the sky and then settl down with cri and weird 
sing through the branch into the region that wa aflame. 

spellbound, he stood and stare for a time that he could not measure. 
and then, move by one of the terribl impuls that seem to control 
the whole adventure, he climb swiftli upon the top of the broad 
coping, and balanc a moment where the valley gape at hi feet. but in 
that veri instant, as he stood hovering, a sudden movement among the 
shadow of the hous caught hi eye, and he turn to see the outlin 
of a larg anim dart swiftli across the open space behind him, and 
land with a fli leap upon the top of the wall a littl lower down. It 
ran like the wind to hi feet and then rose up besid him upon the 
ramparts. A shiver seem to run through the moonlight, and hi sight 
trembl for a second. hi heart puls fearfully. ilsé stood besid 
him, peer into hi face. 

some dark substance, he saw, stain the girl' face and skin, shine 
in the moonlight as she stretch her hand toward him; she wa dress 
in wretch tatter garment that yet becam her mightily; rue and 
vervain twine about her temples; her eye glitter with unholi light. 
He onli just control the wild impuls to take her in hi arm and 
leap with her from their giddi perch into the valley below. 

"see!" she cried, point with an arm on which the rag flutter in 
the rise wind toward the forest aglow in the distance. "see where 
they await us! the wood are alive! alreadi the great one are there, 
and the danc will soon begin! the salv is here! anoint yourself and 
come!" 

though a moment befor the sky wa clear and cloudless, yet even while 
she spoke the face of the moon grew dark and the wind began to toss in 
the crest of the plane tree at hi feet. stray gust brought the 
sound of hoars sing and cri from the lower slope of the hill, 
and the pungent odour he had alreadi notic about the courtyard of the 
inn rose about him in the air. 

"transform, transform!" she cri again, her voic rise like a song. 
"rub well your skin befor you fly. come! come with me to the sabbath, 
to the mad of it furiou delight, to the sweet abandon of it 
evil worship! see! the great one are there, and the terribl sacrament 
prepared. the throne is occupied. anoint and come! anoint and come!" 

she grew to the height of a tree besid him, leap upon the wall with 
flame eye and hair strewn upon the night. He too began to chang 
swiftly. her hand touch the skin of hi face and neck, streak him 
with the burn salv that sent the old magic into hi blood with the 
power befor which fade all that is good. 

A wild roar came up to hi ear from the heart of the wood, and the 
girl, when she heard it, leap upon the wall in the frenzi of her 
wick joy. 

"satan is there!" she screamed, rush upon him and strive to draw 
him with her to the edg of the wall. "satan ha come. the sacrament 
call us! come, with your dear apost soul, and we will worship and 
danc till the moon die and the world is forgotten!" 

just save himself from the dread plunge, vezin struggl to releas 
himself from her grasp, while the passion tore at hi rein and all but 
master him. He shriek aloud, not know what he said, and then he 
shriek again. It wa the old impulses, the old aw habit 
instinct find voice; for though it seem to him that he mere 
shriek nonsense, the word he utter realli had mean in them, and 
were intelligible. It wa the ancient call. and it wa heard below. It 
wa answered. 

the wind whistl at the skirt of hi coat as the air round him 
darken with mani fli form crowd upward out of the valley. the 
cri of hoars voic smote upon hi ears, come closer. stroke of 
wind buffet him, tear him thi way and that along the crumbl top 
of the stone wall; and ilsé clung to him with her long shine arms, 
smooth and bare, hold him fast about the neck. but not ilsé alone, 
for a dozen of them surround him, drop out of the air. the 
pungent odour of the anoint bodi stifl him, excit him to the 
old mad of the sabbath, the danc of the witch and sorcer do 
honour to the personifi evil of the world. 

"anoint and away! anoint and away!" they cri in wild choru about him. 
"to the danc that never dies! To the sweet and fear fantasi of 
evil!" 

anoth moment and he would have yield and gone, for hi will turn 
soft and the flood of passion memori all but overwhelm him, 
when--so can a small thing after the whole cours of an adventure--h 
caught hi foot upon a loos stone in the edg of the wall, and then 
fell with a sudden crash on to the ground below. but he fell toward the 
houses, in the open space of dust and cobblestones, and fortun not 
into the gape depth of the valley on the farther side. 

and they, too, came in a tumbl heap about him, like fli upon a 
piec of food, but as they fell he wa releas for a moment from the 
power of their touch, and in that brief instant of freedom there flash 
into hi mind the sudden intuit that save him. befor he could 
regain hi feet he saw them scrabbl awkwardli back upon the wall, as 
though bat-lik they could onli fli by drop from a height, and had 
no hold upon him in the open. then, see them perch there in a row 
like cat upon a roof, all dark and singularli shapeless, their eye 
like lamps, the sudden memori came back to him of ilsé' terror at the 
sight of fire. 

quick as a flash he found hi match and lit the dead leav that lay 
under the wall. 

dri and withered, they caught fire at once, and the wind carri the 
flame in a long line down the length of the wall, lick upward as it 
ran; and with shriek and wailings, the crowd row of form upon the 
top melt away into the air on the other side, and were gone with a 
great rush and whir of their bodi down into the heart of the 
haunt valley, leav vezin breathless and shaken in the middl of the 
desert ground. 

"ilsé!" he call feebly; "ilsé!" for hi heart ach to think that she 
wa realli gone to the great danc without him, and that he had lost the 
opportun of it fear joy. yet at the same time hi relief wa so 
great, and he wa so daze and troubl in mind with the whole thing, 
that he hardli knew what he wa saying, and onli cri aloud in the 
fierc storm of hi emotion.... 

the fire under the wall ran it course, and the moonlight came out 
again, soft and clear, from it temporari eclipse. with one last 
shudder look at the ruin ramparts, and a feel of horrid wonder 
for the haunt valley beyond, where the shape still crowd and flew, 
he turn hi face toward the town and slowli made hi way in the 
direct of the hotel. 

and as he went, a great wail of cries, and a sound of howling, 
follow him from the gleam forest below, grow fainter and fainter 
with the burst of wind as he disappear between the houses.

"it may seem rather abrupt to you, thi sudden tame ending," said arthur 
vezin, glanc with flush face and timid eye at dr. silenc sit 
there with hi notebook, "but the fact is--er--from that moment my 
memori seem to have fail rather. I have no distinct recollect of 
how I got home or what precis I did. 

"it appear I never went back to the inn at all. I onli dimli recollect 
race down a long white road in the moonlight, past wood and villages, 
still and deserted, and then the dawn came up, and I saw the tower of a 
biggish town and so came to a station. 

"but, long befor that, I rememb paus somewher on the road and 
look back to where the hill-town of my adventur stood up in the 
moonlight, and think how exactli like a great monstrou cat it lay 
there upon the plain, it huge front paw lie down the two main 
streets, and the twin and broken tower of the cathedr mark it 
torn ear against the sky. that pictur stay in my mind with the utmost 
vivid to thi day. 

"anoth thing remain in my mind from that escape--namely, the sudden 
sharp remind that I had not paid my bill, and the decis I made, 
stand there on the dusti highroad, that the small baggag I had left 
behind would more than settl for my indebtedness. 

"for the rest, I can onli tell you that I got coffe and bread at a café 
on the outskirt of thi town I had come to, and soon after found my way 
to the station and caught a train later in the day. that same even I 
reach london." 

"and how long altogether," ask john silenc quietly, "do you think you 
stay in the town of the adventure?" 

vezin look up sheepishly. 

"I wa come to that," he resumed, with apologet wriggl of hi 
body. "in london I found that I wa a whole week out in my reckon of 
time. I had stay over a week in the town, and it ought to have been 
septemb 15th,--instead of which it wa onli septemb 10th!" 

"so that, in reality, you had onli stay a night or two in the inn?" 
queri the doctor. 

vezin hesit befor replying. He shuffl upon the mat. 

"I must have gain time somewhere," he said at length--"somewher or 
somehow. I certainli had a week to my credit. I can't explain it. I can 
onli give you the fact." 

"and thi happen to you last year, sinc when you have never been back 
to the place?" 

"last autumn, yes," murmur vezin; "and I have never dare to go back. 
I think I never want to." 

"and, tell me," ask dr. silenc at length, when he saw that the littl 
man had evid come to the end of hi word and had noth more to 
say, "had you ever read up the subject of the old witchcraft practic 
dure the middl ages, or been at all interest in the subject?" 

"never!" declar vezin emphatically. "I had never given a thought to 
such matter so far as I know--" 

"or to the question of reincarnation, perhaps?" 

"never--befor my adventure; but I have since," he repli 
significantly. 

there was, however, someth still on the man' mind that he wish to 
reliev himself of by confession, yet could onli with difficulti bring 
himself to mention; and it wa onli after the sympathet tact of 
the doctor had provid numer open that he at length avail 
himself of one of them, and stammer that he would like to show him the 
mark he still had on hi neck where, he said, the girl had touch him 
with her anoint hands. 

He took off hi collar after infinit fumbl hesitation, and lower 
hi shirt a littl for the doctor to see. and there, on the surfac of 
the skin, lay a faint reddish line across the shoulder and extend a 
littl way down the back toward the spine. It certainli indic 
exactli the posit an arm might have taken in the act of embracing. 
and on the other side of the neck, slightli higher up, wa a similar 
mark, though not quit so clearli defined. 

"that wa where she held me that night on the ramparts," he whispered, a 
strang light come and go in hi eyes. 

* * * * * 

It wa some week later when I again found occas to consult john 
silenc concern anoth extraordinari case that had come under my 
notice, and we fell to discuss vezin' story. sinc hear it, the 
doctor had made investig on hi own account, and one of hi 
secretari had discov that vezin' ancestor had actual live for 
gener in the veri town where the adventur came to him. two of 
them, both women, had been tri and convict as witches, and had been 
burn aliv at the stake. moreover, it had not been difficult to prove 
that the veri inn where vezin stay wa built about 1700 upon the spot 
where the funer pyre stood and the execut took place. the town 
wa a sort of headquart for all the sorcer and witch of the 
entir region, and after convict they were burnt there liter by 
scores. 

"it seem strange," continu the doctor, "that vezin should have 
remain ignor of all this; but, on the other hand, it wa not the 
kind of histori that success gener would have been anxiou to 
keep alive, or to repeat to their children. therefor I am inclin to 
think he still know noth about it. 

"the whole adventur seem to have been a veri vivid reviv of the 
memori of an earlier life, caus by come directli into contact with 
the live forc still intens enough to hang about the place, and, by 
a most singular chance, too, with the veri soul who had taken part with 
him in the event of that particular life. for the mother and daughter 
who impress him so strang must have been lead actors, with 
himself, in the scene and practic of witchcraft which at that period 
domin the imagin of the whole country. 

"one ha onli to read the histori of the time to know that these 
witch claim the power of transform themselv into variou 
animals, both for the purpos of disguis and also to convey themselv 
swiftli to the scene of their imaginari orgies. lycanthropy, or the 
power to chang themselv into wolves, wa everywher believ in, and 
the abil to transform themselv into cat by rub their bodi 
with a special salv or ointment provid by satan himself, found equal 
credence. the witchcraft trial abound in evid of such univers 
beliefs." 

dr. silenc quot chapter and vers from mani writer on the subject, 
and show how everi detail of vezin' adventur had a basi in the 
practic of those dark days. 

"but that the entir affair took place subject in the man' own 
consciousness, I have no doubt," he went on, in repli to my questions; 
"for my secretari who ha been to the town to investigate, discov 
hi signatur in the visitors' book, and prove by it that he had 
arriv on septemb 8th, and left suddenli without pay hi bill. He 
left two day later, and they still were in possess of hi dirti 
brown bag and some tourist clothes. I paid a few franc in settlement of 
hi debt, and have sent hi luggag on to him. the daughter wa absent 
from home, but the proprietress, a larg woman veri much as he describ 
her, told my secretari that he had seem a veri strange, absent-mind 
kind of gentleman, and after hi disappear she had fear for a long 
time that he had met with a violent end in the neighbour forest where 
he use to roam about alone. 

"I should like to have obtain a person interview with the daughter 
so as to ascertain how much wa subject and how much actual took 
place with her as vezin told it. for her dread of fire and the sight of 
burn must, of course, have been the intuit memori of her former 
pain death at the stake, and have thu explain whi he fanci more 
than onc that he saw her through smoke and flame." 

"and that mark on hi skin, for instance?" I inquired. 

"mere the mark produc by hyster brooding," he replied, "like 
the stigmata of the _religieuses_, and the bruis which appear on the 
bodi of hypnotis subject who have been told to expect them. thi is 
veri common and easili explained. onli it seem curiou that these mark 
should have remain so long in vezin' case. usual they disappear 
quickly." 

"obvious he is still think about it all, brooding, and live it 
all over again," I ventured. 

"probably. and thi make me fear that the end of hi troubl is not 
yet. We shall hear of him again. It is a case, alas! I can do littl to 
alleviate." 

dr. silenc spoke grave and with sad in hi voice. 

"and what do you make of the frenchman in the train?" I ask 
further--"th man who warn him against the place, _à caus du sommeil 
et à caus de chats?_ sure a veri singular incident?" 

"A veri singular incid indeed," he made answer slowly, "and one I can 
onli explain on the basi of a highli improb coincidence--" 

"namely?" 

"that the man wa one who had himself stay in the town and undergon 
there a similar experience. I should like to find thi man and ask him. 
but the crystal is useless here, for I have no slightest clue to go 
upon, and I can onli conclud that some singular psychic affinity, some 
forc still activ in hi be out of the same past life, drew him thu 
to the person of vezin, and enabl him to fear what might happen 
to him, and thu to warn him as he did. 

"yes," he present continued, half talk to himself, "I suspect in 
thi case that vezin wa swept into the vortex of forc aris out of 
the intens activ of a past life, and that he live over again a 
scene in which he had often play a lead part centuri before. for 
strong action set up forc that are so slow to exhaust themselves, 
they may be said in a sens never to die. In thi case they were not 
vital enough to render the illus complete, so that the littl man 
found himself caught in a veri distress confus of the present and 
the past; yet he wa suffici sensit to recognis that it wa 
true, and to fight against the degrad of returning, even in 
memory, to a former and lower state of development. 

"ah yes!" he continued, cross the floor to gaze at the darken sky, 
and seemingli quit oblivi of my presence, "sublimin up-rush of 
memori like thi can be exceedingli painful, and sometim exceedingli 
dangerous. I onli trust that thi gentl soul may soon escap from thi 
obsess of a passion and tempestu past. but I doubt it, I doubt 
it." 

hi voic wa hush with sad as he spoke, and when he turn back 
into the room again there wa an express of profound yearn upon 
hi face, the yearn of a soul whose desir to help is sometim 
greater than hi power. 




case iii: the nemesi OF fire 


I 

By some mean which I never could fathom, john silenc alway contriv 
to keep the compart to himself, and as the train had a clear run of 
two hour befor the first stop, there wa ampl time to go over the 
preliminari fact of the case. He had telephon to me that veri 
morning, and even through the disguis of the mile of wire the thrill 
of incalcul adventur had sound in hi voice. 

"a if it were an ordinari countri visit," he called, in repli to my 
question; "and don't forgot to bring your gun." 

"with blank cartridges, I suppose?" for I knew hi rigid principl with 
regard to the take of life, and guess that the gun were mere for 
some obviou purpos of disguise. 

then he thank me for coming, mention the train, snap down the 
receiver, and left me, vibrat with the excit of anticipation, to 
do my packing. for the honour of accompani dr. john silenc on one of 
hi big case wa what mani would have consid an empti honour--and 
risky. certainli the adventur held all manner of possibilities, and I 
arriv at waterloo with the feel of a man who is about to embark on 
some danger and peculiar mission in which the danger he expect to 
run will not be the ordinari danger to life and limb, but of some 
secret charact difficult to name and still more difficult to cope 
with. 

"the manor hous ha a high sound," he told me, as we sat with our feet 
up and talked, "but I believ it is littl more than an overgrown 
farmhous in the desol heather countri beyond d----, and it owner, 
colonel wragge, a retir soldier with a tast for books, live there 
practic alone, I understand, with an elderli invalid sister. So you 
need not look forward to a live visit, unless the case provid some 
excit of it own." 

"which is likely?" 

By way of repli he hand me a letter mark "private." It wa date a 
week ago, and sign "your faithfully, horac wragge." 

"he heard of me, you see, through captain anderson," the doctor 
explain modestly, as though hi fame were not almost world-wide; "you 
rememb that indian obsess case--" 

I read the letter. whi it should have been mark privat wa difficult 
to understand. It wa veri brief, direct, and to the point. It refer 
by way of introduct to captain anderson, and then state quit simpli 
that the writer need help of a peculiar kind and ask for a person 
interview--a morn interview, sinc it wa imposs for him to be 
absent from the hous at night. the letter wa dignifi even to the 
point of abruptness, and it is difficult to explain how it manag to 
convey to me the impress of a strong man, shaken and perplexed. 
perhap the restraint of the wording, and the mysteri of the affair had 
someth to do with it; and the refer to the anderson case, the 
horror of which lay still vivid in my memory, may have touch the sens 
of someth rather omin and alarming. but, whatev the cause, there 
wa no doubt that an impress of seriou peril rose somehow out of 
that white paper with the few line of firm writing, and the spirit of a 
deep uneasi ran between the word and reach the mind without ani 
visibl form of expression. 

"and when you saw him--?" I asked, return the letter as the train 
rush clatter noisili through clapham junction. 

"I have not seen him," wa the reply. "the man' mind wa charg to the 
brim when he wrote that; full of vivid mental pictures. notic the 
restraint of it. for the main charact of hi case psychometri could be 
depend upon, and the scrap of paper hi hand ha touch is suffici 
to give to anoth mind--a sensit and sympathet mind--clear mental 
pictur of what is go on. I think I have a veri sound gener idea 
of hi problem." 

"so there may be excitement, after all?" 

john silenc wait a moment befor he replied. 

"someth veri seriou is amiss there," he said gravely, at length. 
"some one--not himself, I gather,--ha been meddl with a rather 
danger kind of gunpowder. so--yes, there may be excitement, as you 
put it." 

"and my duties?" I asked, with a decidedli grow interest. "remember, 
I am your 'assistant.'" 

"behav like an intellig confidenti secretary. observ everything, 
without seem to. say nothing--noth that mean anything. Be present 
at all interviews. I may ask a good deal of you, for if my impress 
are correct thi is--" 

He broke off suddenly. 

"but I won't tell you my impress yet," he resum after a moment' 
thought. "just watch and listen as the case proceeds. form your own 
impress and cultiv your intuitions. We come as ordinari visitors, 
of course," he added, a twinkl show for an instant in hi eye; 
"hence, the guns." 

though disappoint not to hear more, I recognis the wisdom of hi 
word and knew how valueless my impress would be onc the power 
suggest of have heard hi own lay behind them. I likewis reflect 
that intuit join to a sens of humour wa of more use to a man than 
doubl the quantiti of mere "brains," as such. 

befor put the letter away, however, he hand it back, tell me 
to place it against my forehead for a few moment and then describ ani 
pictur that came spontan into my mind. 

"don't deliber look for anything. just imagin you see the insid 
of the eyelid, and wait for pictur that rise against it dark screen." 

I follow hi instructions, make my mind as nearli blank as possible. 
but no vision came. I saw noth but the line of light that pass to 
and fro like the chang of a kaleidoscop across the blackness. A 
momentari sensat of warmth came and went curiously. 

"you see--what?" he ask presently. 

"nothing," I wa oblig to admit disappointedly; "noth but the usual 
flash of light one alway sees. only, perhaps, they are more vivid 
than usual." 

He said noth by way of comment or reply. 

"and they group themselv now and then," I continued, with pain 
candour, for I long to see the pictur he had spoken of, "group 
themselv into globe and round ball of fire, and the line that flash 
about sometim look like triangl and crosses--almost like geometr 
figures. noth more." 

I open my eye again, and gave him back the letter. 

"it make my head hot," I said, feel somehow unworthi for not see 
anyth of interest. but the look in hi eye arrest my attent at 
once. 

"that sensat of heat is important," he said significantly. 

"it wa certainli real, and rather uncomfortable," I replied, hope he 
would expand and explain. "there wa a distinct feel of 
warmth--intern warmth somewhere--oppress in a sense." 

"that is interesting," he remarked, put the letter back in hi 
pocket, and settl himself in the corner with newspap and books. He 
vouchsaf noth more, and I knew the useless of tri to make 
him talk. follow hi exampl I settl likewis with magazin into 
my corner. but when I close my eye again to look for the flash 
light and the sensat of heat, I found noth but the usual 
phantasmagoria of the day' events--faces, scenes, memories,--and in due 
cours I fell asleep and then saw noth at all of ani kind. 

when we left the train, after six hours' travelling, at a littl 
waysid station stand without tree in a world of sand and heather, 
the late octob shadow had alreadi drop their sombr veil upon the 
landscape, and the sun dip almost out of sight behind the moorland 
hills. In a high dogcart, behind a fast horse, we were soon rattl 
across the undul stretch of an open and bleak country, the keen 
air sting our cheek and the scent of pine and bracken strong about 
us. bare hill were faintli visibl against the horizon, and the 
coachman point to a bank of distant shadow on our left where he told 
us the sea lay. occasion stone farmhouses, stand back from the road 
among straggl fir trees, and larg black barn that seem to shift 
past us with a movement of their own in the gloom, were the onli sign 
of human and civilis that we saw, until at the end of a brace 
five mile the light of the lodg gate flare befor us and we plung 
into a thick grove of pine tree that conceal the manor hous up to 
the moment of actual arrival. 

colonel wragg himself met us in the hall. He wa the typic armi 
offic who had seen service, real service, and found himself in the 
process. He wa tall and well built, broad in the shoulders, but lean as 
a greyhound, with grave eyes, rather stern, and a moustach turn 
grey. I judg him to be about sixti year of age, but hi movement 
show a suppl of strength and agil that contradict the years. 
the face wa full of charact and resolution, the face of a man to be 
depend upon, and the straight grey eyes, it seem to me, wore a veil 
of perplex anxieti that he made no attempt to disguise. the whole 
appear of the man at onc cloth the adventur with graviti and 
importance. A matter that gave such a man caus for seriou alarm, I 
felt, must be someth real and of genuin moment. 

hi speech and manner, as he welcom us, were like hi letter, simpl 
and sincere. He had a natur as direct and undevi as a bullet. 
thus, he show plainli hi surpris that dr. silenc had not come 
alone. 

"mi confidenti secretary, mr. hubbard," the doctor said, introduc 
me, and the steadi gaze and power shake of the hand I then receiv 
were well calculated, I rememb thinking, to drive home the impress 
that here wa a man who wa not to be trifl with, and whose perplex 
must spring from some veri real and tangibl cause. and, quit 
obviously, he wa reliev that we had come. hi welcom wa 
unmistak genuine. 

He led us at onc into a room, half library, half smoking-room, that 
open out of the low-ceiling hall. the manor hous gave the 
impress of a rambl and glorifi farmhouse, solid, ancient, 
comfortable, and wholli unpretentious. and so it was. onli the heat of 
the place struck me as unnatural. thi room with the blaze fire may 
have seem uncomfort warm after the long drive through the night 
air; yet it seem to me that the hall itself, and the whole atmospher 
of the house, breath a warmth that hardli belong to well-fil 
grate or the pipe of hot air and water. It wa not the heat of the 
greenhouse; it wa an oppress heat that somehow got into the head and 
mind. It stir a curiou sens of uneasi in me, and I caught 
myself think of the sensat of warmth that had eman from the 
letter in the train. 

I heard him thank dr. silenc for have come; there wa no preamble, 
and the exchang of civil wa of the briefest description. 
evid here wa a man who, like my companion, love action rather 
than talk. hi manner wa straightforward and direct. I saw him in a 
flash: puzzled, worried, harass into a state of alarm by someth he 
could not comprehend; forc to deal with thing he would have prefer 
to despise, yet face it all with dog serious and make no 
attempt to conceal that he felt secretli asham of hi incompetence. 

"so I cannot offer you much entertain beyond that of my own company, 
and the queer busi that ha been go on here, and is still go 
on," he said, with a slight inclin of the head toward me by way of 
includ me in hi confidence. 

"I think, colonel wragge," repli john silenc impressively, "that we 
shall none of us find the time hang heavy. I gather we shall have our 
hand full." 

the two men look at one anoth for the space of some seconds, and 
there wa an indefin qualiti in their silenc which for the first 
time made me admit a swift question into my mind; and I wonder a 
littl at my rash in come with so littl reflect into a big 
case of thi incalcul doctor. but no answer suggest itself, and to 
withdraw was, of course, inconceivable. the gate had close behind me 
now, and the spirit of the adventur wa alreadi besieg my mind with 
it advanc guard of a thousand littl hope and fears. 

explain that he would wait till after dinner to discuss anyth 
serious, as no refer wa ever made befor hi sister, he led the way 
upstair and show us person to our rooms; and it wa just as I wa 
finish dress that a knock came at my door and dr. silenc entered. 

He wa alway what is call a seriou man, so that even in moment of 
comedi you felt he never lost sight of the profound graviti of life, but 
as he came across the room to me I caught the express of hi face 
and understood in a flash that he wa now in hi most grave and earnest 
mood. He look almost troubled. I stop fumbl with my black tie 
and stared. 

"it is serious," he said, speak in a low voice, "more so even than I 
imagined. colonel wragge' control over hi thought conceal a great 
deal in my psychometris of the letter. I look in to warn you to 
keep yourself well in hand--gener speaking." 

"haunt house?" I asked, consciou of a distinct shiver down my back. 

but he smile grave at the question. 

"haunt hous of life more likely," he replied, and a look came into 
hi eye which I had onli seen there when a human soul wa in the toil 
and he wa thick in the fight of rescue. He wa stir in the deeps. 

"colonel wragge--or the sister?" I ask hurriedly, for the gong wa 
sounding. 

"neither directly," he said from the door. "someth far older, 
someth very, veri remot indeed. thi thing ha to do with the ages, 
unless I am mistaken greatly, the age on which the mist of memori have 
long lain undisturbed." 

He came across the floor veri quickli with a finger on hi lips, look 
at me with a peculiar searching of gaze. 

"are you awar yet of anything--odd here?" he ask in a whisper. 
"anyth you cannot quit define, for instance. tell me, hubbard, for I 
want to know all your impressions. they may help me." 

I shook my head, avoid hi gaze, for there wa someth in the eye 
that scare me a little. but he wa so in earnest that I set my mind 
keenli searching. 

"noth yet," I repli truthfully, wish I could confess to a real 
emotion; "noth but the strang heat of the place." 

He gave a littl jump forward in my direction. 

"the heat again, that' it!" he exclaimed, as though glad of my 
corroboration. "and how would you describ it, perhaps?" he ask 
quickly, with a hand on the door knob. 

"it doesn't seem like ordinari physic heat," I said, cast about in 
my thought for a definition. 

"more a mental heat," he interrupted, "a glow of thought and desire, 
a sort of feverish warmth of the spirit. isn't that it?" 

I admit that he had exactli describ my sensations. 

"good!" he said, as he open the door, and with an indescrib 
gestur that combin a warn to be readi with a sign of prais for my 
correct intuition, he wa gone. 

I hurri after him, and found the two men wait for me in front of 
the fire. 

"I ought to warn you," our host wa say as I came in, "that my 
sister, whom you will meet at dinner, is not awar of the real object of 
your visit. she is under the impress that we are interest in the 
same line of study--folklore--and that your research have led to my 
seek acquaintance. she come to dinner in her chair, you know. It 
will be a great pleasur to her to meet you both. We have few visitors." 

So that on enter the dining-room we were prepar to find miss wragg 
alreadi at her place, seat in a sort of bath-chair. she wa a 
vivaci and charm old lady, with smile express and bright 
eyes, and she chat all through dinner with unfail spontaneity. she 
had that face, unlin and fresh, that some peopl carri through life 
from the cradl to the grave; her smooth plump cheek were all pink and 
white, and her hair, still dark, wa divid into two glossi and sleek 
halv on either side of a care parting. she wore gold-rim 
glasses, and at her throat wa a larg scarab of green jasper that made 
a veri handsom brooch. 

her brother and dr. silenc talk little, so that most of the 
convers wa carri on between herself and me, and she told me a 
great deal about the histori of the old house, most of which I fear I 
listen to with but half an ear. 

"and when cromwel stay here," she babbl on, "he occupi the veri 
room upstair that use to be mine. but my brother think it safer for 
me to sleep on the ground floor now in case of fire." 

and thi sentenc ha stay in my memori onli becaus of the sudden way 
her brother interrupt her and instantli led the convers on to 
anoth topic. the pass refer to fire seem to have disturb 
him, and thenceforward he direct the talk himself. 

It wa difficult to believ that thi live and anim old lady, 
sit besid me and take so eager an interest in the affair of 
life, wa practically, we understood, without the use of her lower 
limbs, and that her whole exist for year had been pass between 
the sofa, the bed, and the bath-chair in which she chat so natur 
at the dinner table. she made no allus to her afflict until the 
dessert wa reached, and then, touch a bell, she made us a witti 
littl speech about leav us "like time, on noiseless feet," and wa 
wheel out of the room by the butler and carri off to her apart 
at the other end of the house. 

and the rest of us were not long in follow suit, for dr. silenc and 
myself were quit as eager to learn the natur of our errand as our host 
wa to impart it to us. He led us down a long flag passag to a room 
at the veri end of the house, a room provid with doubl doors, and 
windows, I saw, heavili shuttered. book line the wall on everi side, 
and a larg desk in the bow window wa pile up with volumes, some open, 
some shut, some show scrap of paper stuck between the leaves, and 
all smother in a gener cataract of untidi foolscap and loose-half 
sheets. 

"mi studi and workroom," explain colonel wragge, with a delight 
touch of innoc pride, as though he were a veri seriou scholar. He 
place arm-chair for us round the fire. "here," he ad significantly, 
"we shall be safe from interrupt and can talk securely." 

dure dinner the manner of the doctor had been all that wa natur and 
spontaneous, though it wa imposs for me, know him as I did, not 
to be awar that he wa subconsci veri keenli alert and alreadi 
receiv upon the ultra-sensit surfac of hi mind variou and vivid 
impressions; and there wa now someth in the graviti of hi face, as 
well as in the signific tone of colonel wragge' speech, and 
something, too, in the fact that we three were shut away in thi privat 
chamber about to listen to thing probabl strange, and certainli 
mysterious--someth in all thi that touch my imagin sharpli 
and sent an undeni thrill along my nerves. take the chair 
indic by my host, I lit my cigar and wait for the open of the 
attack, fulli consciou that we were now too far gone in the adventur 
to admit of withdrawal, and wonder a littl anxious where it wa 
go to lead. 

what I expect precisely, it is hard to say. noth definite, perhaps. 
onli the sudden chang wa dramatic. A few hour befor the prosaic 
atmospher of piccadilli wa about me, and now I wa sit in a secret 
chamber of thi remot old build wait to hear an account of thing 
that held possibl the genuin heart of terror. I thought of the dreari 
moor and hill outside, and the dark pine cops sough in the wind 
of night; I rememb my companion' singular word up in my bedroom 
befor dinner; and then I turn and note care the stern 
counten of the colonel as he face us and lit hi big black cigar 
befor speaking. 

the threshold of an adventure, I reflect as I wait for the first 
words, is alway the most thrill moment--until the climax comes. 

but colonel wragg hesitated--mentally--a long time befor he began. He 
talk briefli of our journey, the weather, the country, and other 
compar trivial topics, while he sought about in hi mind for an 
appropri entri into the subject that wa uppermost in the thought of 
all of us. the fact wa he found it a difficult matter to speak of at 
all, and it wa dr. silenc who final show him the way over the 
hedge. 

"mr. hubbard will take a few note when you are ready--y won't 
object," he suggested; "I can give my undivid attent in thi way." 

"bi all means," turn to reach some of the loos sheet on the write 
table, and glanc at me. He still hesit a little, I thought. "the 
fact is," he said apologetically, "I wonder if it wa quit fair to 
troubl you so soon. the daylight might suit you better to hear what I 
have to tell. your sleep, I mean, might be less disturbed, perhaps." 

"I appreci your thoughtfulness," john silenc repli with hi gentl 
smile, take command as it were from that moment, "but realli we are 
both quit immune. there is nothing, I think, that could prevent either 
of us sleeping, except--an outbreak of fire, or some such veri physic 
disturbance." 

colonel wragg rais hi eye and look fixedli at him. thi refer 
to an outbreak of fire I felt sure wa made with a purpose. It certainli 
had the desir effect of remov from our host' manner the last sign 
of hesitancy. 

"forgiv me," he said. "of course, I know noth of your method in 
matter of thi kind--so, perhaps, you would like me to begin at onc 
and give you an outlin of the situation?" 

dr. silenc bow hi agreement. "I can then take my precaut 
accordingly," he ad calmly. 

the soldier look up for a moment as though he did not quit gather the 
mean of these words; but he made no further comment and turn at 
onc to tackl a subject on which he evid talk with diffid 
and unwillingness. 

"it' all so utterli out of my line of things," he began, puf out 
cloud of cigar smoke between hi words, "and there' so littl to tell 
with ani real evid behind it, that it' almost imposs to make a 
consecut stori for you. it' the total cumul effect that is 
so--so disquieting." He chose hi word with care, as though determin 
not to travel one hair' breadth beyond the truth. 

"I came into thi place twenti year ago when my elder brother died," he 
continued, "but could not afford to live here then. My sister, whom you 
met at dinner, kept hous for him till the end, and dure all these 
years, while I wa see servic abroad, she had an eye to the 
place--for we never got a satisfactori tenant--and saw that it wa not 
allow to go to ruin. I myself took possession, however, onli a year 
ago. 

"mi brother," he went on, after a percept pause, "spent much of hi 
time away, too. He wa a great traveller, and fill the hous with 
stuff he brought home from all over the world. the laundry--a small 
detach build beyond the servants' quarters--h turn into a 
regular littl museum. the curio and thing I have clear away--they 
collect dust and were alway get broken--but the laundry-hous you 
shall see tomorrow." 

colonel wragg spoke with such deliber and with so mani paus that 
thi begin took him a long time. but at thi point he came to a full 
stop altogether. evid there wa someth he wish to say that 
cost him consider effort. At length he look up steadili into my 
companion' face. 

"may I ask you--that is, if you won't think it strange," he said, and a 
sort of hush came over hi voic and manner, "whether you have notic 
anyth at all unusual--anyth queer, sinc you came into the house?" 

dr. silenc answer without a moment' hesitation. 

"I have," he said. "there is a curiou sensat of heat in the place." 

"ah!" exclaim the other, with a slight start. "you _have_ notic it. 
thi unaccount heat--" 

"but it cause, I gather, is not in the hous itself--but outside," I 
wa astonish to hear the doctor add. 

colonel wragg rose from hi chair and turn to unhook a frame map 
that hung upon the wall. I got the impress that the movement wa made 
with the deliber purpos of conceal hi face. 

"your diagnosis, I believe, is amazingli accurate," he said after a 
moment, turn round with the map in hi hands. "though, of course, I 
can have no idea how you should guess--" 

john silenc shrug hi shoulder expressively. "mere my 
impression," he said. "if you pay attent to impressions, and do not 
allow them to be confus by deduct of the intellect, you will often 
find them surprisingly, uncannily, accurate." 

colonel wragg resum hi seat and laid the map upon hi knees. hi 
face wa veri thought as he plung abruptli again into hi story. 

"on come into possession," he said, look us altern in the 
face, "I found a crop of stori of the most extraordinari and 
imposs kind I had ever heard--stori which at first I treat with 
amus indifference, but later wa forc to regard seriously, if onli 
to keep my servants. these stori I thought I trace to the fact of my 
brother' death--and, in a way, I think so still." 

He leant forward and hand the map to dr. silence. 

"it' an old plan of the estate," he explained, "but accur enough for 
our purpose, and I wish you would note the posit of the plantat 
mark upon it, especi those near the house. that one," indic 
the spot with hi finger, "i call the twelv acr plantation. It wa 
just there, on the side nearest the house, that my brother and the head 
keeper met their deaths." 

He spoke as a man forc to recognis fact that he deplored, and would 
have prefer to leav untouched--th he person would rather 
have treat with ridicul if possible. It made hi word peculiarli 
dignifi and impressive, and I listen with an increas uneasi 
as to the sort of help the doctor would look to me for later. It seem 
as though I were a spectat of some drama of mysteri in which ani 
moment I might be summon to play a part. 

"it wa twenti year ago," continu the colonel, "but there wa much 
talk about it at the time, unfortunately, and you may, perhaps, have 
heard of the affair. stride, the keeper, wa a passionate, hot-temp 
man but I regret to say, so wa my brother, and quarrel between them 
seem to have been frequent." 

"I do not recal the affair," said the doctor. "may I ask what wa the 
caus of death?" someth in hi voic made me prick up my ear for the 
reply. 

"the keeper, it wa said, from suffocation. and at the inquest the 
doctor aver that both men had been dead the same length of time when 
found." 

"and your brother?" ask john silence, notic the omission, and 
listen intently. 

"equal mysterious," said our host, speak in a low voic with 
effort. "but there wa one distress featur I think I ought to 
mention. for those who saw the face--i did not see it myself--and though 
stride carri a gun it chamber were undischarged--" He stammer 
and hesit with confusion. again that sens of terror move between 
hi words. He stuck. 

"yes," said the chief listen sympathetically. 

"mi brother' face, they said, look as though it had been scorched. It 
had been swept, as it were, by someth that burned--blasted. It was, I 
am told, quit dreadful. the bodi were found lie side by side, face 
downwards, both point away from the wood, as though they had been in 
the act of running, and not more than a dozen yard from it edge." 

dr. silenc made no comment. He appear to be studi the map 
attentively. 

"I did not see the face myself," repeat the other, hi manner somehow 
express the sens of awe he contriv to keep out of hi voice, "but 
my sister unfortun did, and her present state I believ to be 
entir due to the shock it gave to her nerves. she never can be 
brought to refer to it, naturally, and I am even inclin to think that 
the memori ha merci been permit to vanish from her mind. but 
she spoke of it at the time as a face swept by flame--blasted." 

john silenc look up from hi contempl of the map, but with the 
air of one who wish to listen, not to speak, and present colonel 
wragg went on with hi account. He stood on the mat, hi broad 
shoulder hide most of the mantelpiece. 

"they all centr about thi particular plantation, these stories. that 
wa to be expected, for the peopl here are as superstiti as irish 
peasantry, and though I made one or two exampl among them to stop the 
foolish talk, it had no effect, and new version came to my ear everi 
week. you may imagin how littl good dismiss did, when I tell you 
that the servant dismiss themselves. It wa not the hous servants, 
but the men who work on the estat outside. the keeper gave notic 
one after another, none of them with ani reason I could accept; the 
forest refus to enter the wood, and the beater to beat in it. word 
flew all over the countrysid that twelv acr plantat wa a place to 
be avoided, day or night. 

"there came a point," the colonel went on, now well in hi swing, "when 
I felt compel to make investig on my own account. I could not 
kill the thing by ignor it; so I collect and analys the stori 
at first hand. for thi twelv acr wood, you will see by the map, come 
rather near home. it lower end, if you will look, almost touch the 
end of the back lawn, as I will show you tomorrow, and it dens growth 
of pine form the chief protect the hous enjoy from the east wind 
that blow up from the sea. and in olden days, befor my brother 
interf with it and frighten all the game away, it wa one of the 
best pheasant covert on the whole estate." 

"and what form, if I may ask, did thi interfer take?" ask dr. 
silence. 

"in detail, I cannot tell you, for I do not know--except that I 
understand it wa the subject of hi frequent differ with the head 
keeper; but dure the last two year of hi life, when he gave up 
travel and settl down here, he took a special interest in thi 
wood, and for some unaccount reason began to build a low stone wall 
around it. thi wall wa never finished, but you shall see the ruin 
tomorrow in the daylight." 

"and the result of your investigations--thes stories, I mean?" the 
doctor broke in, anxiou to keep him to the main issues. 

"yes, i'm come to that," he said slowly, "but the wood first, for thi 
wood out of which they grew like mushroom ha noth in ani way 
peculiar about it. It is veri thickli grown, and rise to a clearer part 
in the centre, a sort of mound where there is a circl of larg 
boulders--old druid stones, i'm told. At anoth place there' a small 
pond. there' noth distinct about it that I could mention--just an 
ordinari pine-wood, a veri ordinari pine-wood--onli the tree are a bit 
twist in the trunks, some of 'em, and veri dense. noth more. 

"and the stories? well, none of them had anyth to do with my poor 
brother, or the keeper, as you might have expected; and they were all 
odd--such odd things, I mean, to invent or imagine. I never could make 
out how these peopl got such notion into their heads." 

He paus a moment to relight hi cigar. 

"there' no regular path through it," he resumed, puf vigorously, 
"but the field round it are constantli used, and one of the garden 
whose cottag lie over that way declar he often saw move light in 
it at night, and lumin shape like globe of fire over the top of 
the trees, skim and floating, and make a soft hiss sound--most 
of 'em said that, in fact--and anoth man saw shape flit in and 
out among the trees, thing that were neither men nor animals, and all 
faintli luminous. No one ever pretend to see human forms--alway 
queer, huge thing they could not properli describe. sometim the whole 
wood wa lit up, and one fellow--he' still here and you shall see 
him--ha a most circumstanti yarn about have seen great star lie 
on the ground round the edg of the wood at regular intervals--" 

"what kind of stars?" put in john silenc sharply, in a sudden way that 
made me start. 

"oh, I don't know quite; ordinari stars, I think he said, onli veri 
large, and appar blaze as though the ground wa alight. He wa 
too terrifi to go close and examine, and he ha never seen them 
since." 

He stoop and stir the fire into a welcom blaze--welcom for it 
blaze of light rather than for it heat. In the room there wa alreadi a 
strang pervad sensat of warmth that wa oppress in it effect 
and far from comforting. 

"of course," he went on, straighten up again on the mat, "thi wa 
all commonplac enough--thi see light and figur at night. most of 
these fellow drink, and imagin and terror between them may account 
for almost anything. but other saw thing in broad daylight. one of the 
woodmen, a sober, respect man, took the shortcut home to hi midday 
meal, and swore he wa follow the whole length of the wood by 
someth that never show itself, but dodg from tree to tree, alway 
keep out of sight, yet solid enough to make the branch sway and the 
twig snap on the ground. and it made a noise, he declared--but 
really"--th speaker stop and gave a short laugh--"it' too 
absurd--" 

"_please!_" insist the doctor; "for it is these small detail that 
give me the best clue always." 

"--it made a crackl noise, he said, like a bonfire. those were 
hi veri words: like the crackl of a bonfire," finish the soldier, 
with a repetit of hi short laugh. 

"most interesting," dr. silenc observ gravely. "pleas omit nothing." 

"yes," he went on, "and it wa soon after that the fire began--th 
fire in the wood. they start mysteri burn in the patch of 
coars white grass that cover the more open part of the plantation. No 
one ever actual saw them start, but many, myself among the number, 
have seen them burn and smouldering. they are alway small and 
circular in shape, and for all the world like a picnic fire. the head 
keeper ha a dozen explanations, from spark fli out of the hous 
chimney to the sunlight focus through a dewdrop, but none of them, I 
must admit, convinc me as be in the least like or probable. they 
are most singular, I consider, most singular, these mysteri fires, 
and I am glad to say that they come onli at rather long interv and 
never seem to spread. 

"but the keeper had other queer stori as well, and about thing that 
are verifiable. He declar that no life ever willingli enter the 
plantation; more, that no life exist in it at all. No bird nest in 
the trees, or flew into their shade. He set countless traps, but never 
caught so much as a rabbit or a weasel. anim avoid it, and more 
than onc he had pick up dead creatur round the edg that bore no 
obviou sign of how they had met their death. 

"moreover, he told me one extraordinari tale about hi retriev chase 
some invis creatur across the field one day when he wa out with 
hi gun. the dog suddenli point at someth in the field at hi feet, 
and then gave chase, yelp like a mad thing. It follow it imaginari 
quarri to the border of the wood, and then went in--a thing he had 
never known it to do before. the moment it cross the edge--it is 
darkish in there even in daylight--it began fight in the most 
frenzi and terrif fashion. It made him afraid to interfere, he said. 
and at last, when the dog came out, hang it tail down and panting, 
he found someth like white hair stuck to it jaws, and brought it to 
show me. I tell you these detail because--" 

"they are important, believ me," the doctor stop him. "and you have 
it still, thi hair?" he asked. 

"it disappear in the oddest way," the colonel explained. "it wa 
curiou look stuff, someth like asbestos, and I sent it to be 
analys by the local chemist. but either the man got wind of it 
origin, or els he didn't like the look of it for some reason, becaus 
he return it to me and said it wa neither animal, vegetable, nor 
mineral, so far as he could make out, and he didn't wish to have 
anyth to do with it. I put it away in paper, but a week later, on 
open the package--it wa gone! oh, the stori are simpli endless. I 
could tell you hundr all on the same lines." 

"and person experi of your own, colonel wragge?" ask john 
silenc earnestly, hi manner show the greatest possibl interest and 
sympathy. 

the soldier gave an almost impercept start. He look distinctli 
uncomfortable. 

"nothing, I think," he said slowly, "nothing--er--i should like to reli 
on. I mean noth I have the right to speak of, perhaps--yet." 

hi mouth close with a snap. dr. silence, after wait a littl to see 
if he would add to hi reply, did not seek to press him on the point. 

"well," he resum presently, and as though he would speak 
contemptuously, yet dare not, "thi sort of thing ha gone on at 
interv ever since. It spread like wildfire, of course, mysteri 
chatter of thi kind, and peopl began trespass all over the estate, 
come to see the wood, and make themselv a gener nuisance. 
notic of man-trap and spring-gun onli seem to increas their 
persistence; and--think of it," he snorted, "some local research societi 
actual wrote and ask permiss for one of their member to spend a 
night in the wood! bolder fools, who didn't write for leave, came and 
took away bit of bark from the tree and gave them to clairvoyants, who 
invent in their turn a further batch of tales. there wa simpli no end 
to it all." 

"most distress and annoying, I can well believe," interpos the 
doctor. 

"then suddenly, the phenomena ceas as mysteri as they had begun, 
and the interest flagged. the tale stopped. peopl got interest in 
someth else. It all seem to die out. thi wa last july. I can tell 
you exactly, for i'v kept a diari more or less of what happened." 

"ah!" 

"but now, quit recently, within the past three weeks, it ha all 
reviv again with a rush--with a kind of furiou attack, so to speak. 
It ha realli becom unbearable. you may imagin what it means, and the 
gener state of affairs, when I say that the possibl of leav ha 
occur to me." 

"incendiarism?" suggest dr. silence, half under hi breath, but not so 
low that colonel wragg did not hear him. 

"bi jove, sir, you take the veri word out of my mouth!" exclaim the 
astonish man, glanc from the doctor to me and from me to the 
doctor, and rattl the money in hi pocket as though some explan 
of my friend' divin power were to be found that way. 

"it' onli that you are think veri vividly," the doctor said quietly, 
"and your thought form pictur in my mind befor you utter them. it' 
mere a littl elementari thought-reading." 

hi intention, I saw, wa not to perplex the good man, but to impress 
him with hi power so as to ensur obedi later. 

"good lord! I had no idea--" He did not finish the sentence, and 
dive again abruptli into hi narrative. 

"I did not see anyth myself, I must admit, but the stori of 
independ eye-wit were to the effect that line of light, like 
stream of thin fire, move through the wood and sometim were seen to 
shoot out precis as flame might shoot out--in the direct of thi 
house. there," he explained, in a louder voic that made me jump, 
point with a thick finger to the map, "where the westerli fring of 
the plantat come up to the end of the lower lawn at the back of the 
house--wher it link on to those dark patches, which are laurel 
shrubberies, run right up to the back premises--that' where these 
light were seen. they pass from the wood to the shrubberies, and in 
thi way reach the hous itself. like silent rockets, one man 
describ them, rapid as lightn and exceedingli bright." 

"and thi evid you spoke of?" 

"they actual reach the side of the house. they'v left a mark of 
scorch on the walls--th wall of the laundri build at the other 
end. you shall see 'em tomorrow." He point to the map to indic the 
spot, and then straighten himself and glare about the room as though 
he had said someth no one could believ and expect contradiction. 

"scorched--just as the face were," the doctor murmured, look 
significantli at me. 

"scorched--yes," repeat the colonel, fail to catch the rest of the 
sentenc in hi excitement. 

there wa a prolong silenc in the room, in which I heard the gurgl 
of the oil in the lamp and the click of the coal and the heavi 
breath of our host. the most unwelcom sensat were creep about 
my spine, and I wonder whether my companion would scorn me utterli if 
I ask to sleep on the sofa in hi room. It wa eleven o'clock, I saw 
by the clock on the mantelpiece. We had cross the divid line and 
were now well in the movement of the adventure. the fight between my 
interest and my dread becam acute. but, even if turn back had been 
possible, I think the interest would have easili gain the day. 

"I have enemies, of course," I heard the colonel' rough voic break 
into the paus presently, "and have discharg a number of 
servants---" 

"it' not that," put in john silenc briefly. 

"you think not? In a sens I am glad, and yet--ther are some thing 
that can be met and dealt with--" 

He left the sentenc unfinished, and look down at the floor with an 
express of grim sever that betray a momentari glimps of 
character. thi fight man loath and abhor the thought of an 
enemi he could not see and come to grip with. present he move over 
and sat down in the chair between us. someth like a sigh escap him. 
dr. silenc said nothing. 

"mi sister, of course, is kept in ignorance, as far as possible, of all 
this," he said disconnectedly, and as if talk to himself. "but even 
if she knew she would find matter-of-fact explanations. I onli wish I 
could. i'm sure they exist." 

there came then an interv in the convers that wa veri 
significant. It did not seem a real pause, or the silenc real silence, 
for both men continu to think so rapidli and strongli that one almost 
imagin their thought cloth themselv in word in the air of the 
room. I wa more than a littl key up with the strang excit of 
all I had heard, but what stimul my nerv more than anyth els 
wa the obviou fact that the doctor wa clearli upon the trail of 
discovery. In hi mind at that moment, I believe, he had alreadi solv 
the natur of thi perplex psychic problem. hi face wa like a 
mask, and he employ the absolut minimum of gestur and words. all hi 
energi were direct inwards, and by those incalcul method and 
process he had master with such infinit patienc and study, I felt 
sure he wa alreadi in touch with the forc behind these singular 
phenomena and lay hi deep plan for bring them into the open, and 
then effect deal with them. 

colonel wragg meanwhil grew more and more fidgety. from time to time 
he turn toward my companion, as though about to speak, yet alway 
chang hi mind at the last moment. onc he went over and open the 
door suddenly, appar to see if ani one were listen at the 
keyhole, for he disappear a moment between the two doors, and I then 
heard him open the outer one. He stood there for some second and made a 
nois as though he were snif the air like a dog. then he close both 
door cautious and came back to the fireplace. A strang excit 
seem grow upon him. evid he wa tri to make up hi mind to 
say someth that he found it difficult to say. and john silence, as I 
rightli judged, wa wait patient for him to choos hi own 
opportun and hi own way of say it. At last he turn and face 
us, squar hi great shoulders, and stiffen perceptibly. 

dr. silenc look up sympathetically. 

"your own experi help me most," he observ quietly. 

"the fact is," the colonel said, speak veri low, "thi past week 
there have been outbreak of fire in the hous itself. three separ 
outbreaks--and all--in my sister' room." 

"yes," the doctor said, as if thi wa just what he had expect to 
hear. 

"utterli unaccountable--al of them," ad the other, and then sat 
down. I began to understand someth of the reason of hi excitement. 
He wa realis at last that the "natural" explan he had held to 
all along wa becom impossible, and he hate it. It made him angry. 

"fortunately," he went on, "she wa out each time and doe not know. but 
I have made her sleep now in a room on the ground floor." 

"A wise precaution," the doctor said simply. He ask one or two 
questions. the fire had start in the curtains--onc by the window and 
onc by the bed. the third time smoke had been discov by the maid 
come from the cupboard, and it wa found that miss wragge' cloth 
hang on the hook were smouldering. the doctor listen attentively, 
but made no comment. 

"and now can you tell me," he said presently, "what your own feel 
about it is--your gener impression?" 

"it sound foolish to say so," repli the soldier, after a moment' 
hesitation, "but I feel exactli as I have often felt on activ servic 
in my indian campaigns: just as if the hous and all in it were in a 
state of siege; as though a conceal enemi were encamp about us--in 
ambush somewhere." He utter a soft nervou laugh. "a if the next sign 
of smoke would precipit a panic--a dread panic." 

the pictur came befor me of the night shadow the house, and the 
twist pine tree he had describ crowd about it, conceal some 
power enemy; and, glanc at the resolut face and figur of the old 
soldier, forc at length to hi confession, I understood someth of 
all he had been through befor he sought the assist of john silence. 

"and tomorrow, unless I am mistaken, is full moon," said the doctor 
suddenly, watch the other' face for the effect of hi appar 
careless words. 

colonel wragg gave an uncontrol start, and hi face for the first 
time show unmistak pallor. 

"what in the world---?" he began, hi lip quivering. 

"onli that I am begin to see light in thi extraordinari affair," 
return the other calmly, "and, if my theori is correct, each month 
when the moon is at the full should wit an increas in the activ 
of the phenomena." 

"I don't see the connection," colonel wragg answer almost savagely, 
"but I am bound to say my diari bear you out." He wore the most puzzl 
express I have ever seen upon an honest face, but he abhor thi 
addit corrobor of an explan that perplex him. 

"I confess," he repeated, "I cannot see the connection." 

"whi should you?" said the doctor, with hi first laugh that evening. He 
got up and hung the map upon the wall again. "but I do--becaus these 
thing are my special study--and let me add that I have yet to come 
across a problem that is not natural, and ha not a natur explanation. 
it' mere a question of how much one knows--and admits." 

colonel wragg eye him with a new and curiou respect in hi face. but 
hi feel were soothed. moreover, the doctor' laugh and chang of 
manner came as a relief to all, and broke the spell of grave suspens 
that had held us so long. We all rose and stretch our limbs, and took 
littl walk about the room. 

"I am glad, dr. silence, if you will allow me to say so, that you are 
here," he said simply, "veri glad indeed. and now I fear I have kept you 
both up veri late," with a glanc to includ me, "for you must be tired, 
and readi for your beds. I have told you all there is to tell," he 
added, "and tomorrow you must feel perfectli free to take ani step you 
think necessary." 

the end wa abrupt, yet natural, for there wa noth more to say, and 
neither of these men talk for mere talking' sake. 

out in the cold and chilli hall he lit our candl and took us upstairs. 
the hous wa at rest and still, everi one asleep. We move softly. 
through the window on the stair we saw the moonlight fall across 
the lawn, throw deep shadows. the nearer pine tree were just visibl 
in the distance, a wall of impenetr blackness. 

our host came for a moment to our room to see that we had everything. 
He point to a coil of strong rope lie besid the window, fasten to 
the wall by mean of an iron ring. evid it had been recent put 
in. 

"I don't think we shall need it," dr. silenc said, with a smile. 

"I trust not," repli our host gravely. "I sleep quit close to you 
across the landing," he whispered, point to hi door, "and if you--if 
you want anyth in the night you will know where to find me." 

He wish us pleasant dream and disappear down the passag into hi 
room, shade the candl with hi big muscular hand from the draughts. 

john silenc stop me a moment befor I went. 

"you know what it is?" I asked, with an excit that even overcam my 
weariness. 

"yes," he said, "i'm almost sure. and you?" 

"not the smallest notion." 

He look disappointed, but not half as disappoint as I felt. 

"egypt," he whispered, "egypt!" 


II 

noth happen to disturb me in the night--nothing, that is, except a 
nightmar in which colonel wragg chase me amid thin streak of fire, 
and hi sister alway prevent my escap by suddenli rise up out of 
the ground in her chair--dead. the deep bay of dog woke me once, 
just befor the dawn, it must have been, for I saw the window frame 
against the sky; there wa a flash of lightning, too, I thought, as I 
turn over in bed. and it wa warm, for octob oppress warm. 

It wa after eleven o'clock when our host suggest go out with the 
guns, these, we understood, be a somewhat thin disguis for our true 
purpose. personally, I wa glad to be in the open air, for the 
atmospher of the hous wa heavi with presentiment. the sens of 
impend disast hung over all. fear stalk the passages, and lurk 
in the corner of everi room. It wa a hous haunted, but realli 
haunted; not by some vagu shadow of the dead, but by a definit though 
incalcul influenc that wa activ alive, and dangerous. At the 
least smell of smoke the entir household quivered. An odour of burning, 
I wa convinced, would paralys all the inmates. for the servants, 
though professedli ignor by the master' unspoken orders, yet share 
the common dread; and the hideou uncertainty, join with thi display 
of so spite and calcul a spirit of malignity, provid a kind of 
black doom that drape not onli the walls, but also the mind of the 
peopl live within them. 

onli the bright and cheer vision of old miss wragg be push 
about the hous in her noiseless chair, chat and nod briskli to 
everi one she met, prevent us from give way entir to the 
depress which govern the majority. the sight of her wa like a 
gleam of sunshin through the depth of some ill-omen wood, and just 
as we went out I saw her be wheel along by her attend into the 
sunshin of the back lawn, and caught her cheeri smile as she turn her 
head and wish us good sport. 

the morn wa octob at it best. sunshin glisten on the 
dew-drench grass and on leav turn golden-red. the dainti 
messeng of come hoar-frost were alreadi in the air, a search for 
perman winter quarters. from the wide moor that everywher swept up 
against the sky, like a purpl sea splash by the occasion grey of 
rocki clefts, there stole down the cool and perfum wind of the west. 
and the keen tast of the sea ran through all like a master-flavour, 
born over the space perhap by the seagul that cri and circl 
high in the air. 

but our host took littl interest in thi sparkl beauty, and had no 
thought of show off the sceneri of hi property. hi mind wa 
otherwis intent, and, for that matter, so were our own. 

"those bleak moor and hill stretch unbroken for hours," he said, with 
a sweep of the hand; "and over there, some four miles," point in 
anoth direction, "li s---- bay, a long, swampi inlet of the sea, 
haunt by myriad of seabirds. On the other side of the hous are the 
plantat and pine-woods. I thought we would get the dog and go first 
to the twelv acr wood I told you about last night. it' quit near." 

We found the dog in the stable, and I recal the deep bay of the 
night when a fine bloodhound and two great dane leap out to greet us. 
singular companion for guns, I thought to myself, as we struck out 
across the field and the great creatur bound and ran besid us, 
nose to ground. 

the convers wa scanty. john silence' grave face did not encourag 
talk. He wore the express I knew well--that look of earnest 
solicitud which meant that hi whole be wa deepli absorb and 
preoccupied. frightened, I had never seen him, but anxiou often--it 
alway move me to wit it--and he wa anxiou now. 

"on the way back you shall see the laundri building," colonel wragg 
observ shortly, for he, too, found littl to say. "we shall attract 
less attent then." 

yet not all the crisp beauti of the morn seem abl to dispel the 
feel of uneasi dread that gather increasingli about our mind as 
we went. 

In a veri few minut a clump of pine tree conceal the hous from 
view, and we found ourselv on the outskirt of a dens grown 
plantat of conifers. colonel wragg stop abruptly, and, produc 
a map from hi pocket, explain onc more veri briefli it posit 
with regard to the house. He show how it ran up almost to the wall 
of the laundri building--though at the moment beyond our actual 
view--and point to the window of hi sister' bedroom where the fire 
had been. the room, now empty, look straight on to the wood. then, 
glanc nervous about him, and call the dog to heel, he propos 
that we should enter the plantat and make as thorough examin of 
it as we thought worth while. the dogs, he added, might perhap be 
persuad to accompani us a littl way--and he point to where they 
cower at hi feet--but he doubt it. "neither voic nor whip will get 
them veri far, i'm afraid," he said. "I know by experience." 

"if you have no objection," repli dr. silence, with decision, and 
speak almost for the first time, "we will make our examin 
alone--mr. hubbard and myself. It will be best so." 

hi tone wa absolut final, and the colonel acquiesc so polit 
that even a less intuit man than myself must have seen that he wa 
genuin relieved. 

"you doubtless have good reasons," he said. 

"mere that I wish to obtain my impress uncoloured. thi delic 
clue I am work on might be so easili blur by the thought-curr 
of anoth mind with strongli preconceiv ideas." 

"perfectly. I understand," rejoin the soldier, though with an 
express of counten that plainli contradict hi words. "then I 
will wait here with the dogs; and we'll have a look at the laundri on 
our way home." 

I turn onc to look back as we clamber over the low stone wall built 
by the late owner, and saw hi straight, soldierli figur stand in 
the sunlit field watch us with a curious intent look on hi face. 
there wa someth to me incongruous, yet distinctli pathetic, in the 
man' effort to meet all far-fetch explan of the mysteri with 
contempt, and at the same time in hi stolid, unswerv investig 
of it all. He nod at me and made a gestur of farewel with hi hand. 
that pictur of him, stand in the sunshin with hi big dogs, 
steadili watch us, remain with me to thi day. 

dr. silenc led the way in among the twist trunks, plant close 
togeth in serri ranks, and I follow sharp at hi heels. the moment 
we were out of sight he turn and put down hi gun against the root of 
a big tree, and I did likewise. 

"we shall hardli want these cumbersom weapon of murder," he observed, 
with a pass smile. 

"you are sure of your clue, then?" I ask at once, burst with 
curiosity, yet fear to betray it lest he should think me unworthy. 
hi own method were so absolut simpl and untheatrical. 

"I am sure of my clue," he answer gravely. "and I think we have come 
just in time. you shall know in due course. for the present--b content 
to follow and observe. and think, steadily. the support of your mind 
will help me." 

hi voic had that quiet masteri in it which lead men to face death 
with a sort of happi and pride. I would have follow him anywher 
at that moment. At the same time hi word convey a sens of dread 
seriousness. I caught the thrill of hi confidence; but also, in thi 
broad light of day, I felt the measur of alarm that lay behind. 

"you still have no strong impressions?" he asked. "noth happen in 
the night, for instance? No vivid dreamings?" 

He look close for my answer, I wa aware. 

"I slept almost an unbroken sleep. I wa tremend tired, you know, 
and, but for the oppress heat--" 

"good! you still notic the heat, then," he said to himself, rather than 
expect an answer. "and the lightning?" he added, "that lightn out 
of a clear sky--that flashing--did you notic _that_?" 

I answer truli that I thought I had seen a flash dure a moment of 
wakefulness, and he then drew my attent to certain fact befor 
move on. 

"you rememb the sensat of warmth when you put the letter to your 
forehead in the train; the heat gener in the hous last evening, 
and, as you now mention, in the night. you heard, too, the colonel' 
stori about the appear of fire in thi wood and in the hous 
itself, and the way hi brother and the gamekeep came to their death 
twenti year ago." 

I nodded, wonder what in the world it all meant. 

"and you get no clue from these facts?" he asked, a trifl surprised. 

I search everi corner of my mind and imagin for some inkl of 
hi meaning, but wa oblig to admit that I understood noth so far. 

"never mind, you will later. and now," he added, "we will go over the 
wood and see what we can find." 

hi word explain to me someth of hi method. We were to keep our 
mind alert and report to each other the least fanci that cross the 
picture-galleri of our thoughts. then, just as we started, he turn 
again to me with a final warning. 

"and, for your safety," he said earnestly, "imagin _now_--and for that 
matter, imagin alway until we leav thi place--imagin with the 
utmost keenness, that you are surround by a shell that protect you. 
pictur yourself insid a protect envelope, and build it up with the 
most intens imagin you can evoke. pour the whole forc of your 
thought and will into it. believ vividli all through thi adventur 
that such a shell, construct of your thought, will and imagination, 
surround you completely, and that noth can pierc it to attack." 

He spoke with dramat conviction, gaze hard at me as though to 
enforc hi meaning, and then move forward and began to pick hi way 
over the rough, tussocki ground into the wood. and meanwhile, know 
the efficaci of hi prescription, I adopt it to the best of my 
ability. 

the tree at onc close about us like the night. their branch met 
overhead in a continu tangle, their stem crept closer and closer, 
the brambl undergrowth thicken and multiplied. We tore our trousers, 
scratch our hands, and our eye fill with fine dust that made it 
most difficult to avoid the clinging, prickli network of branch and 
creepers. coars white grass that caught our feet like string grew here 
and there in patches. It crown the lump of peati growth that stuck up 
like human heads, fantast dressed, thrust up at us out of the 
ground with crest of dead hair. We stumbl and flounder among them. 
It wa hard going, and I could well conceiv it imposs to find a way 
at all in the night-time. We jumped, when possible, from tussock to 
tussock, and it seem as though we were spring among head on a 
battlefield, and that thi dead white grass conceal eye that turn 
to stare as we passed. 

here and there the sunlight shot in with vivid spot of white light, 
dazzl the sight, but onli make the surround gloom deeper by 
contrast. and on two occas we pass dark circular place in the 
grass where fire had eaten their mark and left a ring of ashes. dr. 
silenc point to them, but without comment and without pausing, and 
the sight of them woke in me a singular realis of the dread that 
lay so far onli just out of sight in thi adventure. 

It wa exhaust work, and heavi going. We kept close together. the 
warmth, too, wa extraordinary. yet it did not seem the warmth of the 
bodi due to violent exertion, but rather an inner heat of the mind that 
laid glow hand of fire upon the heart and set the brain in a kind of 
steadi blaze. when my companion found himself too far in advance, he 
wait for me to come up. the place had evid been untouch by hand 
of man, keeper, forest or sportsman, for mani a year; and my thoughts, 
as we advanc painfully, were not unlik the state of the wood 
itself--dark, confused, full of a haunt wonder and the shadow of 
fear. 

By thi time all sign of the open field behind us were hid. No singl 
gleam penetrated. We might have been grope in the heart of some 
primev forest. then, suddenly, the brambl and tussock and 
stringlik grass came to an end; the tree open out; and the ground 
began to slope upward toward a larg central mound. We had reach the 
middl of the plantation, and befor us stood the broken druid stone 
our host had mentioned. We walk easili up the littl hill, between the 
sparser stems, and, rest upon one of the ivy-cov boulders, look 
round upon a compar open space, as large, perhaps, as a small 
london square. 

think of the ceremoni and sacrific thi rough circl of 
prehistor monolith might have witnessed, I look up into my 
companion' face with an unspoken question. but he read my thought and 
shook hi head. 

"our mysteri ha noth to do with these dead symbols," he said, "but 
with someth perhap even more ancient, and of anoth countri 
altogether." 

"egypt?" I said half under my breath, hopelessli puzzled, but recal 
hi word in my bedroom. 

He nodded. mental I still floundered, but he seem intens 
preoccupi and it wa no time for ask questions; so while hi word 
circl unintellig in my mind I look round at the scene befor me, 
glad of the opportun to recov breath and some measur of composure. 
but hardli had I time to notic the twist and contort shape of mani 
of the pine tree close at hand when dr. silenc lean over and touch 
me on the shoulder. He point down the slope. and the look I saw in hi 
eye key up everi nerv in my bodi to it utmost pitch. 

A thin, almost impercept column of blue smoke wa rise among the 
tree some twenti yard away at the foot of the mound. It curl up and 
up, and disappear from sight among the tangl branch overhead. It 
wa scarc thicker than the smoke from a small brand of burn wood. 

"protect yourself! imagin your shell strongly," whisper the doctor 
sharply, "and follow me closely." 

He rose at onc and move swiftli down the slope toward the smoke, and 
I followed, afraid to remain alone. I heard the soft crunch of our 
step on the pine needles. over hi shoulder I watch the thin blue 
spiral, without onc take my eye off it. I hardli know how to 
describ the peculiar sens of vagu horror inspir in me by the sight 
of that streak of smoke pencil it way upward among the dark trees. 
and the sensat of increas heat as we approach wa phenomenal. It 
wa like walk toward a glow yet invis fire. 

As we drew nearer hi pace slackened. then he stop and pointed, and I 
saw a small circl of burnt grass upon the ground. the tussock were 
blacken and smouldering, and from the centr rose thi line of smoke, 
pale, blue, steady. then I notic a movement of the atmospher besid 
us, as if the warm air were rise and the cooler air rush in to take 
it place: a littl centr of wind in the stillness. overhead the bough 
stir and trembl where the smoke disappeared. otherwise, not a tree 
sighed, not a sound made itself heard. the wood wa still as a 
graveyard. A horribl idea came to me that the cours of natur wa 
about to chang without warning, had chang a littl already, that the 
sky would drop, or the surfac of the earth crash inward like a broken 
bubble. something, certainly, reach up to the citadel of my reason, 
caus it throne to shake. 

john silenc move forward again. I could not see hi face, but hi 
attitud wa plainli one of resolution, of muscl and mind readi for 
vigor action. We were within ten feet of the blacken circl when 
the smoke of a sudden ceas to rise, and vanished. the tail of the 
column disappear in the air above, and at the same instant it seem 
to me that the sensat of heat pass from my face, and the motion of 
the wind wa gone. the calm spirit of the fresh octob day resum 
command. 

side by side we advanc and examin the place. the grass wa 
smouldering, the ground still hot. the circl of burn earth wa a foot 
to a foot and a half in diameter. It look like an ordinari picnic 
fireplace. I bent down cautious to look, but in a second I sprang back 
with an involuntari cri of alarm, for, as the doctor stamp on the 
ash to prevent them spreading, a sound of hiss rose from the spot 
as though he had kick a live creature. thi hiss wa faintli 
audibl in the air. It move past us, away toward the thicker portion 
of the wood in the direct of our field, and in a second dr. silenc 
had left the fire and start in pursuit. 

and then began the most extraordinari hunt of invis I can ever 
conceive. 

He went fast even at the beginning, and, of course, it wa perfectli 
obviou that he wa follow something. To judg by the pois of hi 
head he kept hi eye steadili at a certain level--just abov the height 
of a man--and the consequ wa he stumbl a good deal over the 
rough of the ground. the hiss sound had stopped. there wa no 
sound of ani kind, and what he saw to follow wa utterli beyond me. I 
onli know, that in mortal dread of be left behind, and with a bite 
curios to see whatev there wa to be seen, I follow as quickli as 
I could, and even then bare succeed in keep up with him. 

and, as we went, the whole mad jumbl of the colonel' stori ran 
through my brain, touch a sens of frighten laughter that wa onli 
held in check by the sight of thi earnest, hurri figur befor me. 
for john silenc at work inspir me with a kind of awe. He look so 
diminut among these giant twist trees, while yet I knew that hi 
purpos and hi knowledg were so great, and even in hurri he wa 
dignified. the fanci that we were play some queer, exagger game 
togeth met the fact that we were two men danc upon the brink of 
some possibl tragedy, and the mingl of the two emot in my mind 
wa both grotesqu and terrifying. 

He never turn in hi mad chase, but push rapidli on, while I pant 
after him like a figur in some unreason nightmare. and, as I ran, it 
came upon me that he had been awar all the time, in hi quiet, intern 
way, of mani thing that he had kept for hi own secret consideration; 
he had been watching, waiting, plan from the veri moment we enter 
the shade of the wood. By some inner, concentr process of mind, 
dynam if not actual magical, he had been in direct contact with the 
sourc of the whole adventure, the veri essenc of the real mystery. and 
now the forc were move to a climax. someth wa about to happen, 
someth important, someth possibl dreadful. everi nerve, everi 
sense, everi signific gestur of the plung figur befor me 
proclaim the fact just as sure as the skies, the winds, and the face 
of the earth tell the bird the time to migrat and warn the anim 
that danger lurk and they must move. 

In a few moment we reach the foot of the mound and enter the 
tangl undergrowth that lay between us and the sunlight of the field. 
here the difficulti of fast travel increas a hundredfold. there 
were brambl to dodge, low bough to dive under, and countless tree 
trunk close up to make a direct path impossible. yet dr. silenc 
never seem to falter or hesitate. He went, diving, jumping, dodging, 
ducking, but ever in the same main direction, follow a clean trail. 
twice I trip and fell, and both times, when I pick myself up again, 
I saw him ahead of me, still forc a way like a dog after it quarry. 
and sometimes, like a dog, he stop and pointed--human point it 
was, psychic pointing, and each time he stop to point I heard that 
faint high hiss in the air beyond us. the instinct of an infal 
dowser possess him, and he made no mistakes. 

At length, abruptly, I caught up with him, and found that we stood at 
the edg of the shallow pond colonel wragg had mention in hi account 
the night before. It wa long and narrow, fill with dark brown water, 
in which the tree were dimli reflected. not a rippl stir it 
surface. 

"watch!" he cri out, as I came up. "it' go to cross. it' bound 
to betray itself. the water is it natur enemy, and we shall see the 
direction." 

and, even as he spoke, a thin line like the track of a water-spider, 
shot swiftli across the shini surface; there wa a ghost of steam in the 
air above; and immedi I becam awar of an odour of burning. 

dr. silenc turn and shot a glanc at me that made me think of 
lightning. I began to shake all over. 

"quick!" he cri with excitement, "to the trail again! We must run 
around. it' go to the house!" 

the alarm in hi voic quit terrifi me. without a fals step I dash 
round the slipperi bank and dive again at hi heel into the sea of 
bush and tree trunks. We were now in the thick of the veri dens belt 
that ran around the outer edg of the plantation, and the field wa 
near; yet so dark wa the tangl that it wa some time befor the first 
shaft of white sunlight becam visible. the doctor now ran in zigzags. 
He wa follow someth that dodg and doubl quit wonderfully, 
yet had begun, I fancied, to move more slowli than before. 

"quick!" he cried. "in the light we shall lose it!" 

I still saw nothing, heard nothing, caught no suggest of a trail; yet 
thi man, guid by some interior divin that seem infallible, made 
no fals turns, though how he fail to crash headlong into the tree 
ha remain a mysteri to me ever since. and then, with a sudden rush, 
we found ourselv on the skirt of the wood with the open field lie 
in bright sunshin befor our eyes. 

"too late!" I heard him cry, a note of anguish in hi voice. "it' 
out--and, by god, it' make for the house!" 

I saw the colonel stand in the field with hi dog where we had left 
him. He wa bend double, peer into the wood where he heard us 
running, and he straighten up like a bent whip released. john silenc 
dash passed, call him to follow. 

"we shall lose the trail in the light," I heard him cri as he ran. "but 
quick! We may yet get there in time!" 

that wild rush across the open field, with the dog at our heels, 
leap and barking, and the elderli colonel behind us run as though 
for hi life, shall I ever forget it? though I had onli vagu idea of 
the mean of it all, I put my best foot forward, and, be the 
youngest of the three, I reach the hous an easi first. I drew up, 
panting, and turn to wait for the others. but, as I turned, someth 
move a littl distanc away caught my eye, and in that moment I swear 
I experienc the most overwhelm and singular shock of surpris and 
terror I have ever known, or can conceiv as possible. 

for the front door wa open, and the waist of the hous be narrow, I 
could see through the hall into the dining-room beyond, and so out on to 
the back lawn, and there I saw no less a sight than the figur of miss 
wragge--running. even at that distanc it wa plain that she had seen 
me, and wa come fast toward me, run with the frantic gait of a 
terror-stricken woman. she had recov the use of her legs. 

her face wa a livid grey, as of death itself, but the gener 
express wa one of laughter, for her mouth wa gaping, and her eyes, 
alway bright, shone with the light of a wild merriment that seem the 
merriment of a child, yet wa singularli ghastly. and that veri second, 
as she fled past me into her brother' arm behind, I smelt again most 
unmistak the odour of burning, and to thi day the smell of smoke 
and fire can come veri near to turn me sick with the memori of what I 
had seen. 

fast on her heels, too, came the terrifi attendant, more mistress of 
herself, and abl to speak--which the old ladi could not do--but with a 
face almost, if not quite, as fearful. 

"we were down by the bush in the sun,"--sh gasp and scream in 
repli to colonel wragge' distract questionings,--"i wa wheel the 
chair as usual when she shriek and leaped--i don't know exactly--i wa 
too frighten to see--oh, my god! she jump clean out of the 
chair--_and ran_! there wa a blast of hot air from the wood, and she 
hid her face and jumped. she didn't make a sound--sh didn't cri out, or 
make a sound. she just ran." 

but the nightmar horror of it all reach the break point a few 
minut later, and while I wa still stand in the hall temporarili 
bereft of speech and movement; for while the doctor, the colonel and the 
attend were half-way up the staircase, help the faint woman to 
the privaci of her room, and all in a confus group of dark figures, 
there sound a voic behind me, and I turn to see the butler, hi 
face drip with perspiration, hi eye start out of hi head. 

"the laundry' on fire!" he cried; "the laundri building' a-caught!" 

I rememb hi odd express "a-caught," and want to laugh, but 
find my face rigid and inflexible. 

"the devil' about again, s'help me gawd!" he cried, in a voic thin 
with terror, run about in circles. 

and then the group on the stair scatter as at the sound of a shot, 
and the colonel and dr. silenc came down three step at a time, leav 
the afflict miss wragg to the care of her singl attendant. 

We were out across the front lawn in a moment and round the corner of 
the house, the colonel leading, silenc and I at hi heels, and the 
portli butler puf some distanc in the rear, get more and more 
mix in hi address to god and the devil; and the moment we pass 
the stabl and came into view of the laundri building, we saw a 
wicked-look volum of smoke pour out of the narrow windows, and 
the frighten women-serv and groom run hither and thither, 
call aloud as they ran. 

the arriv of the master restor order instantly, and thi retir 
soldier, poor thinker perhaps, but capabl man of action, had the matter 
in hand from the start. He issu order like a martinet, and, almost 
befor I could realis it, there were stream bucket on the scene and 
a line of men and women form between the build and the stabl pump. 

"inside," I heard john silenc cry, and the colonel follow him through 
the door, while I wa just quick enough at their heel to hear him add, 
"the smoke' the worst part of it. there' no fire yet, I think." 

and, true enough, there wa no fire. the interior wa thick with smoke, 
but it speedili clear and not a singl bucket wa use upon the floor 
or walls. the air wa stifling, the heat fearful. 

"there' preciou littl to burn in here; it' all stone," the colonel 
exclaimed, coughing. but the doctor wa point to the wooden cover of 
the great cauldron in which the cloth were washed, and we saw that 
these were smoulder and charred. and when we sprinkl half a bucket 
of water on them the surround brick hiss and fizz and sent up 
cloud of steam. through the open door and window thi pass out with 
the rest of the smoke, and we three stood there on the brick floor 
stare at the spot and wondering, each in our own fashion, how in the 
name of natur law the place could have caught fire or smoke at all. 
and each wa silent--myself from sheer incapac and befuddlement, the 
colonel from the quiet pluck that face all thing yet speak little, 
and john silenc from the intens mental grappl with thi latest 
manifest of a profound problem that call for concentr of 
thought rather than for ani words. 

there wa realli noth to say. the fact were indisputable. 

colonel wragg wa the first to utter. 

"mi sister," he said briefly, and move off. In the yard I heard him 
send the frighten servant about their busi in an excel 
matter-of-fact voice, scold some one roundli for make such a big 
fire and let the flue get over-heated, and pay no heed to the 
stammer repli that no fire had been lit there for sever days. then 
he dispatch a groom on horseback for the local doctor. 

then dr. silenc turn and look at me. the absolut control he 
possessed, not onli over the outward express of emot by gesture, 
chang of colour, light in the eyes, and so forth, but also, as I well 
knew, over it veri birth in hi heart, the masklik face of the dead he 
could assum at will, made it extrem difficult to know at ani given 
moment what wa at work in hi inner consciousness. but now, when he 
turn and look at me, there wa no sphinx-express there, but 
rather the keen triumphant face of a man who had solv a danger and 
complic problem, and saw hi way to a clean victory. 

"_now_ do you guess?" he ask quietly, as though it were the simplest 
matter in the world, and ignor were impossible. 

I could onli stare stupidli and remain silent. He glanc down at the 
char cauldron-lids, and trace a figur in the air with hi finger. 
but I wa too excited, or too mortified, or still too dazed, perhaps, to 
see what it wa he outlined, or what it wa he meant to convey. I could 
onli go on stare and shake my puzzl head. 

"A fire-elemental," he cried, "a fire-element of the most power and 
malign kind--" 

"A what?" thunder the voic of colonel wragg behind us, have 
return suddenli and overheard. 

"it' a fire-elemental," repeat dr. silenc more calmly, but with a 
note of triumph in hi voic he could not keep out, "and a 
fire-element enraged." 

the light began to dawn in my mind at last. but the colonel--who had 
never heard the term before, and wa besid feel consider work 
up for a plain man with all thi mysteri he knew not how to grappl 
with--th colonel stood, with the most dumfound look ever seen on a 
human countenance, and continu to roar, and stammer, and stare. 

"and why," he began, savag with the desir to find someth visibl he 
could fight--"why, in the name of all the blazes--?" and then stop as 
john silenc move up and took hi arm. 

"there, my dear colonel wragge," he said gently, "you touch the heart of 
the whole thing. you ask 'why.' that is precis our problem." He held 
the soldier' eye firmli with hi own. "and that, too, I think, we 
shall soon know. come and let us talk over a plan of action--that room 
with the doubl doors, perhaps." 

the word "action" calm him a little, and he led the way, without 
further speech, back into the house, and down the long stone passag to 
the room where we had heard hi stori on the night of our arrival. I 
understood from the doctor' glanc that my presenc would not make the 
interview easier for our host, and I went upstair to my own 
room--shaking. 

but in the solitud of my room the vivid memori of the last hour 
reviv so mercilessli that I began to feel I should never in my whole 
life lose the dread pictur of miss wragg running--that dread 
human climax after all the non-human mysteri in the wood--and I wa not 
sorri when a servant knock at my door and said that colonel wragg 
would be glad if I would join them in the littl smoking-room. 

"I think it is better you should be present," wa all colonel wragg 
said as I enter the room. I took the chair with my back to the window. 
there wa still an hour befor lunch, though I imagin that the usual 
divis of the day hardli found a place in the thought of ani one of 
us. 

the atmospher of the room wa what I might call electric. the colonel 
wa posit bristling; he stood with hi back to the fire, finger 
an unlit black cigar, hi face flushed, hi be obvious rous and 
readi for action. He hate thi mystery. It wa poison to hi nature, 
and he long to meet someth face to face--someth he could gaug 
and fight. dr. silence, I notic at once, wa sit befor the map of 
the estat which wa spread upon a table. I knew by hi express the 
state of hi mind. He wa in the thick of it all, knew it, delight in 
it, and wa work at high pressure. He recognis my presenc with a 
lift eyelid, and the flash of the eye, contrast with hi still 
and composure, told me volumes. 

"I wa about to explain to our host briefli what seem to me afoot in 
all thi business," he said without look up, "when he ask that you 
should join us so that we can all work together." and, while signifi 
my assent, I caught myself wonder what qualiti it wa in the calm 
speech of thi undemonstr man that wa so full of power, so charg 
with the strange, viril person behind it and that seem to 
inspir us with hi own confid as by a process of radiation. 

"mr. hubbard," he went on gravely, turn to the soldier, "know 
someth of my methods, and in more than one--er--interest situat 
ha prove of assistance. what we want now"--and here he suddenli got up 
and took hi place on the mat besid the colonel, and look hard at 
him--"i men who have self-control, who are sure of themselves, whose 
mind at the critic moment will emit posit forces, instead of the 
waver and uncertain current due to neg feelings--due, for 
instance, to fear." 

He look at us each in turn. colonel wragg move hi feet farther 
apart, and squar hi shoulders; and I felt guilti but said nothing, 
consciou that my latent store of courag wa be deliber haul 
to the front. He wa wind me up like a clock. 

"so that, in what is yet to come," continu our leader, "each of us 
will contribut hi share of power, and ensur success for my plan." 

"i'm not afraid of anyth I can _see_," said the colonel bluntly. 

"i'm ready," I heard myself say, as it were automatically, "for 
anything," and then added, feel the declar wa lame 
insufficient, "and everything." 

dr. silenc left the mat and began walk to and fro about the room, 
both hand plung deep into the pocket of hi shooting-jacket. 
tremend vital stream from him. I never took my eye off the 
small, move figure; small yes,--and yet somehow make me think of a 
giant plot the destruct of worlds. and hi manner wa gentle, as 
always, sooth almost, and hi word utter quietli without emphasi 
or emotion. most of what he said wa addressed, though not too 
obviously, to the colonel. 

"the violenc of thi sudden attack," he said softly, pace to and fro 
beneath the bookcas at the end of the room, "i due, of course, partli 
to the fact that tonight the moon is at the full"--her he glanc at me 
for a moment--"and partli to the fact that we have all been so 
deliber concentr upon the matter. our thinking, our 
investigation, ha stir it into unusu activity. I mean that the 
intellig forc behind these manifest ha realis that some one 
is busi about it destruction. and it is now on the defensive: more, 
it is aggressive." 

"but 'it'--what is 'it'?" began the soldier, fuming. "what, in the name 
of all that' dreadful, _is_ a fire-elemental?" 

"I cannot give you at thi moment," repli dr. silence, turn to him, 
but undisturb by the interruption, "a lectur on the natur and 
histori of magic, but can onli say that an element is the activ forc 
behind the elements,--wheth earth, air, water, _or fire_,--it is 
imperson in it essenti nature, but can be focused, personified, 
ensouled, so to say, by those who know how--bi magicians, if you 
will--for certain purpos of their own, much in the same way that steam 
and electr can be har by the practic man of thi century. 

"alone, these blind element energi can accomplish little, but 
govern and direct by the train will of a power manipul they 
may becom potent activ for good or evil. they are the basi of all 
magic, and it is the motiv behind them that constitut the magic 
'black' or 'white'; they can be the vehicl of curs or of blessings, 
for a curs is noth more than the thought of a violent will 
perpetuated. and in such cases--cas like this--th conscious, 
direct will of the mind that is use the element stand alway 
behind the phenomena--" 

"you think that my brother--!" broke in the colonel, aghast. 

"ha noth whatev to do with it--directly. the fire-element that 
ha here been torment you and your household wa sent upon it 
mission long befor you, or your family, or your ancestors, or even the 
nation you belong to--unless I am much mistaken--wa even in existence. 
We will come to that a littl later; after the experi I propos to 
make we shall be more positive. At present I can onli say we have to 
deal now, not onli with the phenomenon of attack fire merely, but 
with the vindict and enrag intellig that is direct it from 
behind the scenes--vindict and enraged,"--h repeat the words. 

"that explains--" began colonel wragge, seek furious for word he 
could not find quickli enough. 

"much," said john silence, with a gestur to restrain him. 

He stop a moment in the middl of hi walk, and a deep silenc came 
down over the littl room. through the window the sunlight seem less 
bright, the long line of dark hill less friendly, make me think of a 
vast wave tower to heaven and about to break and overwhelm us. 
someth formid had crept into the world about us. for, 
undoubtedly, there wa a disquiet thought, hold terror as well as 
awe, in the pictur hi word conjur up: the concept of a human 
will reach it deathless hand, spite and destructive, down through 
the ages, to strike the live and afflict the innocent. 

"but what is it object?" burst out the soldier, unabl to restrain 
himself longer in the silence. "whi doe it come from that plantation? 
and whi should it attack us, or ani one in particular?" question began 
to pour from him in a stream. 

"all in good time," the doctor answer quietly, have let him run on 
for sever minutes. "but I must first discov posit what, or who, 
it is that direct thi particular fire-elemental. and, to do that, we 
must first"--h spoke with slow deliberation--"seek to capture--to 
confin by visibility--to limit it sphere in a concret form." 

"good heaven almighty!" exclaim the soldier, mix hi word in hi 
unfeign surprise. 

"quit so," pursu the other calmly; "for in so do I think we can 
releas it from the purpos that bind it, restor it to it normal 
condit of latent fire, and also"--h lower hi voic percept 
--"also discov the face and form of the be that ensoul it." 

"the man behind the gun!" cri the colonel, begin to understand 
something, and lean forward so as not to miss a singl syllable. 

"I mean that in the last resort, befor it return to the womb of 
potenti fire, it will probabl assum the face and figur of it 
director, of the man of magic knowledg who origin bound it with 
hi incant and sent it forth upon it mission of centuries." 

the soldier sat down and gasp openli in hi face, breath hard; but 
it wa a veri subdu voic that frame the question. 

"and how do you propos to make it visible? how captur and confin it? 
what d'ye mean, dr. john silence?" 

"bi furnish it with the materi for a form. By the process of 
materialis simply. onc limit by dimensions, it will becom slow, 
heavy, visible. We can then dissip it. invis fire, you see, is 
danger and incalculable; lock up in a form we can perhap manag 
it. We must betray it--to it death." 

"and thi material?" we ask in the same breath, although I think I had 
alreadi guessed. 

"not pleasant, but effective," came the quiet reply; "the exhal of 
freshli spill blood." 

"not human blood!" cri colonel wragge, start up from hi chair with 
a voic like an explosion. I thought hi eye would start from their 
sockets. 

the face of dr. silenc relax in spite of himself, and hi spontan 
littl laugh brought a welcom though momentari relief. 

"the day of human sacrifice, I hope, will never come again," he 
explained. "anim blood will answer the purpose, and we can make the 
experi as pleasant as possible. only, the blood must be freshli 
spill and strong with the vital eman that attract thi peculiar 
class of element creature. perhaps--perhap if some pig on the estat 
is readi for the market--" 

He turn to hide a smile; but the pass touch of comedi found no echo 
in the mind of our host, who did not understand how to chang quickli 
from one emot to another. clearli he wa debat mani thing 
labori in hi honest brain. but, in the end, the earnest and 
scientif disinterested of the doctor, whose influenc over him wa 
alreadi veri great, won the day, and he present look up more calmly, 
and observ shortli that he thought perhap the matter could be 
arranged. 

"there are other and pleasant methods," dr. silenc went on to 
explain, "but they requir time and preparation, and thing have gone 
much too far, in my opinion, to admit of delay. and the process need 
caus you no distress: we sit round the bowl and await results. noth 
more. the eman of blood--which, as levi says, is the first 
incarn of the univers fluid--furnish the materi out of which 
the creatur of discarn life, spirit if you prefer, can fashion 
themselv a temporari appearance. the process is old, and lie at the 
root of all blood sacrifice. It wa known to the priest of baal, and it 
is known to the modern ecstasi dancer who cut themselv to produc 
object phantom who danc with them. and the least gift clairvoy 
could tell you that the form to be seen in the vicin of 
slaughter-houses, or hover abov the desert battlefields, 
are--well, simpli beyond all description. I do not mean," he added, 
notic the uneasi fidget of hi host, "that anyth in our 
laundry-experi need appear to terrifi us, for thi case seem a 
compar simpl one, and it is onli the vindict charact of the 
intellig direct thi fire-element that caus anxieti and make 
for person danger." 

"it is curious," said the colonel, with a sudden rush of words, draw 
a deep breath, and as though speak of thing distast to him, 
"that dure my year among the hill tribe of northern india I came 
across--person came across--inst of the sacrific of blood to 
certain deiti be stop suddenly, and all manner of disast 
happen until they were resumed. fire broke out in the huts, and even 
on the clothes, of the natives--and--and I admit I have read, in the 
cours of my studies,"--h made a gestur toward hi book and heavili 
laden table,--"of the yezidi of syria evok phantom by mean of 
cut their bodi with knive dure their whirl dances--enorm 
globe of fire which turn into monstrou and terribl forms--and I 
rememb an account somewhere, too, how the emaci form and pallid 
counten of the spectres, that appear to the emperor julian, 
claim to be the true immortals, and told him to renew the sacrific 
of blood 'for the fume of which, sinc the establish of 
christianity, they had been pining'--that these were in realiti the 
phantom evok by the rite of blood." 

both dr. silenc and myself listen in amazement, for thi sudden 
speech wa so unexpected, and betray so much more knowledg than we 
had either of us suspect in the old soldier. 

"then perhap you have read, too," said the doctor, "how the cosmic 
deiti of savag races, element in their nature, have been kept aliv 
through mani age by these blood rites?" 

"no," he answered; "that is new to me." 

"in ani case," dr. silenc added, "I am glad you are not wholli 
unfamiliar with the subject, for you will now bring more sympathy, and 
therefor more help, to our experiment. for, of course, in thi case, we 
onli want the blood to tempt the creatur from it lair and enclos it 
in a form--" 

"I quit understand. and I onli hesit just now," he went on, hi 
word come much more slowly, as though he felt he had alreadi said too 
much, "becaus I wish to be quit sure it wa no mere curiosity, but 
an actual sens of necess that dictat thi horribl experiment." 

"it is your safety, and that of your household, and of your sister, that 
is at stake," repli the doctor. "onc I have _seen_, I hope to 
discov whenc thi element comes, and what it real purpos is." 

colonel wragg signifi hi assent with a bow. 

"and the moon will help us," the other said, "for it will be full in the 
earli hour of the morning, and thi kind of elemental-b is alway 
most activ at the period of full moon. hence, you see, the clue 
furnish by your diary." 

So it wa final settled. colonel wragg would provid the materi 
for the experiment, and we were to meet at midnight. how he would 
contriv at that hour--but that wa hi business. I onli know we both 
realis that he would keep hi word, and whether a pig die at 
midnight, or at noon, wa after all perhap onli a question of the sleep 
and person comfort of the executioner. 

"tonight, then, in the laundry," said dr. silenc finally, to clinch the 
plan; "we three alone--and at midnight, when the household is asleep and 
we shall be free from disturbance." 

He exchang signific glanc with our host, who, at that moment, wa 
call away by the announc that the famili doctor had arrived, and 
wa readi to see him in hi sister' room. 

for the remaind of the afternoon john silenc disappeared. I had my 
suspicion that he made a secret visit to the plantat and also to the 
laundri building; but, in ani case, we saw noth of him, and he kept 
strictli to himself. He wa prepar for the night, I felt sure, but 
the natur of hi prepar I could onli guess. there wa movement in 
hi room, I heard, and an odour like incens hung about the door, and 
know that he regard rite as the vehicl of energies, my guess 
were probabl not far wrong. 

colonel wragge, too, remain absent the greater part of the afternoon, 
and, deepli afflicted, had scarc left hi sister' bedside, but in 
respons to my inquiri when we met for a moment at tea-time, he told me 
that although she had moment of attempt speech, her talk wa quit 
incoher and hysterical, and she wa still quit unabl to explain the 
natur of what she had seen. the doctor, he said, fear she had 
recov the use of her limbs, onli to lose that of her memory, and 
perhap even of her mind. 

"then the recoveri of her legs, I trust, may be permanent, at ani rate," 
I ventured, find it difficult to know what sympathi to offer. and he 
repli with a curiou short laugh, "oh yes; about that there can be no 
doubt whatever." 

and it wa due mere to the chanc of my overhear a fragment of 
conversation--unwillingly, of course--that a littl further light wa 
thrown upon the state in which the old ladi actual lay. for, as I came 
out of my room, it happen that colonel wragg and the doctor were 
go downstair together, and their word float up to my ear befor 
I could make my presenc known by so much as a cough. 

"then you must find a way," the doctor wa say with decision; "for I 
cannot insist too strongli upon that--and at all cost she must be kept 
quiet. these attempt to go out must be prevented--if necessary, by 
force. thi desir to visit some wood or other she keep talk about 
is, of course, hyster in nature. It cannot be permit for a 
moment." 

"it shall not be permitted," I heard the soldier reply, as they reach 
the hall below. 

"it ha impress her mind for some reason--" the doctor went on, by way 
evid of sooth explanation, and then the distanc made it 
imposs for me to hear more. 

At dinner dr. silenc wa still absent, on the public plea of a 
headache, and though food wa sent to hi room, I am inclin to believ 
he did not touch it, but spent the entir time fasting. 

We retir early, desir that the household should do likewise, and I 
must confess that at ten o'clock when I bid my host a temporari 
good-night, and sought my room to make what mental prepar I could, 
I realis in no veri pleasant fashion that it wa a singular and 
formid assignation, thi midnight meet in the laundri building, 
and that there were moment in everi adventur of life when a wise man, 
and one who knew hi own limitations, owe it to hi digniti to withdraw 
discreetly. and, but for the charact of our leader, I probabl should 
have then and there offer the best excus I could think of, and have 
allow myself quietli to fall asleep and wait for an excit stori in 
the morn of what had happened. but with a man like john silence, such 
a laps wa out of the question, and I sat befor my fire count the 
minut and do everyth I could think of to fortifi my resolut 
and fasten my will at the point where I could be reason sure that my 
self-control would hold against all attack of men, devils, or 
elementals. 


iii 

At a quarter befor midnight, clad in a heavi ulster, and with slipper 
feet, I crept cautious from my room and stole down the passag to the 
top of the stairs. outsid the doctor' door I wait a moment to 
listen. all wa still; the hous in utter darkness; no gleam of light 
beneath ani door; only, down the length of the corridor, from the 
direct of the sick-room, came faint sound of laughter and incoher 
talk that were not thing to reassur a mind alreadi half a-tremble, and 
I made hast to reach the hall and let myself out through the front 
door into the night. 

the air wa keen and frosty, perfum with night smells, and exquisit 
fresh; all the million candl of the sky were alight, and a faint 
breez rose and fell with far-away sigh in the top of the pine 
trees. My blood leap for a moment in the spacious of the night, 
for the splendid star brought courage; but the next instant, as I 
turn the corner of the house, move stealthili down the gravel drive, 
my spirit sank again ominously. for, yonder, over the funer plume 
of the twelv acr plantation, I saw the broken, yellow disc of the 
half-moon just rise in the east, stare down like some vast be 
come to watch upon the progress of our doom. seen through the distort 
vapour of the earth' atmosphere, her face look weirdli unfamiliar, 
her usual express of benign vacanc somehow a-twist. I slip 
along by the shadow of the wall, keep my eye upon the ground. 

the laundry-house, as alreadi described, stood detach from the other 
offices, with laurel shrubberi crowd thickli behind it, and the 
kitchen-garden so close on the other side that the strong smell of soil 
and grow thing came across almost heavily. the shadow of the 
haunt plantation, huge lengthen by the rise moon behind them, 
reach to the veri wall and cover the stone tile of the roof with a 
dark pall. So keenli were my sens alert at thi moment that I believ 
I could fill a chapter with the endless small detail of the impress 
I received--shadows, odour, shapes, sounds--in the space of the few 
second I stood and wait befor the close wooden door. 

then I becam awar of some one move toward me through the moonlight, 
and the figur of john silence, without overcoat and bareheaded, came 
quickli and without nois to join me. hi eyes, I saw at once, were 
wonder bright, and so mark wa the shine pallor of hi face 
that I could hardli tell when he pass from the moonlight into the 
shade. 

He pass without a word, beckon me to follow, and then push the 
door open, and went in. 

the chill air of the place met us like that of an underground vault; and 
the brick floor and whitewash walls, streak with damp and smoke, 
threw back the cold in our faces. directli opposit gape the black 
throat of the huge open fireplace, the ash of wood fire still pile 
and scatter about the hearth, and on either side of the project 
chimney-column were the deep recess hold the big twin cauldron for 
boil clothes. upon the lid of these cauldron stood the two littl 
oil lamps, shade red, which gave all the light there was, and 
immedi in front of the fireplac there wa a small circular tabl 
with three chair set about it. overhead, the narrow slit windows, high 
up the walls, point to a dim network of wooden rafter half lost among 
the shadows, and then came the dark vault of the roof. cheerless and 
unalluring, for all the red light, it certainli was, remind me of 
some unus conventicle, bare of pew or pulpit, ugli and severe, and I 
wa forcibl struck by the contrast between the normal use to which the 
place wa ordinarili put, and the strang and mediev purpos which had 
brought us under it roof tonight. 

possibl an involuntari shudder ran over me, for my companion turn 
with a confid look to reassur me, and he wa so complet master of 
himself that I at onc absorb from hi abundance, and felt the chink 
of my fail courag begin to close up. To meet hi eye in the 
presenc of danger wa like find a mental rail that guid and 
support thought along the giddi edg of alarm. 

"I am quit ready," I whispered, turn to listen for approach 
footsteps. 

He nodded, still keep hi eye on mine. our whisper sound hollow 
as they echo overhead among the rafters. 

"i'm glad you are here," he said. "not all would have the courage. keep 
your thought controlled, and imagin the protect shell round 
you--round your inner being." 

"i'm all right," I repeated, curs my chatter teeth. 

He took my hand and shook it, and the contact seem to shake into me 
someth of hi suprem confidence. the eye and hand of a strong man 
can touch the soul. I think he guess my thought, for a pass smile 
flash about the corner of hi mouth. 

"you will feel more comfortable," he said, in a low tone, "when the 
chain is complete. the colonel we can count on, of course. 
remember, though," he ad warningly, "he may perhap becom 
controlled--possessed--when the thing comes, becaus he won't know how 
to resist. and to explain the busi to such a man--!" He shrug 
hi shoulder expressively. "but it will onli be temporary, and I will 
see that no harm come to him." 

He glanc round at the arrang with approval. 

"red light," he said, indic the shade lamps, "ha the lowest rate 
of vibration. materialis are dissip by strong light--won't 
form, or hold together--in rapid vibrations." 

I wa not sure that I approv altogeth of thi dim light, for in 
complet dark there is someth protective--th knowledg that one 
cannot be seen, probably--which a half-light destroys, but I rememb 
the warn to keep my thought steady, and forbor to give them 
expression. 

there wa a step outside, and the figur of colonel wragg stood in the 
doorway. though enter on tiptoe, he made consider nois and 
clatter, for hi free movement were imped by the burden he carried, 
and we saw a larg yellowish bowl held out at arms' length from hi 
body, the mouth cover with a white cloth. hi face, I noted, wa 
rigidli composed. he, too, wa master of himself. and, as I thought of 
thi old soldier move through the long seri of alarms, worn with 
watch and weari with assault, unenlighten yet undismayed, even 
down to the dread shock of hi sister' terror, and still show the 
dog pluck that persist in the face of defeat, I understood what dr. 
silenc meant when he describ him as a man "to be count on." 

I think there wa noth beyond thi rigid of hi stern features, 
and a certain grey of the complexion, to betray the turmoil of the 
emot that were doubtless go on within; and the qualiti of these 
two men, each in hi own way, so key me up that, by the time the door 
wa shut and we had exchang silent greetings, all the latent courag I 
possess wa well to the fore, and I felt as sure of myself as I knew I 
ever could feel. 

colonel wragg set the bowl care in the centr of the table. 

"midnight," he said shortly, glanc at hi watch, and we all three 
move to our chairs. 

there, in the middl of that cold and silent place, we sat, with the 
vile bowl befor us, and a thin, hardli percept steam rise through 
the damp air from the surfac of the white cloth and disappear 
upward the moment it pass beyond the zone of red light and enter 
the deep shadow thrown forward by the project wall of chimney. 

the doctor had indic our respect places, and I found myself 
seat with my back to the door and opposit the black hearth. the 
colonel wa on my left, and dr. silenc on my right, both half face 
me, the latter more in shadow than the former. We thu divid the 
littl tabl into even sections, and sit back in our chair we 
await event in silence. 

for someth like an hour I do not think there wa even the faintest 
sound within those four wall and under the canopi of that vault roof. 
our slipper made no scratch on the gritti floor, and our breath 
wa suppress almost to nothing; even the rustl of our cloth as we 
shift from time to time upon our seat wa inaudible. silenc 
smother us absolutely--th silenc of night, of listening, the silenc 
of a haunt expectancy. the veri gurgl of the lamp wa too soft to 
be heard, and if light itself had sound, I do not think we should have 
notic the silveri tread of the moonlight as it enter the high narrow 
window and threw upon the floor the slender trace of it pallid 
footsteps. 

colonel wragg and the doctor, and myself too for that matter, sat thu 
like figur of stone, without speech and without gesture. My eye 
pass in ceaseless journey from the bowl to their faces, and from 
their face to the bowl. they might have been masks, however, for all 
the sign of life they gave; and the light steam from the horrid 
content beneath the white cloth had long ceas to be visible. 

then presently, as the moon rose higher, the wind rose with it. It 
sighed, like the lightest of pass wings, over the roof; it crept most 
softli round the walls; it made the brick floor like ice beneath our 
feet. with it I saw mental the desol moorland flow like a sea 
about the old house, the treeless expans of lone hills, the nearer 
copses, sombr and mysteri in the night. the plantation, too, in 
particular I saw, and imagin I heard the mourn whisper that 
must now be a-stir among it tree-top as the breez play down 
between the twist stems. In the depth of the room behind us the shaft 
of moonlight met and cross in a grow network. 

It wa after an hour of thi wear and unbroken attention, and I 
should judg about one o'clock in the morning, when the bay of the 
dog in the stableyard first began, and I saw john silenc move suddenli 
in hi chair and sit up in an attitud of attention. everi forc in my 
be instantli leap into the keenest vigilance. colonel wragg move 
too, though slowly, and without rais hi eye from the tabl befor 
him. 

the doctor stretch hi arm out and took the white cloth from the bowl. 

It wa perhap imagin that persuad me the red glare of the lamp 
grew fainter and the air over the tabl befor us thickened. I had been 
expect someth for so long that the movement of my companions, and 
the lift of the cloth, may easili have caus the momentari delus 
that someth hover in the air befor my face, touch the skin of 
my cheek with a silken run. but it wa certainli not a delus that 
the colonel look up at the same moment and glanc over hi shoulder, 
as though hi eye follow the movement of someth to and fro about 
the room, and that he then button hi overcoat more tightli about him 
and hi eye sought my own face first, and then the doctor's. and it wa 
no delus that hi face seem somehow to have turn dark, becom 
spread as it were with a shadowi blackness. I saw hi lip tighten and 
hi express grow hard and stern, and it came to me then with a rush 
that, of course, thi man had told us but a part of the experi he 
had been through in the house, and that there wa much more he had never 
been abl to bring himself to reveal at all. I felt sure of it. the way 
he turn and stare about him betray a familiar with other thing 
than those he had describ to us. It wa not mere a sight of fire he 
look for; it wa a sight of someth alive, intelligent, someth 
abl to evad hi searching; it wa _a person_. It wa the watch for the 
ancient be who sought to obsess him. 

and the way in which dr. silenc answer hi look--though it wa onli 
by a glanc of subtlest sympathy--confirm my impression. 

"we may be readi now," I heard him say in a whisper, and I understood 
that hi word were intend as a steadi warning, and brace myself 
mental to the utmost of my power. 

yet long befor colonel wragg had turn to stare about the room, and 
long befor the doctor had confirm my impress that thing were at 
last begin to stir, I had becom awar in most singular fashion that 
the place held more than our three selves. with the rise of the wind 
thi increas to our number had first taken place. the bay of the 
hound almost seem to have signal it. I cannot say how it may be 
possibl to realis that an empti place ha suddenli become--not empty, 
when the new arriv is noth that appeal to ani one of the senses; 
for thi recognit of an "invisible," as of the chang in the balanc 
of person forc in a human group, is indefin and beyond proof. 
yet it is unmistakable. and I knew perfectli well at what given moment 
the atmospher within these four wall becam charg with the presenc 
of other live be besid ourselves. and, on reflection, I am 
convinc that both my companion knew it too. 

"watch the light," said the doctor under hi breath, and then I knew too 
that it wa no fanci of my own that had turn the air darker, and the 
way he turn to examin the face of our host sent an electr thrill of 
wonder and expect shiver along everi nerv in my body. 

yet it wa no kind of terror that I experienced, but rather a sort of 
mental dizziness, and a sensat as of be suspend in some remot 
and dread altitud where thing might happen, inde were about to 
happen, that had never befor happen within the ken of man. horror may 
have form an ingredient, but it wa not chiefli horror, and in no 
sens ghostli horror. 

uncommon thought kept beat on my brain like tini hammers, soft yet 
persistent, seek admission; their unbidden tide began to wash along 
the far fring of my mind, the current of unwont sensat to rise 
over the remot frontier of my consciousness. I wa awar of thoughts, 
and the fantasi of thoughts, that I never knew befor existed. 
portion of my be stir that had never stir before, and thing 
ancient and inexplic rose to the surfac and beckon me to follow. 
I felt as though I were about to fli off, at some immens tangent, into 
an outer space hitherto unknown even in dreams. and so singular wa the 
result produc upon me that I wa uncommonli glad to anchor my mind, as 
well as my eyes, upon the master person of the doctor at my 
side, for there, I realised, I could draw alway upon the forc of 
saniti and safety. 

with a vigor effort of will I return to the scene befor me, and 
tri to focu my attention, with steadier thoughts, upon the table, and 
upon the silent figur seat round it. and then I saw that certain 
chang had come about in the place where we sat. 

the patch of moonlight on the floor, I noted, had becom curious 
shaded; the face of my companion opposit were not so clearli visibl 
as before; and the forehead and cheek of colonel wragg were glisten 
with perspiration. I realis further, that an extraordinari chang had 
come about in the temperatur of the atmosphere. the increas warmth 
had a pain effect, not alon on colonel wragge, but upon all of us. 
It wa oppress and unnatural. We gasp figur as well as 
actually. 

"you are the first to feel it," said dr. silenc in low tones, look 
across at him. "you are in more intim touch, of course--" 

the colonel wa trembling, and appear to be in consider distress. 
hi knee shook, so that the shuffl of hi slipper feet becam 
audible. He inclin hi head to show that he had heard, but made no 
other reply. I think, even then, he wa sore put to it to keep himself 
in hand. I knew what he wa struggl against. As dr. silenc had 
warn me, he wa about to be obsessed, and wa savagely, though vainly, 
resisting. 

but, meanwhile, a curiou and whirl sens of exhilar began to 
come over me. the increas heat wa delightful, bring a sensat 
of intens activity, of thought pour through the mind at high speed, 
of vivid pictur in the brain, of fierc desir and lightn energi 
aliv in everi part of the body. I wa consciou of no physic 
distress, such as the colonel felt, but onli of a vagu feel that it 
might all grow suddenli too intense--that I might be consumed--that my 
person as well as my body, might becom resolv into the flame of 
pure spirit. I began to live at a speed too intens to last. It wa as 
if a thousand ecstasi besieg me-- 

"steady!" whisper the voic of john silenc in my ear, and I look up 
with a start to see that the colonel had risen from hi chair. the 
doctor rose too. I follow suit, and for the first time saw down into 
the bowl. To my amaz and horror I saw that the content were 
troubled. the blood wa astir with movement. 

the rest of the experi wa wit by us standing. It came, too, 
with a curiou suddenness. there wa no more dreaming, for me at ani 
rate. 

I shall never forget the figur of colonel wragg stand there besid 
me, upright and unshaken, squar plant on hi feet, look about 
him, puzzl beyond belief, yet full of a fight anger. frame by the 
white walls, the red glow of the lamp upon hi stream cheeks, hi 
eye glow against the deathli pallor of hi skin, breath hard and 
make convuls effort of hand and bodi to keep himself under 
control, hi whole be rous to the point of savag fighting, yet 
with noth visibl to get at anywhere--h stood there, immov 
against odds. and the strang contrast of the pale skin and the burn 
face I had never seen before, or wish to see again. 

but what ha left an even sharper impress on my memori wa the 
black that then began crawl over hi face, obliter the 
features, conceal their human outline, and hide him inch by inch 
from view. thi wa my first realis that the process of 
materialis wa at work. hi visag becam shrouded. I move from 
one side to the other to keep him in view, and it wa onli then I 
understood that, properli speaking, the black wa not upon the 
counten of colonel wragge, but that someth had insert itself 
between me and him, thu screen hi face with the effect of a dark 
veil. someth that appar rose through the floor wa pass 
slowli into the air abov the tabl and abov the bowl. the blood in the 
bowl, moreover, wa consider less than before. 

and, with thi chang in the air befor us, there came at the same time 
a further change, I thought, in the face of the soldier. one-half wa 
turn toward the red lamps, while the other caught the pale 
illumin of the moonlight fall aslant from the high windows, so 
that it wa difficult to estim thi chang with accuraci of detail. 
but it seem to me that, while the features--eyes, nose, 
mouth--remain the same, the life inform them had undergon some 
profound transformation. the signatur of a new power had crept into the 
face and left it trace there--an express dark, and in some 
unexplain way, terrible. 

then suddenli he open hi mouth and spoke, and the sound of thi 
chang voice, deep and music though it was, made me cold and set my 
heart beat with uncomfort rapidity. the being, as he had dreaded, 
wa alreadi in control of hi brain, use hi mouth. 

"I see a black like the black of egypt befor my face," said 
the tone of thi unknown voic that seem half hi own and half 
another's. "and out of thi dark they come, they come." 

I gave a dread start. the doctor turn to look at me for an instant, 
and then turn to centr hi attent upon the figur of our host, and 
I understood in some intuit fashion that he wa there to watch over 
the strangest contest man ever saw--to watch over and, if necessary, to 
protect. 

"he is be controlled--possessed," he whisper to me through the 
shadows. hi face wore a wonder expression, half triumph, half 
admiration. 

even as colonel wragg spoke, it seem to me that thi visibl dark 
began to increase, pour up thickli out of the ground by the hearth, 
rise up in sheet and veils, shroud our eye and faces. It stole up 
from below--an aw black that seem to drink in all the 
radiat of light in the building, leav noth but the ghost of a 
radianc in their place. then, out of thi rise sea of shadows, issu 
a pale and spectral light that gradual spread itself about us, and 
from the heart of thi light I saw the shape of fire crowd and gather. 
and these were not human shapes, or the shape of anyth I recognis 
as aliv in the world, but outlin of fire that trace globes, 
triangles, crosses, and the lumin bodi of variou geometr 
figures. they grew bright, faded, and then grew bright again with an 
effect almost of pulsation. they pass swiftli to and fro through the 
air, rise and falling, and particularli in the immedi neighbourhood 
of the colonel, often gather about hi head and shoulders, and even 
appear to settl upon him like giant insect of flame. they were 
accompanied, moreover, by a faint sound of hissing--th same sound we 
had heard that afternoon in the plantation. 

"the fire-element that preced their master," the doctor said in an 
undertone. "be ready." 

and while thi weird display of the shape of fire altern flash 
and faded, and the hiss echo faintli among the dim rafter 
overhead, we heard the aw voic issu at interv from the lip of 
the afflict soldier. It wa a voic of power, splendid in some way I 
cannot describe, and with a certain sens of majesti in it cadences, 
and, as I listen to it with quickli beat heart, I could fanci it 
wa some ancient voic of time itself, echo down immens corridor of 
stone, from the depth of vast temples, from the veri heart of mountain 
tombs. 

"I have seen my divin father, osiris," thunder the great tones. "I 
have scatter the gloom of the night. I have burst through the earth, 
and am one with the starri deities!" 

someth grand came into the soldier' face. He wa stare fixedli 
befor him, as though see nothing. 

"watch," whisper dr. silenc in my ear, and hi whisper seem to come 
from veri far away. 

again the mouth open and the awesom voic issu forth. 

"thoth," it boomed, "ha loosen the bandag of set which fetter my 
mouth. I have taken my place in the great wind of heaven." 

I heard the littl wind of night, with it mourn voic of ages, 
sigh round the wall and over the roof. 

"listen!" came from the doctor at my side, and the thunder of the voic 
continued-- 

"I have hidden myself with you, O ye star that never diminish. I 
rememb my name--in--the--house--of--fire!" 

the voic ceas and the sound die away. someth about the face and 
figur of colonel wragg relaxed, I thought. the terribl look pass 
from hi face. the be that obsess him wa gone. 

"the great ritual," said dr. silenc asid to me, veri low, "the book of 
the dead. now it' leav him. soon the blood will fashion it a body." 

colonel wragge, who had stood absolut motionless all thi time, 
suddenli swayed, so that I thought he wa go to fall,--and, but for 
the quick support of the doctor' arm, he probabl would have fallen, 
for he stagger as in the begin of collapse. 

"I am drunk with the wine of osiris," he cried,--and it wa half with 
hi own voic thi time--"but horus, the etern watcher, is about my 
path--for--safety." the voic dwindl and failed, die away into 
someth almost like a cri of distress. 

"now, watch closely," said dr. silence, speak loud, "for after the 
cri will come the fire!" 

I began to trembl involuntarily; an aw chang had come without 
warn into the air; my leg grew weak as paper beneath my weight and I 
had to support myself by lean on the table. colonel wragge, I saw, 
wa also lean forward with a kind of droop. the shape of fire had 
vanish all, but hi face wa lit by the red lamp and the pale, 
shift moonlight rose behind him like mist. 

We were both gaze at the bowl, now almost empty; the colonel stoop 
so low I fear everi minut he would lose hi balanc and drop into it; 
and the shadow, that had so long been in process of forming, now at 
length began to assum materi outlin in the air befor us. 

then john silenc move forward quickly. He took hi place between us 
and the shadow. erect, formidable, absolut master of the situation, I 
saw him stand there, hi face calm and almost smiling, and fire in hi 
eyes. hi protect influenc wa astound and incalculable. even the 
abhorr dread I felt at the sight of the creatur grow into life 
and substanc befor us, lessen in some way so that I wa abl to keep 
my eye fix on the air abov the bowl without too vivid a terror. 

but as it took shape, rise out of noth as it were, and grow 
momentarili more defin in outline, a period of utter and wonder 
silenc settl down upon the build and all it contained. A hush of 
ages, like the sudden centr of peac at the heart of the travel 
cyclone, descend through the night, and out of thi hush, as out of 
the eman of the steam blood, issu the form of the ancient 
be who had first sent the element of fire upon it mission. It grew 
and darken and solidifi befor our eyes. It rose from just beyond 
the tabl so that the lower portion remain invisible, but I saw the 
outlin limn itself upon the air, as though slowli reveal by the 
rise of a curtain. It appar had not then quit concentr to 
the normal proportions, but wa spread out on all side into space, 
huge, though rapidli condensing, for I saw the coloss shoulders, the 
neck, the lower portion of the dark jaws, the terribl mouth, and then 
the teeth and lips--and, as the veil seem to lift further upon the 
tremend face--i saw the nose and cheek bones. In anoth moment I 
should have look straight into the eyes-- 

but what dr. silenc did at that moment wa so unexpected, and took me 
so by surprise, that I have never yet properli understood it nature, 
and he ha never yet seen fit to explain in detail to me. He utter 
some sound that had a note of command in it--and, in so doing, step 
forward and interven between me and the face. the figure, just near 
completeness, he therefor hid from my sight--and I have alway thought 
purpos hid from my sight. 

"the fire!" he cri out. "the fire! beware!" 

there wa a sudden roar as of flame from the veri mouth of the pit, and 
for the space of a singl second all grew light as day. A blind flash 
pass across my face, and there wa heat for an instant that seem to 
shrivel skin, and flesh, and bone. then came steps, and I heard colonel 
wragg utter a great cry, wilder than ani human cri I have ever known. 
the heat suck all the breath out of my lung with a rush, and the 
blaze of light, as it vanished, swept my vision with it into envelop 
darkness. 

when I recov the use of my sens a few moment later I saw that 
colonel wragg with a face of death, it white strang stained, 
had move closer to me. dr. silenc stood besid him, an express of 
triumph and success in hi eyes. the next minut the soldier tri to 
clutch me with hi hand. then he reeled, staggered, and, unabl to save 
himself, fell with a great crash upon the brick floor. 

after the sheet of flame, a wind rage round the build as though it 
would lift the roof off, but then pass as suddenli as it came. and in 
the intens calm that follow I saw that the form had vanished, and the 
doctor wa stoop over colonel wragg upon the floor, tri to lift 
him to a sit position. 

"light," he said quietly, "more light. take the shade off." 

colonel wragg sat up and the glare of the unshad lamp fell upon hi 
face. It wa grey and drawn, still run heat, and there wa a look in 
the eye and about the corner of the mouth that seem in thi short 
space of time to have ad year to it age. At the same time, the 
express of effort and anxieti had left it. It show relief. 

"gone!" he said, look up at the doctor in a daze fashion, and 
struggl to hi feet. "thank god! it' gone at last." He stare round 
the laundri as though to find out where he was. "did it control me--tak 
possess of me? did I talk nonsense?" he ask bluntly. "after the 
heat came, I rememb nothing--" 

"you'll feel yourself again in a few minutes," the doctor said. To my 
infinit horror I saw that he wa surreptiti wipe sundri dark 
stain from the face. "our experi ha been a success and--" 

He gave me a swift glanc to hide the bowl, stand between me and our 
host while I hurriedli stuf it down under the lid of the nearest 
cauldron. 

"--and none of us the wors for it," he finished. 

"and fires?" he asked, still dazed, "there'l be no more fires?" 

"it is dissipated--partly, at ani rate," repli dr. silenc cautiously. 

"and the man behind the gun," he went on, onli half realis what he 
wa saying, I think; "have you discov _that?_" 

"A form materialised," said the doctor briefly. "I know for certain now 
what the direct intellig wa behind it all." 

colonel wragg pull himself togeth and got upon hi feet. the word 
convey no clear mean to him yet. but hi memori wa return 
gradually, and he wa tri to piec togeth the fragment into a 
connect whole. He shiver a little, for the place had grown suddenli 
chilly. the air wa empti again, lifeless. 

"you feel all right again now," dr. silenc said, in the tone of a man 
state a fact rather than ask a question. 

"thank to you--both, yes." He drew a deep breath, and mop hi face, 
and even attempt a smile. He made me think of a man come from the 
battlefield with the stain of fight still upon him, but scorn of 
hi wounds. then he turn grave toward the doctor with a question 
in hi eyes. memori had return and he wa himself again. 

"precis what I expected," the doctor said calmly; "a fire-element 
sent upon it mission in the day of thebes, centuri befor christ, 
and tonight, for the first time all these thousand of years, releas 
from the spell that origin bound it." 

We stare at him in amazement, colonel wragg open hi lip for word 
that refus to shape themselves. 

"and, if we dig," he continu significantly, point to the floor 
where the black had pour up, "we shall find some underground 
connection--a tunnel most likely--lead to the twelv acr wood. It 
wa made by--your predecessor." 

"A tunnel made by my brother!" gasp the soldier. "then my sister 
should know--sh live here with him--" He stop suddenly. 

john silenc inclin hi head slowly. "I think so," he said quietly. 
"your brother, no doubt, wa as much torment as you have been," he 
continu after a paus in which colonel wragg seem deepli 
preoccupi with hi thoughts, "and tri to find peac by buri it in 
the wood, and surround the wood then, like a larg magic circle, with 
the enchant of the old formulae. So the star the man saw 
blazing--" 

"but buri what?" ask the soldier faintly, step backward 
toward the support of the wall. 

dr. silenc regard us both intent for a moment befor he replied. I 
think he weigh in hi mind whether to tell us now, or when the 
investig wa absolut complete. 

"the mummy," he said softly, after a moment; "the mummi that your 
brother took from it rest place of centuries, and brought 
home--here." 

colonel wragg drop down upon the nearest chair, hang breathlessli 
on everi word. He wa far too amaz for speech. 

"the mummi of some import person--a priest most likely--protect 
from disturb and desecr by the ceremoni magic of the time. 
for they understood how to attach to the mummy, to lock up with it in 
the tomb, an element forc that would direct itself even after age 
upon ani one who dare to molest it. In thi case it wa an element of 
fire." 

dr. silenc cross the floor and turn out the lamp one by one. He 
had noth more to say for the moment. follow hi example, I fold 
the tabl togeth and took up the chairs, and our host, still daze and 
silent, mechan obey him and move to the door. 

We remov all trace of the experiment, take the empti bowl back to 
the hous conceal beneath an ulster. 

the air wa cool and fragrant as we walk to the house, the star 
begin to fade overhead and a fresh wind of earli morn blow up 
out of the east where the sky wa alreadi hint of the come day. It 
wa after five o'clock. 

stealthili we enter the front hall and lock the door, and as we went 
on tipto upstair to our rooms, the colonel, peer at us over hi 
candl as he nod good-night, whisper that if we were readi the 
dig should be begun that veri day. 

then I saw him steal along to hi sister' room and disappear. 


IV 

but not even the mysteri refer to the mummy, or the prospect of 
a revel by digging, were abl to hinder the reaction that follow 
the intens excit of the past twelv hours, and I slept the sleep 
of the dead, dreamless and undisturbed. A touch on the shoulder woke me, 
and I saw dr. silenc stand besid the bed, dress to go out. 

"come," he said, "it' tea-time. you'v slept the best part of a dozen 
hours." 

I sprang up and made a hurri toilet, while my companion sat and 
talked. He look fresh and rested, and hi manner wa even quieter than 
usual. 

"colonel wragg ha provid spade and pickaxes. we'r go out to 
unearth thi mummi at once," he said; "and there' no reason we should 
not get away by the morn train." 

"i'm readi to go tonight, if you are," I said honestly. 

but dr. silenc shook hi head. 

"I must see thi through to the end," he said gravely, and in a tone 
that made me think he still anticip seriou things, perhaps. He went 
on talk while I dressed. 

"thi case is realli typic of all stori of mummy-haunting, and none 
of them are case to trifl with," he explained, "for the mummi of 
import people--kings, priests, magicians--wer laid away with 
profoundli signific ceremonial, and were veri effect protected, 
as you have seen, against desecration, and especi against 
destruction. 

"the gener belief," he went on, anticip my questions, "held, of 
course, that the perpetu of the mummi guarante that of it ka,--th 
owner' spirit,--but it is not improb that the magic embalm 
wa also use to retard reincarnation, the preserv of the bodi 
prevent the return of the spirit to the toil and disciplin of 
earth-life; and, in ani case, they knew how to attach power 
guardian-forc to keep off trespassers. and ani one who dare to remov 
the mummy, or especi to unwind it--well," he added, with meaning, 
"you have seen--and you will see." 

I caught hi face in the mirror while I struggl with my collar. It wa 
deepli serious. there could be no question that he spoke of what he 
believ and knew. 

"the traveller-broth who brought it here must have been haunt too," 
he continued, "for he tri to banish it by burial in the wood, make a 
magic circl to enclos it. someth of genuin ceremoni he must have 
known, for the star the man saw were of cours the remain of the still 
flame pentagram he trace at interv in the circle. onli he did not 
know enough, or possibl wa ignor that the mummy' guardian wa a 
fire-force. fire cannot be enclos by fire, though, as you saw, it can 
be releas by it." 

"then that aw figur in the laundry?" I asked, thrill to find him 
so communicative. 

"undoubtedli the actual Ka of the mummi oper alway behind it 
agent, the elemental, and most like thousand of year old." 

"and miss wragge--?" I ventur onc more. 

"ah, miss wragge," he repeat with increas gravity, "miss wragge--" 

A knock at the door brought a servant with word that tea wa ready, and 
the colonel had sent to ask if we were come down. the thread wa 
broken. dr. silenc move to the door and sign to me to follow. but 
hi manner told me that in ani case no real answer would have been 
forthcom to my question. 

"and the place to dig in," I asked, unabl to restrain my curiosity, 
"will you find it by some process of divin or--?" 

He paus at the door and look back at me, and with that he left me to 
finish my dressing. 

It wa grow dark when the three of us silent made our way to the 
twelv acr plantation; the sky wa overcast, and a black wind came out 
of the east. gloom hung about the old hous and the air seem full of 
sighings. We found the tool readi laid at the edg of the wood, and 
each shoulder hi piece, we follow our leader at onc in among the 
trees. He went straight forward for some twenti yard and then stopped. 
At hi feet lay the blacken circl of one of the burn places. It wa 
just discern against the surround white grass. 

"there are three of these," he said, "and they all lie in a line with 
one another. ani one of them will tap the tunnel that connect the 
laundry--th former museum--with the chamber where the mummi now lie 
buried." 

He at onc clear away the burnt grass and began to dig; we all began 
to dig. while I use the pick, the other shovel vigorously. No one 
spoke. colonel wragg work the hardest of the three. the soil wa 
light and sandy, and there were onli a few snake-lik root and 
occasion loos stone to delay us. the pick made short work of these. 
and meanwhil the dark settl about us and the bite wind swept 
roar through the tree overhead. 

then, quit suddenly, without a cry, colonel wragg disappear up to 
hi neck. 

"the tunnel!" cri the doctor, help to drag him out, red, 
breathless, and cover with sand and perspiration. "now, let me lead 
the way." and he slip down nimbl into the hole, so that a moment 
later we heard hi voice, muffl by sand and distance, rise up to us. 

"hubbard, you come next, and then colonel wragge--if he wishes," we 
heard. 

"i'll follow you, of course," he said, look at me as I scrambl in. 

the hole wa bigger now, and I got down on all-four in a channel not 
much bigger than a larg sewer-pip and found myself in total darkness. 
A minut later a heavi thud, follow by a cataract of loos sand, 
announc the arriv of the colonel. 

"catch hold of my heel," call dr. silence, "and colonel wragg can 
take yours." 

In thi slow, labori fashion we worm our way along a tunnel that 
had been roughli dug out of the shift sand, and wa shore up 
clumsili by mean of wooden pillar and posts. ani moment, it seem to 
me, we might be buri alive. We could not see an inch befor our eyes, 
but had to grope our way feel the pillar and the walls. It wa 
difficult to breathe, and the colonel behind me made but slow progress, 
for the cramp posit of our bodi wa veri severe. 

We had travel in thi way for ten minutes, and gone perhap as much 
as ten yards, when I lost my grasp of the doctor' heel. 

"ah!" I heard hi voice, sound abov me somewhere. He wa stand up 
in a clear space, and the next moment I wa stand besid him. colonel 
wragg came heavili after, and he too rose up and stood. then dr. 
silenc produc hi candl and we heard prepar for strike 
matches. 

yet even befor there wa light, an indefin sensat of awe came 
over us all. In thi hole in the sand, some three feet under ground, we 
stood side by side, cramp and huddled, struck suddenli with an over 
whelm apprehens of someth ancient, someth formidable, 
someth incalcul wonderful, that touch in each one of us a sens 
of the sublim and the terribl even befor we could see an inch befor 
our faces. I know not how to express in languag thi singular emot 
that caught us here in utter darkness, touch no sens directly, it 
seemed, yet with the recognit that befor us in the black of thi 
underground night there lay someth that wa mighti with the 
mighti of long past ages. 

I felt colonel wragg press in close to my side, and I understood the 
pressur and welcom it. No human touch, to me at least, ha ever been 
more eloquent. 

then the match flared, a thousand shadow fled on black wings, and I saw 
john silenc fumbl with the candle, hi face lit up grotesqu by 
the flicker light below it. 

I had dread thi light, yet when it came there wa appar noth 
to explain the profound sensat of dread that preced it. We stood 
in a small vault chamber in the sand, the side and roof shore with 
bar of wood, and the ground laid roughli with what seem to be tiles. 
It wa six feet high, so that we could all stand comfortably, and may 
have been ten feet long by eight feet wide. upon the wooden pillar at 
the side I saw that egyptian hieroglyph had been rude trace by 
burning. 

dr. silenc lit three candl and hand one to each of us. He place a 
fourth in the sand against the wall on hi right, and anoth to mark 
the entranc to the tunnel. We stood and stare about us, instinct 
hold our breath. 

"empty, by god!" exclaim colonel wragge. hi voic trembl with 
excitement. and then, as hi eye rest on the ground, he added, "and 
footsteps--look--footstep in the sand!" 

dr. silenc said nothing. He stoop down and began to make a search of 
the chamber, and as he moved, my eye follow hi crouch figur and 
note the queer distort shadow that pour over the wall and ceil 
after him. here and there thin trickl of loos sand ran fizz down 
the sides. the atmosphere, heavili charg with faint yet pungent 
odours, lay utterli still, and the flame of the candl might have been 
paint on the air for all the movement they betrayed. 

and, as I watched, it wa almost necessari to persuad myself forcibl 
that I wa onli stand upright with difficulti in thi littl 
sand-hol of a modern garden in the south of england, for it seem to 
me that I stood, as in vision, at the entranc of some vast rock-hewn 
templ far, far down the river of time. the illus wa powerful, and 
persisted. granit columns, that rose to heaven, pile themselv about 
me, majest uprearing, and a roof like the sky itself spread abov 
a line of coloss figur that move in shadowi process along 
endless and stupend aisles. thi huge and splendid fantasy, born I 
knew not whence, possess me so vividli that I wa actual oblig to 
concentr my attent upon the small stoop figur of the doctor, 
as he grope about the walls, in order to keep the eye of imagin on 
the scene befor me. 

but the limit space render a long search out of the question, and 
hi footsteps, instead of shuffl through loos sand, present struck 
someth of a differ qualiti that gave forth a hollow and resound 
echo. He stoop to examin more closely. 

He wa stand exactli in the centr of the littl chamber when thi 
happened, and he at onc began scrape away the sand with hi feet. In 
less than a minut a smooth surfac becam visible--th surfac of a 
wooden covering. the next thing I saw wa that he had rais it and wa 
peer down into a space below. instantly, a strong odour of nitr and 
bitumen, mingl with the strang perfum of unknown and powder 
aromatics, rose up from the uncov space and fill the vault, 
sting the throat and make the eye water and smart. 

"the mummy!" whisper dr. silence, look up into our face over hi 
candle; and as he said the word I felt the soldier lurch against me, and 
heard hi breath in my veri ear. 

"the mummy!" he repeat under hi breath, as we press forward to 
look. 

It is difficult to say exactli whi the sight should have stir in me 
so prodigi an emot of wonder and veneration, for I have had not a 
littl to do with mummies, have unwound score of them, and even 
experi magic with not a few. but there wa someth in the 
sight of that grey and silent figure, lie in it modern box of lead 
and wood at the bottom of thi sandi grave, swath in the bandag of 
centuri and wrap in the perfum linen that the priest of egypt 
had pray over with their mighti enchant thousand of year 
before--someth in the sight of it lie there and breath it own 
spice-laden atmospher even in the dark of it exil in thi remot 
land, someth that pierc to the veri core of my be and touch 
that root of awe which slumber in everi man near the birth of tear and 
the passion of true worship. 

I rememb turn quickli from the colonel, lest he should see my 
emotion, yet fail to understand it cause, turn and clutch john silenc 
by the arm, and then fall trembl to see that he, too, had lower hi 
head and wa hide hi face in hi hands. 

A kind of whirl storm came over me, rise out of I know not what 
utter deep of memory, and in a white of vision I heard the magic 
old chaunt from the book of the dead, and saw the god pass by in 
dim procession, the mighty, immemori be who were yet themselv 
onli the personifi attribut of the true gods, the god with the eye 
of fire, the god with the face of smoke. I saw again anubis, the 
dog-fac deity, and the children of horus, etern watcher of the ages, 
as they swath osiris, the first mummi of the world, in the scent and 
mystic bands, and I tast again someth of the ecstasi of the 
justifi soul as it embark in the golden boat of ra, and journey 
onward to rest in the field of the blessed. 

and then, as dr. silence, with infinit reverence, stoop and touch 
the still face, so dread stare with it paint eyes, there rose 
again to our nostril wave upon wave of thi perfum of thousand of 
years, and time fled backward like a thing of naught, show me in 
haunt panorama the most wonder dream of the whole world. 

A gentl hiss becam audibl in the air, and the doctor move quickli 
backwards. It came close to our face and then seem to play about the 
wall and ceiling. 

"the last of the fire--stil wait for it full accomplishment," he 
muttered; but I heard both word and hiss as thing far away, for I 
wa still busi with the journey of the soul through the seven hall of 
death, listen for echo of the grandest ritual ever known to men. 

the earthen plate cover with hieroglyph still lay besid the 
mummy, and round it, care arrang at the point of the compass, 
stood the four jar with the head of the hawk, the jackal, the 
cynocephalus, and man, the jar in which were place the hair, the nail 
parings, the heart, and other special portion of the body. even the 
amulets, the mirror, the blue clay statu of the ka, and the lamp with 
seven wick were there. onli the sacr scarabaeu wa missing. 

"not onli ha it been torn from it ancient resting-place," I heard dr. 
silenc say in a solemn voic as he look at colonel wragg with 
fix gaze, "but it ha been partial unwound,"--h point to the 
wrap of the breast,--"and--th scarabaeu ha been remov from the 
throat." 

the hissing, that wa like the hiss of an invis flame, had 
ceased; onli from time to time we heard it as though it pass backward 
and forward in the tunnel; and we stood look into each other' face 
without speaking. 

present colonel wragg made a great effort and brace himself. I heard 
the sound catch in hi throat befor the word actual becam audible. 

"mi sister," he said, veri low. and then there follow a long pause, 
broken at length by john silence. 

"it must be replaced," he said significantly. 

"I knew nothing," the soldier said, forc himself to speak the word 
he hate saying. "absolut nothing." 

"it must be returned," repeat the other, "if it is not now too late. 
for I fear--i fear--" 

colonel wragg made a movement of assent with hi head. 

"it shall be," he said. 

the place wa still as the grave. 

I do not know what it wa then that made us all three turn round with so 
sudden a start, for there wa no sound audibl to my ears, at least. 

the doctor wa on the point of replac the lid over the mummy, when he 
straighten up as if he had been shot. 

"there' someth coming," said colonel wragg under hi breath, and 
the doctor' eyes, peer down the small open of the tunnel, show 
me the true direction. 

A distant shuffl nois becam distinctli audibl come from a point 
about half-way down the tunnel we had so labori penetrated. 

"it' the sand fall in," I said, though I knew it wa foolish. 

"no," said the colonel calmly, in a voic that seem to have the ring 
of iron, "i'v heard it for some time past. It is someth alive--and 
it is come nearer." 

He stare about him with a look of resolut that made hi face almost 
noble. the horror in hi heart wa overmastering, yet he stood there 
prepar for anyth that might come. 

"there' no other way out," john silenc said. 

He lean the lid against the sand, and waited. I knew by the masklik 
express of hi face, the pallor, and the steadi of the eyes, that 
he anticip someth that might be veri terrible--appalling. 

the colonel and myself stood on either side of the opening. I still held 
my candl and wa asham of the way it shook, drip the greas all 
over me; but the soldier had set hi into the sand just behind hi feet. 

thought of be buri alive, of be smother like rat in a trap, 
of be caught and done to death by some invis and merciless forc 
we could not grappl with, rush into my mind. then I thought of 
fire--of suffocation--of be roast alive. the perspir began to 
pour from my face. 

"steady!" came the voic of dr. silenc to me through the vault. 

for five minutes, that seem fifty, we stood waiting, look from 
each other' face to the mummy, and from the mummi to the hole, and all 
the time the shuffl sound, soft and stealthy, came gradual nearer. 
the tension, for me at least, wa veri near the break point when at 
last the caus of the disturb reach the edge. It wa hidden for a 
moment just behind the broken rim of soil. A jet of sand, shaken by the 
close vibration, trickl down on to the ground; I have never in my life 
seen anyth fall with such labori leisure. the next second, 
utter a cri of curiou quality, it came into view. 

and it wa far more distressingli horribl than anyth I had 
anticipated. 

for the sight of some egyptian monster, some god of the tombs, or even 
of some demon of fire, I think I wa alreadi half prepared; but when, 
instead, I saw the white visag of miss wragg frame in that round 
open of sand, follow by her bodi crawl on all fours, her eye 
bulg and reflect the yellow glare of the candles, my first 
instinct wa to turn and run like a frantic anim seek a way of 
escape. 

but dr. silence, who seem no whit surprised, caught my arm and 
steadi me, and we both saw the colonel then drop upon hi knee and 
come thu to a level with hi sister. for more than a whole minute, as 
though struck in stone, the two face gaze silent at each other: 
hers, for all the dread emot in it, more like a gargoyl than 
anyth human; and his, white and blank with an express that wa 
beyond either astonish or alarm. she look up; he look down. It 
wa a pictur in a nightmare, and the candle, stuck in the sand close to 
the hole, threw upon it the glare of impromptu footlights. 

then john silenc move forward and spoke in a voic that wa veri low, 
yet perfectli calm and natural. 

"I am glad you have come," he said. "you are the one person whose 
presenc at thi moment is most required. and I hope that you may yet be 
in time to appeas the anger of the fire, and to bring peac again to 
your household, and," he ad lower still so that no one heard it but 
myself, "_safeti to yourself_." 

and while her brother stumbl backwards, crush a candl into the 
sand in hi awkwardness, the old ladi crawl farther into the vault 
chamber and slowli rose upon her feet. 

At the sight of the wrap figur of the mummi I wa fulli prepar to 
see her scream and faint, but on the contrary, to my complet amazement, 
she mere bow her head and drop quietli upon her knees. then, 
after a paus of more than a minute, she rais her eye to the roof and 
her lip began to mutter as in prayer. her right hand, meanwhile, which 
had been fumbl for some time at her throat suddenli came away, and 
befor the gaze of all of us she held it out, palm upwards, over the 
grey and ancient figur outstretch below. and in it we beheld 
glisten the green jasper of the stolen scarabaeus. 

her brother, lean heavili against the wall behind, utter a sound 
that wa half cry, half exclamation, but john silence, stand directli 
in front of her, mere fix hi eye on her and point downward to 
the stare face below. 

"replac it," he said sternly, "where it belongs." 

miss wragg wa kneel at the feet of the mummi when thi happened. We 
three men all had our eye rivet on what followed. onli the reader who 
by some remot chanc may have wit a line of mummies, freshli laid 
from their tomb upon the sand, slowli stir and bend as the heat of the 
egyptian sun warm their ancient bodi into the semblanc of life, can 
form ani concept of the ultim horror we experienc when the 
silent figur befor us move in it grave of lead and sand. slowly, 
befor our eyes, it writhed, and, with a faint rustl of the 
immemori cerements, rose up, and, through sightless and bandag eyes, 
stare across the yellow candlelight at the woman who had violat it. 

I tri to move--h brother tri to move--but the sand seem to hold 
our feet. I tri to cry--her brother tri to cry--but the sand seem 
to fill our lung and throat. We could onli stare--and, even so, the 
sand seem to rise like a desert storm and cloud our vision ... 

and when I manag at length to open my eye again, the mummi wa lie 
onc more upon it back, motionless, the shrunken and paint face 
upturn toward the ceiling, and the old ladi had tumbl forward and 
wa lie in the semblanc of death with her head and arm upon it 
crumbl body. 

but upon the wrap of the throat I saw the green jasper of the 
sacr scarabaeu shine again like a live eye. 

colonel wragg and the doctor recov themselv long befor I did, 
and I found myself help them clumsili and unintellig to rais 
the frail bodi of the old lady, while john silenc care replac 
the cover over the grave and scrape back the sand with hi foot, 
while he issu brief directions. 

I heard hi voic as in a dream; but the journey back along that cramp 
tunnel, weight by a dead woman, blind with sand, suffoc with 
heat, wa in no sens a dream. It took us the best part of half an hour 
to reach the open air. and, even then, we had to wait a consider 
time for the appear of dr. silence. We carri her undiscov into 
the hous and up to her own room. 

"the mummi will caus no further disturbance," I heard dr. silenc say 
to our host later that even as we prepar to drive for the night 
train, "provid always," he ad significantly, "that you, and yours, 
caus it no disturbance." 

It wa in a dream, too, that we left. 

"you did not see her face, I know," he said to me as we wrap our rug 
about us in the empti compartment. and when I shook my head, quit 
unabl to explain the instinct that had come to me not to look, he 
turn toward me, hi face pale, and genuin sad. 

"scorch and blasted," he whispered.
