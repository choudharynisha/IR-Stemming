the cask of amontillado 


by 

edgar allan poe 


prefac 
the thousand injuri of fortunato I had born as I best could, but 
when he ventur upon insult, I vow revenge. you, who so well know 
the natur of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utter 
to a threat. _at length_ I would be avenged; thi wa a point definit 
settled--but the veri definit with which it wa resolved, 
preclud the idea of risk. I must not onli punish, but punish with 
impunity. A wrong is unredress when retribut overtak it 
redresser. It is equal unredress when the aveng fail to make 
himself felt as such to him who ha done the wrong. 

It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given 
fortunato caus to doubt my good will. I continued, as wa my wont, to 
smile in hi face, and he did not perceiv that my smile _now_ wa at 
the thought of hi immolation. 

He had a weak point--thi fortunato--although in other regard he wa a 
man to be respect and even feared. He pride himself on hi 
connoisseurship in wine. few italian have the true virtuoso spirit. 
for the most part their enthusiasm is adopt to suit the time and 
opportunity--to practis impostur upon the british and austrian 
_millionaires_. In paint and gemmary, fortunato, like hi countrymen, 
wa a quack--but in the matter of old wine he wa sincere. In thi 
respect I did not differ from him materially: I wa skill in the 
italian vintag myself, and bought larg whenev I could. 

It wa about dusk, one even dure the suprem mad of the 
carniv season, that I encount my friend. He accost me with 
excess warmth, for he had been drink much. the man wore motley. 
He had on a tight-fit parti-strip dress, and hi head wa 
surmount by the conic cap and bells. I wa so pleas to see him, 
that I thought I should never have done wring hi hand. 

I said to him--"mi dear fortunato, you are luckili met. how remark 
well you are look to-day! but I have receiv a pipe of what pass 
for amontillado, and I have my doubts." 

"how?" said he. "amontillado? A pipe? impossible! and in the middl 
of the carnival!" 

"I have my doubts," I replied; "and I wa silli enough to pay the full 
amontillado price without consult you in the matter. you were not to 
be found, and I wa fear of lose a bargain." 

"amontillado!" 

"I have my doubts." 

"amontillado!" 

"and I must satisfi them." 

"amontillado!" 

"a you are engaged, I am on my way to luchesi. If ani one ha a 
critic turn, it is he. He will tell me--" 

"luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry." 

"and yet some fool will have it that hi tast is a match for your 
own." 

"come, let us go." 

"whither?" 

"to your vaults." 

"mi friend, no; I will not impos upon your good nature. I perceiv 
you have an engagement. luchesi--" 

"I have no engagement;--come." 

"mi friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the sever cold with 
which I perceiv you are afflicted. the vault are insuffer damp. 
they are encrust with nitre." 

"let us go, nevertheless. the cold is mere nothing. amontillado! 
you have been impos upon. and as for luchesi, he cannot distinguish 
sherri from amontillado." 

thu speaking, fortunato possess himself of my arm. put on a mask 
of black silk, and draw a _roquelaire_ close about my person, I 
suffer him to hurri me to my palazzo. 

there were no attend at home; they had abscond to make merri in 
honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the 
morning, and had given them explicit order not to stir from the house. 
these order were sufficient, I well knew, to insur their immedi 
disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back wa turned. 

I took from their sconc two flambeaux, and give one to fortunato, 
bow him through sever suit of room to the archway that led into 
the vaults. I pass down a long and wind staircase, request him 
to be cautiou as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the 
descent, and stood togeth on the damp ground of the catacomb of the 
montresors. 

the gait of my friend wa unsteady, and the bell upon hi cap jingl 
as he strode. 

"the pipe," said he. 

"it is farther on," said I; "but observ the white web-work which 
gleam from these cavern walls." 

He turn toward me, and look into my eye with two filmi orb that 
distil the rheum of intoxication. 

"nitre?" he asked, at length. 

"nitre," I replied. "how long have you had that cough?" 

"ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! 
ugh! ugh!" 

My poor friend found it imposs to repli for mani minutes. 

"it is nothing," he said, at last. 

"come," I said, with decision, "we will go back; your health is 
precious. you are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as 
onc I was. you are a man to be missed. for me it is no matter. We 
will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. besides, 
there is luchesi--" 

"enough," he said; "the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. 
I shall not die of a cough." 

"true--true," I replied; "and, indeed, I had no intent of alarm 
you unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of 
thi medoc will defend us from the damps." 

here I knock off the neck of a bottl which I drew from a long row of 
it fellow that lay upon the mould. 

"drink," I said, present him the wine. 

He rais it to hi lip with a leer. He paus and nod to me 
familiarly, while hi bell jingled. 

"I drink," he said, "to the buri that repos around us." 

"and I to your long life." 

He again took my arm, and we proceeded. 

"these vaults," he said, "are extensive." 

"the montresors," I replied, "were a great and numer family." 

"I forget your arms." 

"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crush a serpent 
rampant whose fang are imbed in the heel." 

"and the motto?" 

"_nemo me impun lacessit_." 

"good!" he said. 

the wine sparkl in hi eye and the bell jingled. My own fanci grew 
warm with the medoc. We had pass through wall of pile bones, with 
cask and puncheon intermingling, into the inmost recess of 
catacombs. I paus again, and thi time I made bold to seiz 
fortunato by an arm abov the elbow. 

"the nitre!" I said; "see, it increases. It hang like moss upon the 
vaults. We are below the river' bed. the drop of moistur trickl 
among the bones. come, we will go back ere it is too late. your 
cough--" 

"it is nothing," he said; "let us go on. but first, anoth draught of 
the medoc." 

I broke and reach him a flagon of De grave. He empti it at a 
breath. hi eye flash with a fierc light. He laugh and threw 
the bottl upward with a gesticul I did not understand. 

I look at him in surprise. He repeat the movement--a grotesqu one. 

"you do not comprehend?" he said. 

"not i," I replied. 

"then you are not of the brotherhood." 

"how?" 

"you are not of the masons." 

"yes, yes," I said; "yes, yes." 

"you? impossible! A mason?" 

"A mason," I replied. 

"A sign," he said, "a sign." 

"it is this," I answered, produc a trowel from beneath the fold of 
my _roquelaire_. 

"you jest," he exclaimed, recoil a few paces. "but let us proceed 
to the amontillado." 

"be it so," I said, replac the tool beneath the cloak and again 
offer him my arm. He lean upon it heavily. We continu our 
rout in search of the amontillado. We pass through a rang of low 
arches, descended, pass on, and descend again, arriv at a deep 
crypt, in which the foul of the air caus our flambeaux rather to 
glow than flame. 

At the most remot end of the crypt there appear anoth less 
spacious. it wall had been line with human remains, pile to the 
vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacomb of paris. three 
side of thi interior crypt were still ornament in thi manner. 
from the fourth side the bone had been thrown down, and lay 
promiscu upon the earth, form at one point a mound of some 
size. within the wall thu expos by the displac of the bones, we 
perceiv a still interior recess, in depth about four feet in width 
three, in height six or seven. It seem to have been construct for 
no especi use within itself, but form mere the interv between 
two of the coloss support of the roof of the catacombs, and wa 
back by one of their circumscrib wall of solid granite. 

It wa in vain that fortunato, uplift hi dull torch, endeavour to 
pri into the depth of the recess. it termin the feebl light did 
not enabl us to see. 

"proceed," I said; "herein is the amontillado. As for luchesi--" 

"he is an ignoramus," interrupt my friend, as he step unsteadili 
forward, while I follow immedi at hi heels. In an instant he 
had reach the extrem of the niche, and find hi progress 
arrest by the rock, stood stupidli bewildered. A moment more and I 
had fetter him to the granite. In it surfac were two iron staples, 
distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. from one of 
these depend a short chain, from the other a padlock. throw the 
link about hi waist, it wa but the work of a few second to secur 
it. He wa too much astound to resist. withdraw the key I 
step back from the recess. 

"pass your hand," I said, "over the wall; you cannot help feel the 
nitre. indeed, it is _very_ damp. onc more let me _implore_ you to 
return. no? then I must posit leav you. but I must first 
render you all the littl attent in my power." 

"the amontillado!" ejacul my friend, not yet recov from hi 
astonishment. 

"true," I replied; "the amontillado." 

As I said these word I busi myself among the pile of bone of which 
I have befor spoken. throw them aside, I soon uncov a quantiti 
of build stone and mortar. with these materi and with the aid of 
my trowel, I began vigor to wall up the entranc of the niche. 

I had scarc laid the first tier of the masonri when I discov 
that the intox of fortunato had in a great measur worn off. the 
earliest indic I had of thi wa a low moan cri from the depth 
of the recess. It wa _not_ the cri of a drunken man. there wa then a 
long and obstin silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and 
the fourth; and then I heard the furiou vibrat of the chain. the 
nois last for sever minutes, dure which, that I might hearken to 
it with the more satisfaction, I ceas my labour and sat down upon 
the bones. when at last the clank subsided, I resum the trowel, 
and finish without interrupt the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh 
tier. the wall wa now nearli upon a level with my breast. I again 
paused, and hold the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few 
feebl ray upon the figur within. 

A success of loud and shrill screams, burst suddenli from the 
throat of the chain form, seem to thrust me violent back. for a 
brief moment I hesitated--i trembled. unsheath my rapier, I began 
to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant 
reassur me. I place my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, 
and felt satisfied. I reapproach the wall; I repli to the yell of 
him who clamoured. I re-echoed--i aided--i surpass them in volum 
and in strength. I did this, and the clamour grew still. 

It wa now midnight, and my task wa draw to a close. I had 
complet the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finish a 
portion of the last and the eleventh; there remain but a singl stone 
to be fit and plaster in. I struggl with it weight; I place 
it partial in it destin position. but now there came from out the 
nich a low laugh that erect the hair upon my head. It wa 
succeed by a sad voice, which I had difficulti in recogn as that 
of the nobl fortunato. the voic said-- 

"ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a veri good joke indeed--an excel jest. 
We shall have mani a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! 
he!--ov our wine--he! he! he!" 

"the amontillado!" I said. 

"he! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the amontillado. but is it not get 
late? will not they be await us at the palazzo, the ladi fortunato 
and the rest? let us be gone." 

"yes," I said, "let us be gone." 

"_for the love of god, montresor!_" 

"yes," I said, "for the love of god!" 

but to these word I hearken in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. 
I call aloud-- 

"fortunato!" 

No answer. I call again-- 

"fortunato--" 

No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remain apertur and 
let it fall within. there came forth in repli onli a jingl of the 
bells. My heart grew sick on account of the damp of the catacombs. 
I hasten to make an end of my labour. I forc the last stone into 
it position; I plaster it up. against the new masonri I re-erect 
the old rampart of bones. for the half of a centuri no mortal ha 
disturb them. _in pace requiescat!_
