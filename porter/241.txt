[sidenote: _A curiou and terrifi stori about an artist who sold hi 
soul that he might paint a live picture_] 


I had come to the art museum to see the special show of goya prints, but 
that particular galleri wa so crowd that I could hardli get in, much 
less see or savor anything; wherefor I walk out again. I wander 
through the other wing with their row and row of oils, their greek 
and roman sculptures, their stern rank of mediev armors, their 
orient porcelains, their egyptian gods. At length, by chanc and not 
by design, I came to the head of a certain rear stairway. other habitué 
of the museum will know the one I mean when I remind them that arnold 
böcklin' _the isl of the dead_ hang on the wall of the landing. 

I start down, relish in advanc the impress böcklin' pictur 
would make with it high brown rock and black poplars, it midnight sky 
and gloomi film of sea, it singl white figur erect in the bow of the 
beach-nos skiff. but, as I descended, I saw that _the isl of the 
dead_ wa not in it accustom posit on the wall. In that space, 
arrest even in the bad light and from the up-angl of the stairs, 
hung a gilt-fram paint I had never seen or heard of in all my 
museum-haunt years. 

I gaze at it, one will imagine, all the way down to the landing. then I 
had a close, search look, and a final apprais stare from the lip 
of the land abov the lower half of the flight. So far as I can 
learn--and I have been dilig in my research--th thing is unknown 
even to the best-inform of art experts. perhap it is as well that I 
describ it in detail. 

It seem to repres action upon a small plateau or tabl rock, drab 
and bare, with a twilight sky deepen into a starless evening. thi 
setting, restrainedli work up in blue-gray and blue-blacks, wa not 
the first thing to catch the eye, however. the front of the pictur wa 
fill with live danc creatures, as pink, plump and nake as 
cherub and as patent evil as the medit of satan in hi rare 
idl moments. 

I count those dancers. there were twelv of them, rang in a 
half-circle, and they were cavort in evid glee around a central 
object--a prone cross, which appear to be made of two stout log with 
some of the bark still upon them. To thi cross a pair of the pink 
things--that make fourteen--kneel and swing blocky-look 
hammer or mauls, spike a human figure. 

I say _human_ when I speak of that figure, and I withhold the word in 
describ the dancer and their hammer-wield fellows. there is a 
reason. the supin victim on the cross wa a beauti repres 
male body, as clear and anatom correct as an illustr in a 
surgic textbook. the head wa writh around, as if in pain, and I 
could not see the face or it expression; but in the tortur tens 
of the muscles, in the slati white sheen of the skin with jag streak 
of vivid gore upon it, agon natur wa plain and doubli plain. I 
could almost see the paint limb writh against the transfix nails. 

By the same token, the dancer and hammer were so dynam done as 
to seem half in motion befor my eyes. So much for the sound skill of 
the painter. yet, where the crucifi prison wa all clarity, these 
other were all fog. No lines, no angles, no muscles--their featur 
could not be seen or sensed. I wa not even sure if they had hair or 
not. It wa as if each wa pick out with a ray of light in that 
surround dusk, light that reveal and yet shimmer indistinctly; 
light, too, that had absolut noth of comfort or honesti in it. 

* * * * * 

"hold on, there!" came a sharp challeng from the stair behind and 
below me. "what are you doing? and what' that pictur doing?" 

I start so that I almost lost my foot and fell upon the 
speaker--on of the museum guards. He wa a slight old fellow and hi 
thin hair wa gray, but he advanc upon me with all the righteous, 
angri pluck of a beefi policeman. hi attitud surpris and nettl me. 

"I wa go to ask somebodi that same question," I told him as 
auster as I could manage. "what about thi picture? I thought there 
wa a böcklin hang here." 

the guard relax hi forbid attitud at first sound of my voice. 
"oh, I beg your pardon, sir. I thought you were somebodi else--th man 
who brought that thing." He nod at the picture, and the hostil glare 
came back into hi eyes. "it so happen that he talk to me first, 
then to the curator. said it wa art--great art--and the museum must 
have it." He lift hi shoulders, in a shrug or a shudder. "personally, 
I think it' plain beastly." 

So it was, I grew awar as I look at it again. "and the museum ha 
accept it at last?" I prompted. 

He shook hi head. "oh, no, sir. An hour ago he wa at the back door, 
with that nasti daub there under hi arm. I heard part of the argument. 
He got insulting, and he wa told to clear out and take hi pictur with 
him. but he must have got in here somehow, and hung it himself." walk 
close to the painting, as gingerli as though he expect the pink 
dancer to leap out at him, he point to the lower edg of the frame. 
"if it wa a real museum piece, we'd have a plate right there, with the 
name of the painter and the title." 

I, too, came close. there wa no plate, just as the guard had said. but 
in the lower left-hand corner of the canva were sprawl capitals, 
pale paint on the dark, spell out the word _golgotha_. beneath these, 
in small, bare readabl script: 

_I sold my soul that I might paint a live picture._ 

No signatur or other clue to the artist' identity. 

the guard had discov a great frame rectangl against the wall to 
one side. "here' the pictur he took down," he inform me, highli 
relieved. "help me put it back, will you, sir? and do you suppose," here 
he grew almost wistful, "that we could get rid of thi other thing 
befor someon find I let the crazi fool slip past me?" 

I took one edg of _the isl of the dead_ and lift it to help him hang 
it onc more. 

"tell you what," I offer on sudden impulse; "i'll take thi _golgotha_ 
piec home with me, if you like." 

"would you do that?" he almost yell out in hi joy at the suggestion. 
"would you, to oblig me?" 

"to oblig myself," I returned. "I need anoth pictur at my place." 

and the upshot of it was, he smuggl me and the unwant paint out 
of the museum. never mind how. I have done quit enough as it is to 
jeopard hi job and my own welcom up there. 

* * * * * 

It wa not until I had paid off my taxi and lug the unwieldi 
parallelogram of canva and wood upstair to my bachelor apart that 
I bother to wonder if it might be valuable. I never did find out, but 
from the first I wa deepli impressed. 

hung over my own fireplace, it look as larg and live as a scene 
glimps through a window or, perhaps, on a stage in a theater. the 
caper pink bodi caught new light from my lamp, light that gloss 
and intensifi their shape and color but did not reveal ani new 
details. I pore onc more over the cryptic legend: _I sold my soul that 
I might paint a live picture._ 

A live picture--wa it that? I could not answer. for all my honest 
delight in such things, I cannot be call expert or even know as 
regard art. did I even like the golgotha painting? I could not be sure 
of that, either. and the rest of the inscription, about sell a soul; 
I wa consider intrigu by that, and let my thought rambl on the 
subject of satanist complex and the vagari of half-crazi painters. 
As I read, that evening, I glanc up again and again at my new 
possession. sometim it seem ridiculous, sometim sinister. shortli 
after midnight I rose, gaze onc more, and then turn out the parlor 
lamp. for a moment, or so it seemed, I could see those dancers, so mani 
dim-pink silhouett in the sudden darkness. I went to the kitchen for a 
bit of whiski and water, and thenc to my bedroom. 

I had dreams. In them I wa a boy again, and my mother and sister were 
leav the hous to go to a theater where--think of it!--richard 
mansfield would play _beau brummell_. I, the youngest, wa told to stay 
at home and mind the troublesom furnace. I wept copious in my 
disappoint loneliness, and then mansfield himself stalk in, in full 
brummel regalia. He laugh goldenli and stretch out hi hand in warm 
greeting. I, the lad of my dreams, put out my own hand, then wa 
frighten when he would not loosen hi grasp. I tugged, and he laugh 
again. the gold of hi laughter turn suddenli hard, cold. I tug 
with all my strength, and woke. 

* * * * * 

someth held me tight by the wrist. 

* * * * * 

In my first half-moment of wake I wa awar that the room wa 
fill with the pink dancer of the picture, in nimble, fierce-happi 
motion. they were man-size, too, or nearli so, visibl in the dark with 
the dim radianc of fox-fire. On the small scale of the paint they 
had seem no more than babyishli plump; now they were gross, like huge 
erect toads. and, as I awaken fully, they were close in, a menac 
ring of them, around my bed. one stood at my right side, and it grip, 
clumsi and rubbery-hard like that of a monkey, wa close upon my arm. 

* * * * * 

I saw and sens all this, as I say, in a singl moment. with the 
sens came the realiz of peril, so great that I did not stop to 
wonder at the uncanni of my visitors. I tri frantic to jerk 
loose. for the moment I did not succeed and as I thrash about, 
throw my bodi nearli across the bed, a second dancer dash in from 
the left. It seiz and clamp my other arm. I felt, rather than heard, 
a wave of soft, wordless merriment from them all. My heart and sinew 
seem to fail, and briefli I lay still in a daze of horror, pin down 
crucifix-fashion between my two captors. 

wa that a _hammer_ rais abov me as I sprawled? 

there rush and swell into me the sudden startl strength that 
sometim favor the desperate. I scream like ani wild thing caught in 
a trap, roll somehow out of bed and to my feet. one of the be I 
shook off and the other I dash against the bureau. freed, I made for 
the bedroom door and the front of the apartment, stumbl and 
stagger on fear-weaken legs. 

one of the dim-shin pink thing bar my way at the veri threshold, 
and the other were close in behind, as if for a sudden rush. I flung 
my right fist with all my strength and weight. the be bob back 
unresistingli befor my smash, like a rubber toy float through water. 
I plung past, reach the entri and fumbl for the knob of the outer 
door. 

they were all about me then, their rubberi palm fumbl at my 
shoulders, my elbows, my pajama jacket. they would have drag me down 
befor I could negoti the lock. A rack shudder possess me and 
seem to flick them clear. then I stumbl against a stand, and pure 
by good luck my hand fell upon a bamboo walking-stick. I yell again, 
in truli hyster fierceness, and laid about me as with a whip. My 
blow did littl or no damag to those unearthli assailants, but they 
shrank back, teeter and dancing, to a safe distance. again I had the 
sens that they were laughing, mocking. for the moment I had beaten them 
off, but they were sure of me in the end. just then my grope free hand 
press a switch. the entri sprang into light. 

On the instant they were not there. 

* * * * * 

somebodi wa knock outside, and with trembl finger I turn the 
knob of the door. In came a tall, slender girl with a blue lounging-rob 
caught hurriedli around her. her bright hair wa disord as though 
she had just sprung from her bed. 

"i someon sick?" she ask in a breathless voice. "I live down the 
hall--i heard cries." her round blue eye were studi my face, which 
must have been ghastli pale. "you see, i'm a train nurse, and 
perhaps----" 

"thank god you did come!" I broke in, unceremoni but honestly, and 
went befor her to turn on everi lamp in the parlor. 

It wa she who, without guidance, search out my whiski and siphon and 
mix for me a highbal of grate strength. My teeth rang nervous on 
the edg of the glass as I gulp it down. after that I got my own 
robe--a becom one, with satin facings--and sat with her on the divan 
to tell of my adventure. when I had finished, she gaze long at the 
paint of the dancers, then back at me. her eyes, like two chip of 
the april sky, were full of concern and she held her rosi lower lip 
between her teeth. I thought that she wa wonder pretty. 

"what a perfectli terribl nightmare!" she said. 

"it wa no nightmare," I protested. 

she smile and argu the point, tell me all manner of comfort 
thing about mental associ and their reflect in vivid dreams. 

To clinch her point she turn to the painting. 

"thi line about a 'live picture' is the peg on which your slumber 
mind hung the whole fabric," she suggested, her slender fingertip 
touch the paint scribble. "your veri liter subconsci self 
didn't understand that the artist meant hi pictur would live onli 
figuratively." 

"are you sure that' what the artist meant?" I asked, but final I let 
her convinc me. one can imagin how badli I want to be convinced. 

she mix me anoth highball, and a short one for herself. over it she 
told me her name--miss dolby--and final she left me with a last 
comfort assurance. but, nightmar or no, I did not sleep again that 
night. I sat in the parlor among the lamps, smoke and dip into 
book after book. countless time I felt my gaze drawn back to the 
paint over the fireplace, with the cross and the nail-pierc wretch 
and the shimmer pink dancers. 

after the rise sun had fill the apart with it honest light and 
cheer I felt consider calmer. I slept all morning, and in the 
afternoon wa dispos to agre with miss dolbi that the whole busi 
had been a bad dream, noth more. dressing, I went down the hall, 
knock on her door and invit her to dinner with me. 

It wa a good dinner. afterward we went to an amus motion picture, 
with charl butterworth in it as I remember. after bid her 
good-night, I went to my own place. undress and in bed, I lay awake. 
My late morn slumber made my eye slow to close. thu it wa that I 
heard the faint shuffl of feet and, sit up against my pillows, saw 
the glow silhouett of the golgotha dancers. aliv and magnified, 
they were creep into my bedroom. 

I did not hesit or shrink thi time. I sprang up, tens and defiant. 

"no, you don't!" I yell at them. As they seem to hesit befor the 
impact of my wild voice, I charg frantically. for a moment I scatter 
them and got through the bedroom door, as on the previou night. there 
wa anoth shindi in the entry; thi time they all got hold of me, like 
a pack of hounds, and wrestl me back against the wall. I writh even 
now when I think of the unearthli hard of their littl grip 
paws. two on each arm were spread-eagl me upon the plaster. the 
cruciform posit again! 

I swore, yell and kicked. one of them wa in the way of my foot. He 
float back, unhurt. that wa their strength and horror--their abil 
to go flabbi and non-resist under smashing, flatten blows. 
someth tickl my palm, prick it. the point of a spike.... 

"miss dolby!" I shrieked, as a child might call for it mother. "help! 
miss d----" 

the door flew open; I must not have lock it. "here I am," came her 
unafraid reply. 

she wa outlin against the rectangl of light from the hall. My 
assail let go of me to danc toward her. she gasp but did not 
scream. I stagger along the wall, touch a light-switch, and the 
parlor just beyond us flare into visibility. miss dolbi and I ran in to 
the lamp, ralli there as stone-ag folk must have ralli at their 
fire to face the monster of the night. I look at her; she wa still 
fulli dressed, as I had left her, appar had been sit up. her 
roug made flat patch on her pale cheeks, but her eye were level. 

* * * * * 

thi time the dancer did not retreat or vanish; they lurk in the 
compar gloom of the entry, jig and trembl as if muster 
their power and resolut for anoth rush at us. 

"you see," I chatter out to her, "it wasn't a nightmare." 

she spoke, not in reply, but as if to herself. "they have no faces," she 
whispered. "no faces!" In the half-light that wa diffus upon them 
from our lamp they present the featureless of so mani huge 
gingerbread boys, cover with pink icing. one of them, some kind of 
leader, press forward within the circl of the light. It daunt him a 
bit. He hesitated, but did not retreat. 

from my center tabl miss dolbi had pick up a bright paper-cutter. she 
pois it with the assur of one who know how to handl cut 
instruments. 

"when they come," she said steadily, "let' stand close together. we'll 
be harder to drag down that way." 

I want to shout my admir of her fearless front toward the 
dread beings, my thank for her quick run to my rescue. all I 
could mumbl was, "you'r mighti brave." 

she turn for a moment to look at the pictur abov my die fire. My 
eye follow hers. I think I expect to see a blank canvas--find that 
the paint dancer had vanish from it and had grown into the live 
ones. but they were still in the picture, and the cross and the victim 
were there, too. miss dolbi read aloud the inscription: 

"_a live picture_ ... the artist knew what he wa talk about, after 
all." 

"couldn't a live pictur be killed?" I wondered. 

It sound uncertain, and a childish quibbl to boot, but miss dolbi 
exclaim triumphantly, as at an inspiration. 

"killed? yes!" she shouted. she sprang at the picture, dart out with 
the paper-cutter. the point rip into one of the central figur in 
the danc semicircle. 

all the crowd in the entri seem to give a concert throb, as of 
startl protest. I swung, heart racing, to front them again. what had 
happened? someth had changed, I saw. the intrepid leader had 
vanished. no, he had not drawn back into the group. He had vanished. 

miss dolby, too, had seen. she struck again, gash the paint 
represent of anoth dancer. and thi time the vanish happen 
befor my eyes, a creatur at the rear of the group went out of 
exist as suddenli and complet as though a light had blink out. 

the others, driven by their danger, rushed. 

I met them, feet planted. I tri to embrac them all at once, went over 
backward under them. I struck, wrenched, tore. I think I even bit 
someth grisli and bloodless, like fungoid tissue, but I refus to 
rememb for certain. one or two of the form struggl past me and 
grappl miss dolby. I struggl to my feet and pull them back from 
her. there were not so mani swarm after me now. I fought hard befor 
they got me down again. and miss dolbi kept tear and stab at the 
canvas--again, again. clutch melt from my throat, my arms. there 
were onli two dancer left. I flung them back and rose. onli one left. 
then none. 

they were gone, gone into nowhere. 

"that did it," said miss dolbi breathlessly. 

she had pull the pictur down. It wa onli a frame now, with rag 
ribbon of canva dangl from it. 

I snatch it out of her hand and threw it upon the coal of the fire. 

"look," I urg her joyfully. "it' burning! that' the end. Do you 
see?" 

"yes, I see," she answer slowly. "some fiend-ridden artist--hi evil 
geniu brought it to life." 

"the inscript is the liter truth, then?" I supplied. 

"truth no more." she bent to watch the burning. "a the paint figur 
were destroyed, their incarn faded." 

We said noth further, but sat down togeth and gaze as the flame 
ate the last thread of fabric, the last splinter of wood. final we 
look up again and smile at each other. 

all at onc I knew that I love her.
