the mummy' foot 

By théophil gautier 

translat By lafcadio hearn 

1908 


I had entered, in an idl mood, the shop of one of those curios 
vender who are call _marchand de bric-à-brac_ in that parisian 
_argot_ which is so perfectli unintellig elsewher in france. 

you have doubtless glanc occasion through the window of some of 
these shops, which have becom so numer now that it is fashion 
to buy antiqu furniture, and that everi petti stockbrok think he 
must have hi _chambr au moyen âge_. 

there is one thing there which cling alik to the shop of the dealer 
in old iron, the ware-room of the tapestri maker, the laboratori of the 
chemist, and the studio of the painter: in all those gloomi den where 
a furtiv daylight filter in through the window-shutt the most 
manifestli ancient thing is dust. the cobweb are more authent 
than the gimp laces, and the old pear-tre furnitur on exhibit is 
actual younger than the mahogani which arriv but yesterday from 
america. 

the warehous of my bric-à-brac dealer wa a verit capharnaum. all 
age and all nation seem to have made their rendezv there. An 
etruscan lamp of red clay stood upon a boul cabinet, with eboni panels, 
brightli stripe by line of inlaid brass; a duchess of the court of 
loui xv. nonchalantli extend her fawn-lik feet under a massiv 
tabl of the time of loui xiii., with heavi spiral support of oak, and 
carven design of chimera and foliag intermingled. 

upon the denticul shelv of sever sideboard glitter immens 
japanes dish with red and blue design reliev by gild hatching, 
side by side with enamel work by bernard palissy, repres 
serpents, frogs, and lizard in relief. 

from disembowel cabinet escap cascad of silver-lustr chines 
silk and wave of tinsel, which an obliqu sunbeam shot through with 
lumin beads, while portrait of everi era, in frame more or less 
tarnished, smile through their yellow varnish. 

the stripe breastplat of a damascen suit of milanes armour 
glitter in one corner; love and nymph of porcelain, chines 
grotesques, vase of _céladon_ and crackleware, saxon and old sèvre 
cup encumb the shelv and nook of the apartment. 

the dealer follow me close through the tortuou way contriv 
between the pile of furniture, ward off with hi hand the hazard 
sweep of my coat-skirts, watch my elbow with the uneasi attent of 
an antiquarian and a usurer. 

It wa a singular face, that of the merchant; an immens skull, polish 
like a knee, and surround by a thin aureol of white hair, which 
brought out the clear salmon tint of hi complexion all the more 
strikingly, lent him a fals aspect of patriarch _bonhomie_, 
counteracted, however, by the scintil of two littl yellow eye 
which trembl in their orbit like two louis-d'or upon quicksilver. the 
curv of hi nose present an aquilin silhouette, which suggest the 
orient or jewish type. hi hands--thin, slender, full of nerv which 
project like string upon the finger-board of a violin, and arm with 
claw like those on the termin of bats' wings--shook with senil 
trembling; but those convuls agit hand becam firmer 
than steel pincer or lobsters' claw when they lift ani preciou 
article--an onyx cup, a venetian glass, or a dish of bohemian crystal. 
thi strang old man had an aspect so thoroughli rabbin and 
cabalist that he would have been burnt on the mere testimoni of hi 
face three centuri ago. 

'will you not buy someth from me to-day, sir? here is a malay krees 
with a blade undul like flame. look at those groov contriv for 
the blood to run along, those teeth set backward so as to tear out the 
entrail in withdraw the weapon. It is a fine charact of feroci 
arm, and will look well in your collection. thi two-hand sword 
is veri beautiful. It is the work of josep de la hera; and thi 
_colichemarde_ with it fenestr guard--what a superb specimen of 
handicraft!' 

'no; I have quit enough weapon and instrument of carnage. I want a 
small figure,--someth which will suit me as a paper-weight, for I 
cannot endur those trumperi bronz which the station sell, and 
which may be found on everybody' desk.' 

the old gnome forag among hi ancient wares, and final arrang 
befor me some antiqu bronzes, so-cal at least; fragment of 
malachite, littl hindoo or chines idols, a kind of poussah-toy in 
jade-stone, repres the incarn of brahma or vishnoo, and 
wonder appropri to the veri undivin offic of hold paper 
and letter in place. 

I wa hesit between a porcelain dragon, all constel with 
warts, it mouth formid with bristl tusk and rang of 
teeth, and an abomin littl mexican fetich, repres the god 
vitziliputzili _au naturel_, when I caught sight of a charm foot, 
which I at first took for a fragment of some antiqu venus. 

It had those beauti ruddi and tawni tint that lend to florentin 
bronz that warm live look so much prefer to the gray-green aspect 
of common bronzes, which might easili be mistaken for statu in a state 
of putrefaction. satini gleam play over it round forms, doubtless 
polish by the amor kiss of twenti centuries, for it seem a 
corinthian bronze, a work of the best era of art, perhap mould by 
lysippu himself. 

'that foot will be my choice,' said to the merchant, who regard me 
with an iron and saturnin air, and held out the object desir that 
I might examin it more fully. 

I wa surpris at it lightness. It wa not a foot of metal, but in 
sooth a foot of flesh, an embalm foot, a mummy' foot. On examin 
it still more close the veri grain of the skin, and the almost 
impercept line impress upon it by the textur of the bandages, 
becam perceptible. the toe were slender and delicate, and termin 
by perfectli form nails, pure and transpar as agates. the great 
toe, slightli separ from the rest, afford a happi contrast, in the 
antiqu style, to the posit of the other toes, and lent it an aerial 
lightness--th grace of a bird' foot. the sole, scarc streak by 
a few almost impercept cross lines, afford evid that it had 
never touch the bare ground, and had onli come in contact with the 
finest mat of nile rush and the softest carpet of panther skin. 

'ha, ha, you want the foot of the princess hermonthis!' exclaim the 
merchant, with a strang giggle, fix hi owlish eye upon me. 'ha, 
ha, ha! for a paper-weight! An origin idea!--artist idea!-old 
pharaoh would certainli have been surpris had some one told him that 
the foot of hi ador daughter would be use for a paper-weight after 
he had had a mountain of granit hollow out as a receptacl for 
the tripl coffin, paint and gilded, cover with hieroglyph and 
beauti paint of the judgment of souls,' continu the queer 
littl merchant, half audibly, as though talk to himself. 

'how much will you charg me for thi mummi fragment?' 

'ah, the highest price I can get, for it is a superb piece. If I had the 
match of it you could not have it for less than five hundr francs. the 
daughter of a pharaoh! noth is more rare.' 

'assuredli that is not a common article, but still, how much do you 
want? In the first place let me warn you that all my wealth consist of 
just five louis. I can buy anyth that cost five louis, but noth 
dearer. you might search my vest pocket and most secret drawer without 
even find one poor five-franc piec more.' 

'five loui for the foot of the princess hermonthis! that is veri 
little, veri littl indeed. 'ti an authent foot,' mutter the 
merchant, shake hi head, and impart a peculiar rotari motion to 
hi eyes. 'well, take it, and I will give you the bandag into the 
bargain,' he added, wrap the foot in an ancient damask rag. 'veri 
fine? real damask--indian damask which ha never been redyed. It is 
strong, and yet it is soft,' he mumbled, stroke the fray tissu with 
hi fingers, through the trade-acquir habit which move him to prais 
even an object of such littl valu that he himself deem it onli worth 
the give away. 

He pour the gold coin into a sort of mediaev alms-purs hang at 
hi belt, repeating: 

'the foot of the princess hermonthi to be use for a paper-weight!' 

then turn hi phosphoresc eye upon me, he exclaim in a voic 
strident as the cri of a cat which ha swallow a fish-bone: 

'old pharaoh will not be well pleased. He love hi daughter, the dear 
man!' 

'you speak as if you were a contemporari of his. you are old enough, 
good knows! but you do not date back to the pyramid of egypt,' I 
answered, laughingly, from the threshold. 

I went home, delight with my acquisition. 

with the idea of put it to profit use as soon as possible, I 
place the foot of the divin princess hermonthi upon a heap of paper 
scribbl over with verses, in themselv an undecipher mosaic work 
of erasures; articl freshli begun; letter forgotten, and post 
in the tabl drawer instead of the letter-box, an error to which 
absent-mind peopl are peculiarli liable. the effect wa charming, 
_bizarre_, and romantic. 

well satisfi with thi embellishment, I went out with the graviti and 
pride becom one who feel that he ha the ineff advantag over 
all the passers-bi whom he elbows, of possess a piec of the princess 
hermonthis, daughter of pharaoh. 

I look upon all who did not possess, like myself, a paper-weight so 
authent egyptian as veri ridicul people, and it seem to me 
that the proper occup of everi sensibl man should consist in the 
mere fact of have a mummy' foot upon hi desk. 

happili I met some friends, whose presenc distract me in my 
infatu with thi new acquisition. I went to dinner with them, for I 
could not veri well have dine with myself. 

when I came back that evening, with my brain slightli confus by a few 
glass of wine, a vagu whiff of orient perfum delic titil 
my olfactori nerves. the heat of the room had warm the natron, 
bitumen, and myrrh in which the _paraschistes_, who cut open the bodi 
of the dead, had bath the corps of the princess. It wa a perfum at 
onc sweet and penetrating, a perfum that four thousand year had not 
been abl to dissipate. 

the dream of egypt wa eternity. her odour have the solid of granit 
and endur as long. 

I soon drank deepli from the black cup of sleep. for a few hour all 
remain opaqu to me. oblivion and nothing inund me with their 
sombr waves. 

yet light gradual dawn upon the dark of my mind. dream 
commenc to touch me softli in their silent flight. 

the eye of my soul were opened, and I beheld my chamber as it actual 
was. I might have believ myself awak but for a vagu conscious 
which assur me that I slept, and that someth fantast wa about to 
take place. 

the odour of the myrrh had augment in intensity, and I felt a slight 
headache, which I veri natur attribut to sever glass of 
champagn that we had drunk to the unknown god and our futur fortunes. 

I peer through my room with a feel of expect which I saw 
noth to justify. everi articl of furnitur wa in it proper place. 
the lamp, softli shade by it globe of ground crystal, burn upon it 
bracket; the water-colour sketch shone under their bohemian glass; 
the curtain hung down languidly; everyth wore an aspect of tranquil 
slumber. 

after a few moments, however, all thi calm interior appear to becom 
disturbed. the woodwork crack stealthily, the ash-cov log suddenli 
emit a jet of blue flame, and the disc of the patera seem like 
great metal eyes, watching, like myself, for the thing which were 
about to happen. 

My eye accident fell upon the desk where I had place the foot of 
the princess hermonthis. 

instead of remain quiet, as behov a foot which had been embalm 
for four thousand years, it commenc to act in a nervou manner, 
contract itself, and leap over the paper like a startl frog. one 
would have imagin that it had suddenli been brought into contact with 
a galvan battery. I could distinctli hear the dri sound made by it 
littl heel, hard as the hoof of a gazelle. 

I becam rather discont with my acquisition, inasmuch as I wish 
my paper-weight to be of a sedentari disposition, and thought it veri 
unnatur that feet should walk about without legs, and I commenc to 
experi a feel close akin to fear. 

suddenli I saw the fold of my bed-curtain stir, and heard a bump 
sound, like that caus by some person hop on one foot across the 
floor. I must confess I becam altern hot and cold, that I felt a 
strang wind chill my back, and that my suddenli rise hair caus my 
night-cap to execut a leap of sever yards. 

the bed-curtain open and I beheld the strangest figur imagin 
befor me. 

It wa a young girl of a veri deep coffee-brown complexion, like the 
bayadèr amani, and possess the purest egyptian type of perfect 
beauty. her eye were almond shape and oblique, with eyebrow so black 
that they seem blue; her nose wa exquisit chiselled, almost greek 
in it delicaci of outline; and she might inde have been taken for a 
corinthian statu of bronz but for the promin of her cheek-bon 
and the slightli african ful of her lips, which compel one to 
recognis her as belong beyond all doubt to the hieroglyph race 
which dwelt upon the bank of the nile. 

her arms, slender and spindle-shap like those of veri young girls, 
were encircl by a peculiar kind of metal band and bracelet of glass 
beads; her hair wa all twist into littl cords, and she wore upon 
her bosom a littl idol-figur of green paste, bear a whip with seven 
lashes, which prove it to be an imag of isis; her brow wa adorn 
with a shine plate of gold, and a few trace of paint reliev the 
copperi tint of her cheeks. 

As for her costume, it wa veri odd indeed. 

fanci a _pagne_, or skirt, all form of littl strip of materi 
bedizen with red and black hieroglyphics, stiffen with bitumen, and 
appar belong to a freshli unbandag mummy. 

In one of those sudden flight of thought so common in dream I 
heard the hoars falsetto of the bric-à-brac dealer, repeat like 
a monoton refrain the phrase he had utter in hi shop with so 
enigmat an intonation: 

'old pharaoh will not be well pleas He love hi daughter, the dear 
man!' 

one strang circumstance, which wa not at all calcul to restor 
my equanimity, wa that the apparit had but one foot; the other wa 
broken off at the ankle! 

she approach the tabl where the foot wa start and fidget about 
more than ever, and there support herself upon the edg of the desk. I 
saw her eye fill with pearli gleam tears. 

although she had not as yet spoken, I fulli comprehend the thought 
which agit her. she look at her foot--for it wa inde her 
own--with an exquisit grace express of coquettish sadness, but 
the foot leap and ran hither and thither, as though impel on steel 
springs. 

twice or thrice she extend her hand to seiz it, but could not 
succeed. 

then commenc between the princess hermonthi and her foot--which 
appear to be endow with a special life of it own--a veri fantast 
dialogu in a most ancient coptic tongue, such as might have been spoken 
thirti centuri ago in the syrinx of the land of ser. luckili I 
understood coptic perfectli well that night. 

the princess hermonthi cried, in a voic sweet and vibrant as the tone 
of a crystal bell: 

'well, my dear littl foot, you alway flee from me, yet I alway 
took good care of you. I bath you with perfum water in a bowl of 
alabaster; I smooth your heel with pumice-ston mix with 
palm-oil; your nail were cut with golden scissor and polish with a 
hippopotamu tooth; I wa care to select _tatbebs_ for you, paint 
and embroid and turn up at the toes, which were the envi of all 
the young girl in egypt. you wore on your great toe ring bear the 
devic of the sacr scarabseus, and you support one of the lightest 
bodi that a lazi foot could sustain.' 

the foot repli in a pout and chagrin tone: 

'you know well that I do not belong to myself ani longer. I have been 
bought and paid for. the old merchant knew what he wa about. He bore 
you a grudg for have refus to espous him. thi is an ill turn 
which he ha done you. the arab who violat your royal coffin in the 
subterranean pit of the necropoli of thebe wa sent thither by him. 
He desir to prevent you from be present at the reunion of the 
shadowi nation in the citi below. have you five piec of gold for my 
ransom?' 

'alas, no! My jewels, my rings, my purs of gold and silver were all 
stolen from me,' answer the princess hermonthi with a sob. 

'princess,' I then exclaimed, 'I never retain anybody' foot unjustly. 
even though you have not got the five loui which it cost me, I present 
it to you gladly. I should feel unutter wretch to think that I 
were the caus of so amiabl a person as the princess hermonthi be 
lame.' 

I deliv thi discours in a royal gallant, troubadour tone which 
must have astonish the beauti egyptian girl. 

she turn a look of deepest gratitud upon me, and her eye shone with 
bluish gleam of light. 

she took her foot, which surrend itself willingli thi time, like a 
woman about to put on her littl shoe, and adjust it to her leg with 
much skill. 

thi oper over, she took a few step about the room, as though to 
assur herself that she wa realli no longer lame. 

'ah, how pleas my father will be! He who wa so unhappi becaus of my 
mutilation, and who from the moment of my birth set a whole nation at 
work to hollow me out a tomb so deep that he might preserv me intact 
until that last day when soul must be weigh in the balanc of 
amenthi! come with me to my father. He will receiv you kindly, for you 
have given me back my foot.' 

I thought thi proposit natur enough. I array myself in a 
dressing-gown of large-flow pattern, which lent me a veri pharaon 
aspect, hurriedli put on a pair of turkish slippers, and inform the 
princess hermonthi that I wa readi to follow her. 

befor starting, hermonthi took from her neck the littl idol of green 
paste, and laid it on the scatter sheet of paper which cover the 
table. 

'it is onli fair,' she observed, smilingly, 'that I should replac your 
paper-weight.' 

she gave me her hand, which felt soft and cold, like the skin of a 
serpent, and we departed. 

We pass for some time with the veloc of an arrow through a fluid 
and grayish expanse, in which half-form silhouett flit swiftli by 
us, to right and left. 

for an instant we saw onli sky and sea. 

A few moment later obelisk commenc to tower in the distance; pylon 
and vast flight of step guard by sphinx becam clearli outlin 
against the horizon. 

We had reach our destination. 

the princess conduct me to a mountain of rose-colour granite, in the 
face of which appear an open so narrow and low that it would have 
been difficult to distinguish it from the fissur in the rock, had not 
it locat been mark by two stela wrought with sculptures. 

hermonthi kindl a torch and led the way befor me. 

We travers corridor hewn through the live rock. their walls, 
cover with hieroglyph and paint of allegor processions, 
might well have occupi thousand of arm for thousand of year in 
their formation. these corridor of intermin length open into 
squar chambers, in the midst of which pit had been contrived, through 
which we descend by cramp-iron or spiral stairways. these pit again 
conduct us into other chambers, open into other corridors, likewis 
decor with paint sparrow-hawks, serpent coil in circles, the 
symbol of the _tau_ and _pedum_--prodigi work of art which no 
live eye can ever examine--intermin legend of granit which onli 
the dead have time to read through all eternity. 

At last we found ourselv in a hall so vast, so enormous, so 
immeasurable, that the eye could not reach it limits. file of 
monstrou column stretch far out of sight on everi side, between 
which twinkl livid star of yellowish flame; point of light which 
reveal further depth incalcul in the dark beyond. 

the princess hermonthi still held my hand, and gracious salut the 
mummi of her acquaintance. 

My eye becam accustom to the dim twilight, and object becam 
discernible. 

I beheld the king of the subterranean race seat upon thrones--grand 
old men, though dry, withered, wrinkl like parchment, and blacken 
with naphtha and bitumen--al wear _pshents_ of gold, and 
breastplat and gorget glitter with preciou stones, their eye 
immov fix like the eye of sphinxes, and their long beard 
whiten by the snow of centuries. behind them stood their peoples, 
in the stiff and constrain postur enjoin by egyptian art, all 
etern preserv the attitud prescrib by the hierat code. 
behind these nations, the cats, ibixes, and crocodil contemporari 
with them--rend monstrou of aspect by their swath bands--mewed, 
flap their wings, or extend their jaw in a saurian giggle. 

all the pharaoh were there--cheops, chephrenes, psammetichus, 
sesostris, amenotaph--al the dark ruler of the pyramid and syrinxes. 
On yet higher throne sat chrono and xixouthros, who wa contemporari 
with the deluge, and tubal cain, who reign befor it. 

the beard of king xixouthro had grown seven time around the granit 
tabl upon which he leaned, lost in deep reverie, and buri in dreams. 

further back, through a dusti cloud, I beheld dimli the seventy-two 
pre-adamit kings, with their seventy-two peoples, for ever pass away. 

after permit me to gaze upon thi bewild spectacl a few 
moments, the princess hermonthi present me to her father pharaoh, who 
favour me with a most graciou nod. 

'I have found my foot again! I have found my foot!' cri the princess, 
clap her littl hand togeth with everi sign of frantic joy. 'it 
wa thi gentleman who restor it to me.' 

the race of kemi, the race of nahasi--al the black, bronzed, and 
copper-colour nation repeat in chorus: 

'the princess hermonthi ha found her foot again!' 

even xixouthro himself wa visibl affected. 

He rais hi heavi eyelids, stroke hi moustach with hi fingers, and 
turn upon me a glanc weighti with centuries. 

'bi oms, the dog of hell, and tmei, daughter of the sun and of truth, 
thi is a brave and worthi lad!' exclaim pharaoh, point to me with 
hi sceptre, which wa termin with a lotus-flower. 

'what recompens do you desire?' 

fill with that dare inspir by dream in which noth seem 
impossible, I ask him for the hand of the princess hermonthis. the 
hand seem to me a veri proper antithet recompens for the foot. 

pharaoh open wide hi great eye of glass in astonish at my witti 
request. 

'what countri do you come from, and what is your age?' 

'I am a frenchman, and I am twenty-seven year old vener pharaoh.' 

'twenty-seven year old, and he wish to espous the princess 
hermonthi who is thirti centuri old!' cri out at onc all the 
throne and all the circl of nations. 

onli hermonthi herself did not seem to think my request unreasonable. 

'if you were even onli two thousand year old,' repli the ancient 
king, 'I would willingli give you the princess, but the disproport 
is too great; and, besides, we must give our daughter husband who will 
last well. you do not know how to preserv yourselv ani longer. even 
those who die onli fifteen centuri ago are alreadi no more than a 
hand of dust. behold, my flesh is solid as basalt, my bone are bar 
of steel! 

'I will be present on the last day of the world with the same bodi and 
the same featur which I had dure my lifetime. My daughter hermonthi 
will last longer than a statu of bronze. 

'then the last particl of your dust will have been scatter abroad 
by the winds, and even isi herself, who wa abl to find the atom of 
osiris, would scarc be abl to recompos your being. 

'see how vigor I yet remain, and how mighti is my grasp,' he added, 
shake my hand in the english fashion with a strength that buri my 
ring in the flesh of my fingers. 

He squeez me so hard that I awoke, and found my friend alfr shake 
me by the arm to make me get up. 

'oh, you everlast sleeper! must I have you carri out into the 
middl of the street, and firework explod in your ears? It is 
afternoon. don't you recollect your promis to take me with you to see 
M. aguado' spanish pictures?' 

'god! I forgot all, all about it,' I answered, dress myself 
hurriedly. 'we will go there at once. I have the permit lie there on 
my desk.' 

I start to find it, but fanci my astonish when I beheld, instead 
of the mummy' foot I had purchas the even before, the littl green 
past idol left in it place by the princess hermonthis!
