london — the moment ha arrived. britain is out of the european union. prime minist bori johnson and hi "people’ government" — it scarc call itself conserv at thi point — ha fulfil the promis on which it wa elect in decemb and "got brexit done." 

there are difficulti ahead. mr. johnson ha promis imposs and contradictori thing on brexit: maximum regulatori freedom where it suit hi government, maximum frictionless trade where it suit the british economy. the european union is unlik to give him what he want in the month of negoti to come. 

but by fulfil hi pledge, mr. johnson ha won enorm good will from nationalist voter across england and wales. outsid the european union, he will also have more scope to chang the british government’ role in the economy. thi give him a uniqu opportun do what hi predecessor could not: build a last popular base for the conserv party. mr. johnson can now take advantag of hi big major to overhaul british capitalism, incentiv long-term conserv voter while perman annex chunk of the labour party’ histor base. 

already, the dimens of mr. johnson’ plan are becom clear. He ha no intent of run the countri as ani conserv leader sinc margaret thatcher would have: He is not out to roll back the state. instead, he is out to secur the support of working-class voter who hand over to the tori dozen of seat formerli held by labour. hi premiership, set free by brexit, could reshap britain’ elector map for decades. 

dure the election, mr. johnson campaign as an almost single-issu nationalist, the phrase "get brexit done" fall robot from hi lip between everi other stammer. beyond that, much of what he said wa convent tory: He promis harsher restrict on immigration, mean an end to free movement from the european union and the expans of the "hostil environment" for migrants. domest repression, the manifesto promised, would also tighten, with a bigger penal system and a greater emphasi on "counter-extremism," which, as home secretari priti patel ha indicated, will target part of the left. mr. johnson ha also hint at constitut reforms, which would strengthen the execut and weaken judici challenges. He promis an attack on liber norm and legal in the name of nation invigoration. 

tellingly, he distanc himself from the last government. He would end austerity, rais spend on the nation health service, guarante pensions, rais the minimum wage and borrow £100 billion to invest in infrastructure. mani of these promis were grossli exaggerated, but they serv to underlin the point that a johnson administr would be different. and sinc the election, the govern ha act to carri out it commitments, pass legisl to guarante n.h.s. spend increas and propos moder improv to workers’ and renters’ rights. It ha also promis that most of the infrastructur spend will be invest in england’ depriv northern region — and thi week back up the promis by nation the north’ major rail service. 

If thi sound like an incurs into labour territory, it is. mani of the polici are directli taken from labour’ plans. the push for a larger state reson with a polit ambigu popular memori of the postwar era — a certain nostalgia for the era of big, dynam industri own by the british govern inflect both a version of the left-w polit of the labour parti leader, jeremi corbyn, and a version of brexit sentiment. mr. johnson know that mani of the vote contribut to a conserv major were "lent" by voter who want brexit done. A more interventionist state is a way to shore up a lasting, broad coalition. 

thi pragmat raid on enemi turf wa first conceiv under mr. johnson’ predecessor, theresa may. more thought tori knew they had to change. the british state and economi had becom dysfunctional: gape region inequalities, a hous market inaccess to younger workers, weak labor productivity, sluggish invest and veri littl to export. mrs. may’ advis understood that the conserv had to break with the formula of auster and financi somehow. 

but while she use the rhetor of working-class uplift, she wa unabl to back it up with policy. her chancellor, philip hammond, a tradit alli of the banks, wa determin to keep auster going. If noth else, he could see no other way to creat a fiscal surplu big enough to soften the impact of brexit. mr. johnson, by contrast, is just enough of an opportunist to see that deliv brexit, in howev self-injur and punit a form, give him both the polit power and the regulatori latitud to do thing differently. 

there is a risk, though, of succumb to mr. johnson’ own mythmaking. As much as he need working-class conservatives, they have alway existed. and the core tori voter remain the affluent middl class. what’ more, when it come to public spending, he’ limit in what he can do by hi commit to freez most taxes. In an economi that is alreadi weak and like to be weaker after brexit, he ha littl room for seriou investment. 

and mr. johnson will face conflict demand from within hi own party. the chancellor, sajid javid, ha demand 5 percent cut from most govern departments, make plain that the spend spigot are not about to freeli flow. and the prime minist is surround by alli who, far from want a more interventionist state, want to cut tax and slash regul in the interest of a more global competit economy. 

dure the election, mr. johnson wa abl to glide over the glare contradict in what he said with a bustl con man’ charm, but in offic he ha to navig them. with a big majority, he can no longer play the outsider. however, the lesson of nationalist leader global is that, in thi jitteri era, they don’t have to deliv boom success to keep power. from viktor orban in hungari to narendra modi in india, these leader have expand their base by deliv a personalized, charismat form of rule in which they are milit defend of the nation against all comer — be they foreigners, "traitors," liberals, or leftists. 

mr. johnson is not a nationalist by conviction. He is the epitom of the "reckless opportunists" that, as the sociologist aeron davi says, run britain. hi vote record in parliament show him to be slightli more liber than hi party. but hi perform over the last few month — dure which he agit against parliament, accus oppon of "collaboration" with europe, and saber-rattl against the court and media — show him to be adept at use the far right’ template. whenev the contradict in hi govern threaten to unravel, he is like to return to these tactics. 

indeed, brexit fit in with that method perfectly. after today, mr. johnson will be abl to continu remind voter that he wa abl to overcom the hostil of the liber elit and accomplish hi goal. and as negoti proceed, he can gin up hostil against hi suppos enemi whenev he doesn’t get hi way. 

whenev ani politician claim to speak for "the people," someon alway pay the price. migrant are first on the list for mr. johnson. but they will not be the last.
