A Grinch Steals a Bank and Fires an Angel By Nicholas Kristof Feb. 1, 2020  To understand how some companies have lost their souls, consider what happened after U.S. Bank stiffed a customer before Christmas.
Marc Eugenio had deposited a $1,080 paycheck into his account at U.S. Bank.
The bank put a hold on most of the sum, and he spent many hours in a branch office over two days, trying to get access to the money so he could buy presents for his 9-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son.
On Christmas Eve, Eugenio found himself parked at a gas station in Clackamas, Ore., a Portland suburb, both his fuel gauge and his bank balance on empty.
A bank employee had told him that money would soon show up in his account â€” perhaps a ruse to get him out of the branch office.
For hours Eugenio then tried his debit card at the gas pump, so he could buy a few gallons and get home to his wife and children.
â€œI was stranded,â€ he told me.
â€œI could have walked home, but it would have been five miles in the cold.â€  Thatâ€™s when Eugenio found an angel.
He telephoned the bankâ€™s toll-free number and spoke with Emily James, a senior officer at a call center in Portland.
She spent an hour on the phone with Eugenio, trying to get some money released so he could at least get home.
She soon realized that he had been misled, and that money wouldnâ€™t reach his account any time soon.
Feeling badly for a customer stuck on Christmas Eve, James offered to drive over from her call center and personally hand him $20.
â€œNo, no, no,â€ Eugenio told her.
He couldnâ€™t impose.
But she suggested she could use her break, and she received permission from a supervisor to drive 20 minutes to Eugenio.
She later recalled that when she arrived, she wished him Merry Christmas and handed him $20 of her own money.
â€œTwenty dollars wouldnâ€™t break me,â€ she explained to me, â€œand it would enable him to get home to his family.â€  When U.S. Bank found out that it had such a generous employee, what did it do?
It fired her.
â€œShe broke the rules, putting herself and the bank at unnecessary risk,â€ U.S. Bank said in a statement.
The company bars call center workers from meeting customers, so it dismissed both her and the manager who had approved her trip.
The manager, Abigail Gilbert, told me that Jamesâ€™s account was essentially correct.
James had worked at the bank since 2017 and had received numerous commendations and awards that I examined, but the bank paid her no severance.
She is single and used her last paycheck to buy sacks of food for her two dogs, Domino and Harley Quinn.
She is now reduced to selling blood plasma, at $25 a visit.
â€œI wonâ€™t let myself be homeless,â€ she told me.
Eugenio is horrified at what happened.
â€œI was lied to and treated like dirtâ€ by the bank, Eugenio said, and he canâ€™t understand why the bank axed the one employee who was helpful.
â€œI felt really bad,â€ he told me.
â€œHow could she get fired?â€  U.S. Bankâ€™s vision statement boasts: â€œOur employees are empowered to do the right thing.â€ So I tried to ask the companyâ€™s C.E.O., Andrew Cecere, why the bank fired an employee who, with permission, rescued a frustrated customer on Christmas Eve.
Cecere wouldnâ€™t return my calls.
David Palombi, a bank spokesman, told me that an internal â€œinvestigationâ€ had concluded that James misled her manager to get permission, that James could have found other ways to get money to Eugenio, that the $20 came from the manager (which Gilbert confirmed to me) and that James previously had disciplinary â€œissues.â€ I found the bankâ€™s â€œinvestigationâ€ a whitewash and its explanations to be incoherent, meanspirited and contradicted by a series of internal bank messages that I reviewed.
The bottom line is this: Cecere, who was paid $14.1 million in 2018, presides over a company that has smeared a much-decorated employee who helped a customer and as a result survives by selling blood plasma.
I suggest Cecere apologize, reinstate James and promote her; he might also show contrition by selling his own blood plasma and donating the proceeds to a charity of Jamesâ€™s choosing.
When young Americans say in polls that they react more positively to â€œsocialismâ€ than to â€œcapitalism,â€ itâ€™s because of the hypocrisy of institutions like U.S. Bank.
Iâ€™ve often noted that companies have enormous capacity to help their communities.
But too often they act like American tobacco companies, which killed more people than Stalin did, or pharma companies peddling opioids, or McKinsey & Company advising a business to â€œget more patients on higher doses of opioids,â€ or Boeing mocking regulators.
Thatâ€™s one reason to seek stronger private-sector labor unions: At least unions and corporations can then provide some check on each other.
One bit of reassurance: Some chief executives do seem more enlightened than Cecere.
After The Oregonian wrote two excellent articles about James, other companies reached out to her, saying that sheâ€™s the kind of caring person they want to attract.
â€œNo job offers yet,â€ she told me, â€œbut there are a couple of possibilities Iâ€™m really excited by.â€ Brexit Is Here!
Sort Of By The Editorial Board Jan. 31, 2020  Finally, after 1,317 days of confusion, rancor and endless votes in Parliament, it was time for Brexit.
On Wednesday, teary members of the European Parliament joined hands and sang â€œAuld Lang Syne,â€ a clock projected onto 10 Downing Street counted down the minutes, Union Jacks lined the Mall before Buckingham Palace.
â€œA new dawn for Europe,â€ leaders of the European Union wrote in a joint article.
â€œThis is the moment when the dawn breaks,â€ came Prime Minister Boris Johnsonâ€™s echo from across the newly raised dividing line.
It was left to the dispassionate BBC to cut short the bathos: â€œBrexit is far from â€˜done,â€™â€ the Beeb coldly said, before listing the many travails still to come, most notably the negotiations that now begin with the E.U.
on the details of Britainâ€™s future relationship with the Continent.
Mr. Johnson has promised not to seek an extension of the Dec. 31 deadline, which he could, though a less complex trade deal between the E.U.
and Canada took seven years to finish.
To discourage other members from exiting, the E.U.
is not likely to cut Britain much slack on E.U.
standards and rules in their trade.
Britain will now also reach across the Atlantic to what President Trump has held out as a â€œvery big trade deal, bigger than weâ€™ve ever had with the U.K.,â€ which Mr. Johnson has touted as a benefit of quitting the E.U.
That, too, could prove a disappointment.
A former British ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch â€” who resigned in July after his derogatory comments about Mr. Trump leaked out â€” was among those who noted in interviews that Mr. Trump is not given to generous trade concessions, least of all in an election year.
In the same European Parliament session at which Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the E.U.
Commission, promised departing British delegates, â€œWe will always love you, and we will never be far,â€ Aileen McLeod of the Scottish National Party spoke of Scotlandâ€™s anger over being â€œdraggedâ€ out of the union and asked that the members â€œleave a light onâ€ for Scotland, where Brexit has fueled demands for a new referendum on independence.
Still, the fact was that after 47 years in the E.U., Britain was officially out, and there was no going back, at least not in the foreseeable future.
For many Britons, the long and bitter debate had been less about economics and politics than about identity.
Those who fought to leave the E.U.
fought for what they saw as lost sovereignty, often tinged with a sense of lost empire; those who fought to stay saw the Union as post-imperial Britainâ€™s place in the future, joined with the rest of Europe in values, standards and security.
In the end, after nearly three years of uncertainty and bitterness, voters elected Mr. Johnson out of exhaustion, to get it over with, not because they had reached agreement.
Headlines reflected the divide.
Pro-Brexit tabloids joined in gleeful celebration: â€œOUR TIME HAS COME,â€ proclaimed The Sun, offering a â€œfree giant Brexit posterâ€; â€œYES, WE DID IT!â€ cheered The Daily Express in what it described as a historic edition; â€œFree and independent once more after 47 years,â€ declared The Daily Mail over a photograph of the white cliffs of Dover.
Those same cliffs featured on the cover of The Guardian, a strong advocate of staying in the E.U., over a crumbling sand castle surmounted by a tiny British flag.
The headline: â€œSmall island.â€  Trying to reconcile these divergent worldviews will be the main task of coming years, as Mr. Johnson appeared to recognize when he declared in a speech to the nation Friday evening: â€œOur job as the government, my job, is to bring this country together now and take us forward.
â€¦ This is not an end but a beginning.â€  For the moment, what â€œforwardâ€ meant remained unclear.
For at least the coming years not much would change in economic, trade and practical terms, but many potential battles loomed over the shape of the future relationship with Europe, America and the rest of the world.
Perhaps in paraphrasing Winston Churchill on whether the moment was an end or a beginning, Mr. Johnson would have done better to use his predecessorâ€™s entire quote, that one about a military campaign 78 years ago: â€œNow this is not the end.
It is not even the beginning of the end.
But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.â€ China Didnâ€™t Want Us to Know.
Now Its Own Files Are Doing the Talking.
By Adrian Zenz Nov. 24, 2019  No more denying, no more dodging.
The Chinese Communist Party can no longer hide its relentless campaign of mass internment against the ethnic minorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, or claim that the effort is an innocuous educational program.
What was already widely known, vastly reported and confirmed by firsthand accounts has now been proved beyond doubt by the governmentâ€™s own records â€” gigabytes of files, reams of reports, thousands of spreadsheets â€” some of them classified and highly confidential.
Last weekend, The New York Times disclosed and analyzed the contents of a trove of leaked internal Chinese government documents that outline specific policies for how to repress Xinjiangâ€™s predominantly Muslim minorities â€” and reveal that President Xi Jinping himself set out the foundation for them.
This Sunday, the contents of two more sets of documents â€” all of which I have reviewed â€” are being disclosed.
Among the first batch, also leaked, is a confidential telegram signed by Zhu Hailun, Xinjiangâ€™s deputy party secretary, which details how local authorities should manage and operate the â€œvocational skills training centersâ€ â€” a euphemism for the internment camps.
(All translations here are mine.)
The second set of documents, a large cache of files and spreadsheets from local governments, reveals the internment campaignâ€™s devastating economic and social impact on the families and communities it targets.
The telegram â€” dated Nov. 5, 2017, and addressed to local political and legal affairs bureaus â€” is marked â€œextremely urgentâ€ and bears the second-highest level of secrecy within Chinaâ€™s classified-document scheme.
It reveals the extent of the security and surveillance measures taken around the camps, partly to shield the camps from external scrutiny.
The message, a directive, notes that the work conducted there is â€œstrictly confidentialâ€ and â€œhighly sensitiveâ€ in nature.
Even staff at the camps are forbidden from aggregating detainee figures.
The authoritiesâ€™ attempt to enforce absolute secrecy is confirmed by another document dated November 2018, this one from a local government file in Hotan County.
It chides officials for not â€œprotecting secretsâ€ related to the internment campaign well enough.
It stipulates that â€œno person is under any circumstances permitted to disseminate information about detention or re-education via telephone, smartphone, or the internet,â€ and that officials are â€œstrictly forbiddenâ€ from receiving â€œrelated media interviewsâ€ or make â€œunauthorized disclosureâ€ about the internment campaign.
That the Chinese authorities so deliberately sought to shield from external scrutiny information about operations at the Xinjiang camps suggests that they are only too aware of how incriminating their policies and practices are.
I was also able to obtain a massive cache of local government files from within Xinjiang.
Among the most revealing documents are thousands of detailed spreadsheets with the names, identification numbers and addresses of tens of thousands of people, mostly Uighurs and many of them in detention, prison or re-education camps.
In Yarkand, a county of about 800,000 people in southwestern Xinjiang, 96 percent of the population is Uighur.
Six official spreadsheets about six villages dated 2018 show that, on average, nearly 16 percent of the rural adult population was either interned or in prison.
In two villages in Kosherik Township â€” which the documents describe as â€œheavily polluted by extremist ideologyâ€ â€” nearly 60 percent of all households had one person or more interned.
In addition to the extraordinary scale of the internment campaign, the files reveal its devastating impact well beyond the camps â€” deep into the communities and families of Xinjiang.
The spreadsheets show that the government has primarily targeted middle-age men, most often the heads of the households and main wage-earners.
Beijingâ€™s occasional tours of its so-called model camps often feature attractive young women.
In reality, people between 30 and 59 were especially likely to be interned, according to the spreadsheets.
The policyâ€™s socioeconomic fallout is dire â€” and local governments are keeping a meticulous record of it.
One spreadsheet from 2017 for one town in Yarkand County, which listed households with low incomes that might qualify for welfare, included a young family with five children between the ages of three and 14.
The father had been imprisoned, the mother placed in a re-education camp and the children, in effect, orphaned.
In another, hardly unusual, case, a householdâ€™s two working-age parents were detained, leaving elderly grandparents â€” including a grandmother described as â€œseriously illâ€ â€” to care for two toddlers.
In a column with the header â€œreason for poverty,â€ the relevant spreadsheet offers this explanation: â€œlacks labor force and finances.â€ The toddlersâ€™ father isnâ€™t scheduled to be released until 2030.
Another spreadsheet from September 2018 shows lists of loan defaulters in Pilal Township, Akto County.
In 80 percent of the cases where the reason for default was listed as â€œinternment,â€ most of the borrowed funds were shown to still be in the bank.
A particularly depressing example comes from a village in Yarkand County.
A Uighur farmer and head of a family of five was interned in 2017.
In October 2016, he had received a loan of 40,000 renminbi (nearly $5,700) to purchase agricultural machinery.
The equipment went unused during his detention â€” no other family member knew how to operate it â€” and the loan could not be repaid as scheduled.
The government directed the family to rent out the equipment and send its oldest child, a son, to work.
The family was then officially marked as having been â€œpoverty-alleviated by benefiting from policies.â€ In June 2018, after his release, the farmer applied for financial assistance so he could repay the loan and related interest.
In January 2019, he started to work in the Yarkand County textile industrial park, earning just 800 RMB (about $113) a month.
By then, the son, age 20, had somehow become disabled and was listed on government forms as unable to work.
Thanks to these new document disclosures, we now have hard evidence â€” and the governmentâ€™s own evidence â€” that in addition to implementing a vast internment program in Xinjiang, the Chinese Communist Party is deliberately breaking up families and forcing them into poverty and a form of indentured labor.
For all its efforts at secrecy, the Chinese government can no longer hide the extent, and the reach, of its campaign of repression in Xinjiang.
Some important elements are still unknown.
The total internment figure remains a well-guarded secret.
(Based on the new evidence, I have revised my own estimate: I think that between 900,000 and 1.8 million people have been detained in Xinjiang since the spring of 2017.)
Also missing from the official documents that have surfaced so far are precise records of how the detainees are treated and how, exactly, the process of re-education works.
(About those things, however, we have witness accounts.)
The confidential telegram and local files do not mention the use of physical violence â€” but for one notable exception.
The telegram states that people who resist brainwashing must be singled out for â€œassault-style re-education.â€ Yet another sinister understatement, and it suggests that force and torture may, in fact, be widely used.
In a way, though, we already know all that we really need to know.
The documents that have been disclosed these past few weeks reveal the staggering scale of the repression in Xinjiang and its ruinous effects on the regionâ€™s ethnic communities, well beyond the camps themselves.
Consider this: Official statistics show that the combined net population growth rates of Hotan and Kashgar, two of the largest Uighur regions, dropped by about 84 percent between 2015 and 2018.
The Chinese Communist Party set out, it claimed, to â€œtransform through educationâ€ ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.
In fact, it is ripping apart entire communities and subjugating them on a colossal scale.
And this, at the direction of President Xi himself.
Chinaâ€™s New Civil Religion By Ian Johnson Dec. 21, 2019  BEIJING â€” In the northern suburbs of this city is a small temple to a Chinese folk deity, Lord Guan, a famous warrior deified more than a millennium ago.
Renovated five years ago at the governmentâ€™s expense, the temple is used by a group of retirees who run pilgrimages to a holy mountain, schoolchildren who come to learn traditional culture and a Taoist priest who preaches to wealthy urbanites about the traditional values of ancient China.
Perched atop a hillock overlooking the sprawling capital, the temple is a microcosm of a new civil religion taking shape in China â€” an effort by the Chinese Communist Party to satisfy Chinese peopleâ€™s search for moral guidelines by supplementing the largely irrelevant ideology of communism with a curated version of the past.
This new state-guided religiosity is the flip side of the governmentâ€™s harsh policies toward Islam and Christianity.
Officials believe these two global faiths are hard to control because of their foreign ties, and they have used negotiation or force â€” diplomacy with the Vatican, arrests of prominent Protestants, internment camps for Muslims â€” to try to bring these religions to heel.
Yet Beijingâ€™s recent turn to tradition may be even more significant.
Even though Islam and Christianity are world religions, in China they remain minor, with the number of their combined adherents amounting to less than 10 percent of the population.
Most Chinese believe in an amalgam of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and other traditional values and ideas that still resonate deeply.
For this silent majority of hundreds of millions of people, the governmentâ€™s newfound support for things like the temple to Lord Guan is welcome â€” a feeling that the Chinese Communist Party hopes will bolster its legitimacy, especially given the irrelevance today of its founding ideas.
The benefits of its move to embrace the past may seem obvious, but the shift marks a radical departure, not just for a party officially committed to atheism but also from how reformers over the past century have imagined a modern, prosperous China.
From the 19th century onward, Chinaâ€™s elites argued that the countryâ€™s traditions and faiths were a major reason for its decline.
Reformers in 1898 called for temples to be converted into schools.
While the Nationalist Party under Chiang Kai-shek approved of four religions â€” Buddhism, Taoism (sometimes called â€œDaoismâ€), Christianity and Islam â€” it largely considered traditional Chinese beliefs to be superstitions and advocated the destruction of temples.
Scholars estimate that by the middle of the 20th century, half of the temples that existed in China at the end of the 19th century had been destroyed.
An 1851 survey of the old city of Beijing listed 866 temples; today, I count just 18.
At the end of the 19th century, most villages had at least one temple and many had half a dozen; vast sections of the Chinese countryside now have no temples at all.
When the Communists took power in 1949, they, like the Nationalists, officially recognized four religions â€” but then promptly began persecuting them.
Traditional faiths came under especially harsh treatment, with the government banning bedrock traditional practices, from worshiping ancestors and local deities to following the advice of geomancy masters and spirit mediums.
The three decades of reform that started in the late 1970s loosened controls over society, allowing the revival of all religions and many traditions that had been proscribed.
Despite periodic crackdowns, churches and mosques, but also temples, were rebuilt, and clergy trained.
Although all faiths were supposed to remain under party control, religious feeling boomed, with the number of believers in China topping 500 million by 2010.
Xi Jinpingâ€™s rise to power in late 2012 marks a new era, the third, in the history of the Chinese Communist Partyâ€™s religious policies.
Instead of the destruction of the Mao years and the relatively laissez-faire approach of the reform period, the state has embarked on a form of highly curated revivalism.
One part of its approach rests on a deep suspicion of Christianity and Islam.
The partyâ€™s policy toward Islam has been the most draconian.
Some believers, especially Uighurs in the northwestern province of Xinjiang, have been subjected to a policy of forced secularization.
This has included sending hundreds of thousands of Muslims to re-education camps, compelling restaurants to serve pork and alcohol, and forbidding fasting during Ramadan.
The policy toward Christianity is more nuanced.
Last year, Beijing struck a deal with the Vatican to jointly appoint Catholic bishops.
The Vatican seemed to hope to reverse the decline in the number of Catholics in China.
But for Beijing, the measure was a way to tighten control over the Catholic clergy â€” and, by extension, the church itself.
Protestantism poses an especially vexing problem for the party.
It is arguably Chinaâ€™s fastest-growing religion, with an estimated 60 million or more adherents today (compared with one million in 1949), including some 20 to 30 million who are thought to worship in unregistered (or underground) Protestant churches.
But the faith lacks a unifying structure that would allow for negotiations.
And so the government has fired a few shots across the bow, closing several of the countryâ€™s best-known underground churches.
In many ways, however, the Xi administrationâ€™s embrace of traditional faiths is more radical.
Since taking office, the president has met with Buddhist leaders, and his government has allowed Taoism to flourish.
The state recently issued a landmark plan to improve social mores, the first such program since 2001.
The plan stems from a widespread feeling that Chinaâ€™s relentless drive to get ahead economically has created a spiritual vacuum, and sometimes justifies breaking rules and trampling civility.
Many people do not trust one another.
The governmentâ€™s blueprint for handling this moral crisis calls for endorsing certain traditional beliefs.
The epic paper â€” it runs to 10,000 Chinese characters, and would be significantly longer translated into English â€” doesnâ€™t mention Communist Chinaâ€™s founding father, Mao Zedong, or his successors and their ideologies, focusing instead on Mr. Xi and his efforts to fix social problems like â€œmoney worship and hedonism.â€ It does invoke Communist slogans such as â€œcore socialist values,â€ but in contrast to the previous such document from 2001 â€” which made only passing reference to Chinese traditions â€” it calls the past a â€œrich source of morality.â€ The plan orders party officials to promote â€œancient and worthy sages,â€ as well as to â€œdeeply expoundâ€ traditional concepts such as â€œrenâ€™aiâ€ (benevolence), â€œzhengyiâ€ (righteousness) and â€œjianyi zhengweiâ€ (standing up bravely for the truth).
This effort is not an attempt to replace Communism with Confucianism.
Yet it is fair to say that for the first time since Chinaâ€™s imperial order collapsed in 1911, a central government is embracing the ideas that made up the political-religious order that ran China for much of the past 2,500 years.
Why?
Not only to address Chinaâ€™s moral vacuum, but also as a populist measure.
The country is entering a more uncertain era, of slower growth and rising inequality, and Beijing is draping itself in the mantle of tradition to broaden its appeal.
In doing so, the government seems to be assuming that traditional Chinese values and beliefs are easier to control than foreign religions, and that supporting them will outweigh the costs of suppressing Islam and Christianity.
But I have my doubts.
During a visit this fall to the Lord Guan temple, I saw a dozen or so people, mostly in their 30s and 40s, reading works by Wang Yangming, a philosopher born in the late 15th century.
On the face of it, this was in line with government policy: The party has embraced Wang for exemplifying an incorruptible spirit and matching words with deeds.
But after reading a passage of Wangâ€™s work, the men and women sat around a big wooden table, wielding brushes to write out, over and over again, his most famous phrase: â€œzhi xing he yiâ€ (knowledge and action are one).
This knowledge, according to Wang, comes from an inner light, a conscience â€” one that no government, no matter how powerful, can control.
China, Where State Pomp Comes With Real Feeling By Ian Johnson Oct. 3, 2019  BEIJING â€” Attending Chinaâ€™s National Day celebrations over the years has been a bit like listening to different takes of a song, with the composer honing the themes and jettisoning the raw bits until the piece sounds just right.
Thatâ€™s how I felt at Tuesdayâ€™s celebrations on Tiananmen Square, held to observe the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.
Iâ€™ve attended two other ceremonies like this before â€” for the 35th anniversary in 1984 and the 50th in 1999 â€” and I knew the basic drill: There would be a big military parade followed by floats celebrating the governmentâ€™s accomplishments.
But this show felt bigger and brassier than either of those, as if the composer had decided to use every instrument in the orchestra and cast subtlety aside.
It was slick and sleek, but also overpowering and at times bombastic.
When I received my invitation, government officials told me that I was lucky to attend because it was such a great honor.
I nodded politely but only really understood what they meant when I arrived at Tiananmen Square on Tuesday at 6 a.m. We media types were just a few hundred in a sea of loyal members of the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.
), and for many of them it must have felt like one of the biggest events of their lives.
It would be easy to write these people off as extras.
And 20 years ago, the last time I was at such an event, the people in attendance were mainly highly trained performers who held aloft placards that spelled out different messages, North Koreaâ€“style.
But Tuesdayâ€™s crowd was different.
It was made up of university professors, scientists, administrators, bureaucrats and people who had made some sort of contribution to the state.
They werenâ€™t props but excited participants who expected to remember this day.
I noticed that right away when I walked past a raised platform covered with artificial grass that surrounded a big television screen.
People were crouching down next to the platform and neatly arranging their letter of invitation, parade-picture ID and program, almost all in the same fashion, like sacraments on a church altar.
Then they would snap a picture, aiming their cameras so that Chinaâ€™s national symbol, the Gate of Heavenly Peace, appeared in the background.
These were photos designed to be boasted about on social media: â€œGuess where I was today?â€ â€œYes, at Tiananmen Square.â€ â€œYes, at the ceremony.â€ And here is proof.
If these were their sacraments and this ceremony was their ritual, what then was their belief?
That would probably be the message broadcast on the giant screens that surrounded us.
Before the parade began, those screens showed archival footage of the past 70 years presenting a story about how China had been poor and beaten down by outside powers until the Communist Party saved the country.
The Mao era wasnâ€™t portrayed as foreign journalists and academics often depict it â€” a series of violent campaigns against imagined enemies of the state and the worst famine in recorded history â€” but as a period of pioneering glory, when China secured its borders for the first time in a century, built a heavy industrial base and set the stage for its economic takeoff.
Raised on this ideology, the attendees seemed visibly moved when soldiers carrying the national flag goose-stepped from the Monument to the Peopleâ€™s Heroes at the center of the square down to the enormous flagpole.
I was unnerved by the background barrage of artillery and the amplified sound of the boots striking the pavement â€” it felt like an invasion of giants â€” but many people around me stood solemnly.
This wasnâ€™t stage-managed: Some looked bored, others gazed around, kids played.
But many more looked earnest, just like Americans do when they stand up, hand on heart, for the national anthem at a sports event.
And I donâ€™t think it was just for show that people jumped out of their seats at one of the early high points of the ceremony: when President Xi Jinping appeared standing in an open-top limousine driving out of the Gate of Heavenly Peace.
The moment was pure theater, with Mr. Xi in a dark traditional suit appearing, framed by the vermilion walls of the imperial Forbidden City, as he set off to inspect the troops.
People also oohed and aahed at another signature moment that owed much to Peking Opera.
When Mr. Xi passed the soldiers, their heads swiveled as if on sockets, their eyes bulging as they followed the nationâ€™s most important person.
It was a show of the armed forcesâ€™ unswerving allegiance to the C.C.P.â€™s leader, and the audience needed no encouragement to cheer.
Realizing that some of these emotions are genuine is important because we canâ€™t understand China if we think the party only rules through the authoritarian methods that reporters understandably focus on.
On my social media feed, which includes disgruntled intellectuals but also working-class practitioners of folk religion, itâ€™s clear that many buy into the national story created by the C.C.P.
Inventing traditions is nothing new, nor unique to China.
But here these constructs can sometimes feel uneasy because many of them are imported â€” from soldiersâ€™ dress uniforms that seem decades out of date (gold braids, enormous epaulets, rows of medals) to soundtrack-like music worthy of John Williams (fanfares, kettle drums, plenty of brass).
I might be nostalgic, but the mood 35 years ago felt a bit different.
I was a student then, and a group of us was bussed down to Tiananmen Square for the ceremony.
We then milled around for most of the day.
There was also an orchestrated event, but security was minimal and you could still stand right next to the performers as they marched or danced past.
Some students even jumped into the parade and held up a banner greeting the paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
China today is more serious about being a superpower.
When the spontaneous enthusiasm flagged on Tuesday, cheerleaders made sure the flags kept waving.
And security was so tight that it bordered on paranoia: Neighborhood parks around town implemented airport-style security to even enter.
But that, too, was part of the spectacle, the message and the vision â€” of a focused and disciplined state, led by the Chinese Communist Party, that can put on a spectacle few countries can match.
Coronavirus and the Panic Epidemic By Ian Johnson Jan. 30, 2020  BEIJING â€” The absurdity of the situation hit me on Wednesday when I was coming home from a local bar at 8 p.m.
I had ridden my bike a few hours earlier to a park for a walk and then to meet a friend â€” my first human contact in five days, excluding the cashier at the grocery store.
But the side gate Iâ€™d used to leave the enormous Communist-era compound was now chained shut.
What?
A notice in Chinese said it was locked to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
So I headed toward the north entrance.
That one is for pedestrians and has two barriers set slightly apart, just wide enough to get through on foot.
Thatâ€™s O.K., I thought, I can squeeze by with my bike and be home in a few minutes.
I rode around the block, but when I got to the gate I had to slam on the brakes.
Someone had taken a dozen ride-share bikes, lashed them together with wire and piled them in between the barriers.
Then, for good measure, theyâ€™d fastened the heap to the posts with more wire, making it into some sort of postmodern commentary on our hypermobile society.
Laughing, I rode on to the main entrance.
It has a car entrance with a big gate and on either side, walkways for pedestrians.
One of those was also piled high with ride-share bikes sacrificed for the national good; the other was protected by two security guards Iâ€™d never seen before.
They blocked my way.
â€œWhat do you want?â€ one of them asked.
â€œTo go home.
I live here.â€  â€œHave you been to Wuhan recently?â€  â€œI just rode back.
Iâ€™m exhausted!â€  The humor was beyond their pay grade.
â€œIs anyone in your home from Wuhan or has been there recently?â€  I needed to stop fooling around.
â€œNo, I havenâ€™t been there in four years.
I live alone.
No fever.
I feel fine.â€  They silently let me through.
This felt like the height of foolishness: Why would the gates be open during the day but locked down at night?
Do viruses operate like vampires?
Thatâ€™s when I realized the guardsâ€™ effort was just part of a Borg-like lockdown that the state had put into place with the alacrity of officials in full C.Y.A.
mode.
The next day I was cleaning my apartment: No one could enter Beijing anymore, so my one luxury, an hour-a-week house cleaner, was stuck in her village even though the main phase of the Lunar New Year holiday was over.
There was a knock on my door.
It was the good people from the apartment management office, Mrs. Luo and her assistant.
â€œOh, Mr. Zhang, nice to see you,â€ Mrs. Luo, the henna-haired manager of lease renewals, said, addressing me by my Chinese name.
â€œIs there anyone from Wuhan in your apartment?â€  â€œNo.
Still not.â€  â€œO.K.
Take a look at this please.â€  She handed me a sheet from the local Communist Party district committee, listing dos and donâ€™ts to follow during the outbreak.
Do seek help.
Do listen to the local government.
Do keep warm.
Do stay at home.
Do avoid contact.
Do wash your hands.
Donâ€™t spit.
Donâ€™t exert yourself too much.
Donâ€™t associate with people whoâ€™ve recently arrived from the infected area around the megacity of Wuhan.
On the back was a list of all the Communist Party street committees and their phone numbers.
Finally, after five years of living in this neighborhood and countless failed efforts to register my complaints about illegal construction at night, I had some phone numbers.
I filed the sheet for future use.
The German language has, as usual, a hyper-specific word for this phenomenon: â€œAktionismus,â€ literally Actionism, or action for actionâ€™s sake.
What I was witnessing was Aktionismus in the face of a problem that required a sensitive response involving public trust.
But since the Chinese government cannot elicit either of those things, I was seeing the compensatory flailing-around of a state with no other options.
Instead of having an adult conversation with the population about the virus and putting in place reasonable policies that have been used effectively elsewhere, the Chinese state has gone into full lockdown mode.
This demonstrates one of those truisms from political science: Authoritarian governments are like people who donâ€™t have any fingers but do possess two thumbs.
They can take forceful actions but canâ€™t fine-tune the levers of government.
Actually, Iâ€™m not being fair.
When the Chinese Communist Party has time, it can come up with and use sophisticated policies â€” witness its co-opting of traditional faiths to fill a spiritual vacuum in society.
But when faced with a crisis, the party canâ€™t seem to avoid grand gestures: building hospitals from scratch in two weeks, locking down tens of millions of people, banning millions more from traveling to big cities and so on.
In some ways, a moment like this one is a technocratâ€™s dream: When Western health care experts say that this sort of lockdown wonâ€™t work, they basically mean itâ€™s never been tried on this scale with this kind of uberefficient government.
Now that itâ€™s being tried, not just in Beijing but also across the country, the effects are kind of thrilling to watch.
Apartment compounds like mine are being fumigated.
(With what?
Who cares!)
People are walking around with loudspeakers blaring out warnings against the virus.
Villages are closing their gates as if bandits were on the prowl.
And going to a restaurant or a bar is almost an act of treason or, at best, foolish selfishness.
The most interesting question is why the party feels the need to carry on like this.
I think it knows the people donâ€™t trust it in these cases and assume there has been a cover-up.
Hence one of the most popular figures in the crisis: Zhong Nanshan, the hero of the 2002-3 SARS outbreak, now 83, who is back in action, treating patients and warning citizens about the need for hygiene.
He has been adopted as the incorruptible official â€” a familiar trope in Chinese history, the Confucian official who stands tall despite pressures to bend.
And so we read endless profiles of Dr. Zhong in Chinese social media, discussing his family background, upbringing, successes and apolitical pursuit of science-based truth.
The clear implication is that he is that rare official capable of such principled conduct.
Behind all this lies the feeling that most other people in the party canâ€™t quite be trusted.
This has been reinforced over the past few days by reports that at least eight people who were detained in Wuhan in early January on charges of spreading rumors are in fact medical doctors, not fear-mongering neâ€™er-do-wells.
This startling fact is now leaking out in online reports that are sometimes, but not always, being blocked.
At some point, the government will have to admit to a partial cover-up.
Considering the underlying distrust, itâ€™s hard for the government to say what many epidemiologists are saying: This outbreak is serious but not catastrophic.
Because if the state leveled with the people, it would also have to admit that there is no need for this degree of social control.
Some 259 people were reported to have died as of Saturday evening, in a country of nearly 1.4 billion, and there is no indication that we are at the start of a Hollywood disaster-style movie.
The governmentâ€™s inability to formulate a measured response will turn this outbreak into a direct successor of the SARS epidemic.
That hardly was a huge public health disaster â€” fewer than 800 deaths â€” yet it has taken on a legendary reputation as a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, one that should never be allowed to recur.
But of course a new outbreak has occurred.
Does this mean that the state will suffer?
I donâ€™t think so.
For despite their mistrust of the system, people over all are going along with the lockdown.
In private conversations and on chat rooms, they say itâ€™s impossible not to take drastic action in a country as big as China.
In this sense, the population has absorbed the governmentâ€™s narrative of Chinese exceptionalism: Running China requires a strong hand, and these measures, as absurd as they seem, are proof that the government is doing a good job â€” and portend that the party will come out of this, as always, triumphant.
Coronavirus Spreads, and the World Pays for Chinaâ€™s Dictatorship By Nicholas Kristof Jan. 29, 2020  Chinaâ€™s leaders sometimes seem 10 feet tall, presiding over a political and economic juggernaut that has founded universities at a rate of one a week and that recently used more cement in three years than the United States did in the entire 20th century.
President Trump has hailed Chinaâ€™s president, Xi Jinping, as a â€œbrilliant leader,â€ and Michael Bloomberg says Xi is â€œnot a dictator.â€ But weâ€™re now seeing the dangers of Xiâ€™s authoritarian model, for China and the world.
The first known coronavirus infection in the city of Wuhan presented symptoms beginning on Dec. 1, and by late December there was alarm in Wuhanâ€™s medical circles.
That would have been the moment for the authorities to act decisively.
And act decisively they did â€” not against the virus, but against whistle-blowers who were trying to call attention to the public health threat.
A doctor who told a WeChat group about the virus was disciplined by the Communist Party and forced to admit wrongdoing.
The police reported giving â€œeducationâ€ and â€œcriticismâ€ to eight front-line doctors for â€œrumormongeringâ€ about the epidemic; instead of punishing these doctors, Xi should have listened to them.
China informed the World Health Organization of the virus on Dec. 31 but kept its own citizens in the dark; as other countries reported infections even as China pretended that it had confined the outbreak to Wuhan, Chinese joked grimly about a â€œpatrioticâ€ virus that only struck foreigners.
Wuhanâ€™s mayor said he wasnâ€™t authorized to discuss the virus until late this month.
In that time, people traveled to and from Wuhan and didnâ€™t take precautions.
The government finally ordered a lockdown on Jan. 23 that effectively quarantined people in Wuhan.
But by then, according to the mayor, five million people had already fled the city.
Partly because the government covered up the epidemic in the early stages, hospitals were not able to gather supplies, and there are now major shortages of testing kits, masks and protective gear.
Some doctors were reduced to making goggles out of plastic folders.
One reason for the early cover-up is that Xiâ€™s China has systematically gutted institutions like journalism, social media, nongovernmental organizations, the legal profession and others that might provide accountability.
These institutions were never very robust in China, but on and off they were tolerated until Xi came along.
I conducted a series of experiments on Chinese blogs over the years beginning in 2003 and was sometimes surprised by what I could get away with â€” but no longer.
Xi has dragged China backward in terms of civil society, crushing almost every wisp of freedom and oversight.
For the same reason that Xiâ€™s increasingly authoritarian China bungled the coronavirus outbreak, it also mishandled a swine fever virus that since 2018 has devastated Chinaâ€™s hog industry and killed almost one-quarter of the worldâ€™s pigs.
Dictators often make poor decisions because they donâ€™t get accurate information: When you squelch independent voices you end up getting just flattery and optimism from those around you.
Senior Chinese officials have told me that they are routinely lied to on trips to meet local officials and must dispatch their drivers and secretaries to assess the truth and gauge the real mood.
For this or other reasons, Xi has made a series of mistakes.
He mishandled and inflamed the political crisis in Hong Kong, he inadvertently assured the re-election of his nemesis as president of Taiwan, and he has presided over worsening relations with the United States and many other countries.
The coronavirus has already reached the Xinjiang region in the Far West of China, and one risk is that it will spread in the internment camps where China is confining about one million Muslims with poor sanitation and limited health care.
Viruses are challenges for any country, and itâ€™s only fair to note that China does a better job protecting its people from measles than the U.S. does.
Itâ€™s a credit to Chinaâ€™s system that a baby born in Beijing today has a longer life expectancy than a baby born in Washington, D.C. More broadly, the United States, which has several impoverished counties with lower life expectancy than Cambodia or Bangladesh, is in no position to lecture anyone about health.
But, with a dose of humility, letâ€™s get over any misplaced admiration some Americans have for Xiâ€™s authoritarian model.
The Chinese social contract has been that citizens will not get ballots but will live steadily better lives, yet Chinaâ€™s economy is now as weak as it has been in three decades â€” and the coronavirus will sap growth further.
Xi is not living up to his end of the bargain, and this is seen in the anger emerging on Chinese social media despite the best efforts of censors.
I donâ€™t know if Xi is in political trouble for his misrule, but he should be.
Heâ€™s a preening dictator, and with this outbreak some citizens are paying a price.
Cuomoâ€™s Bad Medicine on Medicaid By The Editorial Board Jan. 31, 2020  For years, New York State has operated one of the most generous Medicaid programs in the country, a point of pride in a state with a long tradition of investing in the social safety net.
The program provides health care and other services to more than six million people, largely low-income New Yorkers, and the costs are shared between the state and federal government.
But profligate spending has sent costs spiraling in recent years.
The Medicaid program has become a driving force behind a $6.1 billion hole in New Yorkâ€™s budget next year, and a brewing political battle over what to do about it.
Though Medicaid costs are rising across the United States, in New York â€” among the countryâ€™s largest programs, and long one of its most expensive â€” spending has surged.
From 2015 to 2019, annual spending grew by an average of 6 percent, according to a report last year by the Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative nonprofit research organization.
Thatâ€™s roughly double the rate of growth in the previous several years, even as enrollment remained flat.
Health care and budget experts have said a variety of factors are behind the trend, including an increase in demand for personal care programs that provide nonmedical services to disabled New Yorkers, a minimum-wage increase and financial assistance that the state has provided to struggling hospitals.
New Yorkâ€™s share of its $75 billion annual Medicaid bill is now about $30 billion and growing, imposing an increasingly untenable burden on state and local budgets.
The federal government pays the rest.
The good news is that Gov.
Andrew Cuomo, who is in charge of administering the federal program, has moved to rein in costs.
The bad news is that he has said localities will have to pay for increases in local Medicaid spending above 3 percent.
Thatâ€™s unfair and unrealistic.
Local governments in New York already pay more mandated Medicaid costs than local governments in any other state, a dynamic thatâ€™s been in place since the program began in the 1960s.
Thatâ€™s not unusual in New York, where Albany relies on New York Cityâ€™s tax base to fund the bulk of state services from education to commuter rails.
In 2018, local governments in New York sent $7.6 billion to Albany for the program, according to a 2018 report from the Citizens Budget Commission.
In Fulton County in upstate New York, for instance, the local Medicaid bill for 2016 amounted to more than 15 percent of the county budget.
In New York City, the annual Medicaid tab is roughly $5 billion, or nearly 5 percent of the cityâ€™s budget.
If the spending increases continue, and the state forces local governments to pay for them, the de Blasio administration estimates the city would owe an additional $1.1 billion next year.
The state says the figure would be much lower.
Mr. Cuomo has called on local governments to reduce costs.
Thatâ€™s fine: New York City and counties across the state, which oversee enrollment, should work to root out any fraud or abuse and ensure that those who sign up for the program are eligible and truly in need.
â€œThey are the on-the-ground administrator.
We respond to them,â€ Mr. Cuomo said in a phone call Wednesday.
Really though, local governments have limited say over how the program is run.
Most of that responsibility rests with the state.
When it comes to reducing Medicaid costs, thatâ€™s where the focus should remain.
The most promising effort so far is Mr. Cuomoâ€™s Medicaid Redesign Team, a working group assigned to find $2.5 billion in savings this year, preserving benefits while slashing waste.
The governor used a similar task force to successfully carry out cost-saving Medicaid reforms nearly a decade ago, aided by the Affordable Care Act.
The new group will be led by the same two men: Michael Dowling, the president and C.E.O.
of Northwell Health, and by Dennis Rivera, the former head of 1199 S.E.I.U., the powerhouse health care union.
They are set to make their recommendations ahead of the April 1 budget deadline.
It will be up to Mr. Cuomo to ensure the public good is top of mind.
The redesign group should issue a thorough report, presenting its findings to the public and the Legislature.
Right now, itâ€™s not clear they plan to do so, and thatâ€™s a problem.
While not perfect, the approach is far better than simply forking over more and more taxpayer dollars and sticking local governments with an ever-growing tab, as the state has been doing.
To get New Yorkâ€™s Medicaid program back on track, the group will need to take a hard look at spending on nonmedical services like cooking and bathing for homebound New Yorkers.
According to the Empire Center, New Yorkâ€™s Medicaid spending on such personal services was the highest in the country.
That may be because of a program that has expanded in recent years in which Medicaid pays nonmedical providers like family members to care for clients.
In 2016, personal spending in New York accounted for 40 percent of national Medicaid spending for the category overall, up from 23 percent in 2011, the Empire Center said.
Complicating matters is a political dynamic friendly to the health care industry.
In 2018, for example, the Greater New York Hospital Association gave more than $1 million in political contributions to the stateâ€™s Democratic Party.
Not long afterward, the state increased Medicaid reimbursement rates for the first time since 2008, costing the state an estimated $140 million per year.
Mr. Cuomo has denied that donations influence his policy decisions, and Cuomo administration officials said at the time that the increase was necessary, and simply long overdue.
Health care experts disagree, and say hospital revenue had already been on the rise.
New Yorkâ€™s Medicaid bill is out of control.
The first order of business is to understand more about why, and to be honest with the public about what needs to be done about it.
Democratsâ€™ Baffling 2020 Mess By Frank Bruni Dec. 7, 2019  Kamala Harris folded her tent, and on that patch of ground, many flimsy theories bloomed.
Disappointed Democrats groused that you obviously had to be rich to compete in the 2020 race â€” because she was gone, while two billionaires remained â€” and pointed to the potentially all-white, un-diverse lineup at the partyâ€™s next debate as proof that the qualifying criteria put too much of a premium on fund-raising.
But Harris had made the cut for that debate.
And she entered the presidential sweepstakes with a higher net worth ($6 million, according to Forbes) than Bernie Sanders ($2.5 million), Amy Klobuchar ($2 million) or Pete Buttigieg ($100,000), who are still in the hunt and are among the six contenders slated to be sparring onstage on Dec. 19.
Whatâ€™s more, Sanders and another of the six, Elizabeth Warren, have raised buckets of money without courting plutocrats.
Many Democrats blamed the media for Harrisâ€™s demise.
They have a point, inasmuch as some news organizations never had the kind of romance with her that they did with Buttigieg and Beto Oâ€™Rourke, two white men.
I noted as much in a column last May, pointing to Oâ€™Rourkeâ€™s placement on the cover of Vanity Fair and Buttigiegâ€™s on the cover of Time.
But the media fell quickly out of love with Oâ€™Rourke and is picking Buttigieg apart for his lack of support among African-Americans and his past employment as a McKinsey consultant.
And Harris was hardly ignored: Her initial campaign rally in Oakland, Calif., in January was covered live, in its entirety, on MSNBC and CNN.
That same month, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC told her, in a face-to-face interview, â€œI think there is a good chance that you are going to win the nomination.â€ And after the Democratic debate in June, when Harris stirringly confronted Joe Biden about his past opposition to federally mandated busing to integrate schools, she received a bonanza of media attention and rapturous reviews.
I get that this Democratic primary isnâ€™t playing out as anyone predicted or in remote accordance with the partyâ€™s image of itself and with its priorities.
None of the top four candidates â€” Biden, Warren, Buttigieg and Sanders â€” is a person of color, three of them are 70 or older, and the billionaires, Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg, are dipping into their personal fortunes in their efforts to gain ground.
For a party that celebrates diversity, pitches itself to underdogs and prides itself on being future-minded and youth-oriented, thatâ€™s a freaky, baffling turn of events.
But some of the conclusions being drawn and complaints being raised donâ€™t fully hold water.
Take the fears about the nomination being purchased.
Without question, running for office is too expensive.
That dynamic can definitely favor candidates with lucrative connections.
And candidates are forced â€” unless theyâ€™re Steyer or Bloomberg â€” to devote ludicrous and possibly corrupting sums of time to political panhandling.
But at least at present, neither Steyer nor Bloomberg is exactly barreling toward victory.
And while Cory Booker drew a connection between Harrisâ€™s departure and a process warped by wealth, the link is tenuous.
Booker, whose campaign presses on despite his failure to qualify for the December debate, said of Harrisâ€™s withdrawal, â€œVoters did not determine her destiny.â€  Actually, they kind of did.
Theyâ€™re the ones who are or arenâ€™t excited enough about a candidacy to donate money and keep it alive.
Theyâ€™re the ones responding to pollsters and, by flagging their preferences, determining which candidates take on the air of plausibility that often generates the next round of donations.
I keep seeing, on Twitter and Facebook, laments about Harrisâ€™s fate from Democrats who chose to support candidates other than her.
Well, she couldnâ€™t succeed on generalized, ambient good will.
I also keep seeing and hearing statements along the lines that the party should be ashamed of the way things are turning out, that the party failed.
While an official party entity, the Democratic National Committee, indeed set criteria for the debates â€” which had to have some criteria â€” thereâ€™s otherwise no committee of elders or secret cabal that decrees which candidates prosper and which donâ€™t.
Besides which, as Eric Levitz observed in New York magazine, Harris â€œboasted the enthusiastic support of Hillaryâ€™s donor network and supporters, warm relations with Obamaworld, and the sympathies of a broad range of Democratic lawmakers in the nationâ€™s largest state and beyond.â€ Levitz added that when Harris ended her campaign on Tuesday, she trailed only Biden in the website FiveThirtyEightâ€™s tally of important endorsements; that Booker has more such endorsements than Sanders, who is far ahead of him; and that Klobuchar has more than Buttigieg, whom she distantly trails.
So if the party is fellow Democratic politicians of note, itâ€™s hardly driving the direction of this contest.
We in the media arenâ€™t driving it, either, though thereâ€™s constant carping along those lines.
Weâ€™ve always been fundamentally responsive, bestowing coverage based on established interest, and weâ€™re more responsive than ever in this digitized age of sophisticated, real-time measures of precisely what our audience does and doesnâ€™t turn to.
We give you a tide of Warren in part because you thrilled to the earlier trickle.
We serve you oodles of Buttigieg because weâ€™ve noticed your appetite for it.
Another questionable assessment of this primary is that â€œelectabilityâ€ is crowding out candidates who donâ€™t fit some safe profile.
Yes, many Democratic voters tell pollsters that choosing the candidate most likely to beat Trump is their top concern.
Yes, thereâ€™s evidence that such an impulse is leading some voters away from candidates of color.
But if â€œelectabilityâ€ emphatically ruled the day, wouldnâ€™t at least one of the three current or former governors already gone from the race â€” John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Steve Bullock of Montana and Jay Inslee of Washington â€” have fared better?
Governors are frequently touted as the best candidates, and they account for four of the past seven presidents.
If â€œelectabilityâ€ ruled the day, would Bidenâ€™s stiffest competition be coming from a 78-year-old democratic socialist who recently had a heart attack (and just placed first in a California poll), a 70-year-old former Ivy League law professor whom Trump delights in calling â€œPocahontasâ€ and the 37-year-old gay mayor of a small Indiana city?
Thereâ€™s a lot to this primary thatâ€™s more complicated than meets the eye, a lot that explodes assumptions.
According to the polling so far, voters arenâ€™t drawn to candidates whose demographic profiles overlap with theirs.
Bidenâ€™s support from black Democrats in a national Quinnipiac poll late last month was more than eight times what Harrisâ€™s or Bookerâ€™s was.
He and Sanders do exponentially better among Latinos than JuliÃ¡n Castro does.
Sanders, not Buttigieg, has the advantage among Democrats under the age of 35.
And many gay Democrats have rejected Buttigieg as inadequately progressive and even insufficiently gay.
So if identity group, electability, media bias and personal wealth arenâ€™t the secrets to success, what are?
I think weâ€™re learning yet again that thereâ€™s no tidy, trusty formula.
But broad name recognition among engaged voters â€” which Biden, Sanders and, to a lesser extent, Warren all had at the outset â€” is an enormous asset.
So are a sales pitch and brand, like Buttigiegâ€™s, that are distinct from any other contenderâ€™s.
Finally, thereâ€™s political acumen.
Thereâ€™s raw talent.
The last Democratic president, Barack Obama, had plenty of it.
The next Democratic president will, too.
Devin Nunes Is Danielle Steel By Frank Bruni Nov. 15, 2019  I came to your house with a gun.
At least imagine I did.
I tied you to a chair, took a step back and repeatedly fired.
But my arm twitched; every bullet missed.
Meanwhile, you slipped your knots and fled.
By the reasoning of Representative Jim Jordan, I did absolutely nothing wrong.
Youâ€™re alive!
Not a drop of blood on you!
An unconsummated crime is no crime at all, or so Jordan, one of the Republican Partyâ€™s more rococo philosophers, argued on Wednesday in defense of President Trump.
Ukraine got its military aid; Trump did not get his investigation of the Bidens.
To Jordan, thatâ€™s proof of innocence.
To a normal person, thatâ€™s proof of incompetence, which doesnâ€™t exonerate the president but should definitely reassure us.
Trumpâ€™s an autocrat all right, but the silver lining is that heâ€™s an inept one.
All strongmen should be this weak.
And all of us should have the mental limberness and ethical elasticity that Jordan and his troupe possess.
Theyâ€™re the Cirque du Soleil of câ€™est la vie.
Iâ€™ve never seen anything like the Republican effort to defend Trump, which charts the frontiers of creativity, explores the outer limits of audacity, mutates like the monsters in the â€œAlienâ€ movies and restores my faith in American ingenuity.
My faith in Washington, too.
I long feared that politics had stopped attracting the countryâ€™s top talent, but some of our finest storytellers are working in the United States Capitol.
John Grisham has nothing on Jordan.
Danielle Steel canâ€™t hold a candle to Devin Nunes.
Nunes was among the first Republicans to pipe up on Day 1 of the impeachment inquiryâ€™s public hearings, held by the House Intelligence Committee, and it wasnâ€™t just his narrative ambition that mesmerized me.
It was his bold descent into his thesaurus, a sort of semantic spelunking.
The hearings, he said, marked the â€œpitiful finaleâ€ and â€œspectacular implosionâ€ of the â€œRussia hoax.â€ They amounted to a â€œscorched-earth war against President Trumpâ€ that was â€œhorrifically one-sidedâ€ and â€œpreposterous.â€ This â€œlow-rent Ukrainian sequelâ€ had already involved a â€œclosed-door audition process in a cultlike atmosphere in the basement of the Capitol.â€ Cultlike, no less!
Thatâ€™s a more fitting description of Republicansâ€™ obeisance to the president and laundering of his wrongdoing, but then one hallmark of Trump and his sycophants is the projection of their own flaws onto their adversaries.
Nunesâ€™s best bit on Wednesday and then again on Friday was his portrayal of Trumpâ€™s Democratic detractors as amateur pornographers intent on finding nude pictures of the president.
Iâ€™m fairly confident that no one is intent on finding nude photographs of the president.
But at this point it wouldnâ€™t surprise me if Trump himself tweeted one out.
Would that be any crazier than what he did on Friday, as Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, testified?
There she was, a pained, stoic State Department amalgam of Erin Brockovich and Norma Rae, and Trump used his Twitter account to call her an international wrecking ball, single-handedly responsible for the mess that is Mogadishu.
(One of her posts before Ukraine was Somalia.)
This accomplished nothing in the way of silencing her but raised the prospect of witness intimidation being added to any articles of impeachment.
Clearly, the Republican response to this impeachment inquiry isnâ€™t some elegant strategy.
Itâ€™s an epic snit.
Its leitmotif is hypocrisy.
Nunes opened Fridayâ€™s hearing by lamenting all the important government business that was on hold because Democrats preferred to torture Trump.
I somehow missed his pleas that lawmakers keep their eyes on the ball and devote themselves to practical problem-solving when the president stirred up one culture war after another just to change the topic of a given news cycle or hear a rally audienceâ€™s roar.
But along comes the impeachment inquiry, and suddenly House Republicans are stymied stewards of levelheaded government.
Theyâ€™re dismissing Wednesdayâ€™s and Fridayâ€™s hearings, held in public, as pure theater.
But they complained about the closed-door testimony beforehand.
Theyâ€™re shrugging off the accounts of William Taylor, George Kent and others as hearsay.
But the White House has decreed that such firsthand witnesses as Mick Mulvaney not cooperate.
One moment, Mulvaney publicly acknowledges the shakedown of Ukraineâ€™s president, insists that itâ€™s how foreign policy is done and tells the media to â€œget over it.â€ The next, he tells the media that theyâ€™re reprehensible fabulists for reporting exactly what he said.
One moment, Republicans completely ignore Trumpâ€™s infamous July 25 phone call and claim that thereâ€™s no direct evidence of his bullying and â€” yes, Nancy Pelosi is right â€” his bribery.
The next, they acknowledge the call, sigh over Trumpâ€™s behavior but say that itâ€™s hardly impeachable.
In fairness, thatâ€™s only slightly more confusing to me than the Democratsâ€™ perspective on the call, a definitive piece of evidence that they may be inadvertently downgrading.
Usually, a process like the one that theyâ€™ve been engaged in over the last seven weeks is about finding a smoking gun.
This process began with the smoking gun, and the farther the Democrats travel from it â€” eight witnesses this coming week?
â€” the more they risk implying that it wasnâ€™t enough.
But for curious behavior, Republicans have them easily beat, and their conduct during the impeachment inquiry is the culmination and apotheosis of their conduct since Trump wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination: an utter sellout of principle and a pure embrace of fiction to pacify an emotional infant and keep him from spitting up on them.
During Wednesdayâ€™s hearing, Republicans again suggested â€” while maintaining straight faces â€” that Trumpâ€™s foremost concern was corruption in Ukraine.
Steve Castor, the Republicansâ€™ chief counsel, also gave one of the presidentâ€™s most convenient (and thus favorite) conspiracy theories a fresh whirl, positing that perhaps American intelligence officials had it all wrong and Ukraine, not Russia, hacked Democratic emails in 2016 and otherwise interfered in the election.
How would this make Trumpâ€™s demand that Ukrainians smear Joe Biden in return for millions of dollars of already-authorized aid O.K.?
It wouldnâ€™t â€” but what a juicy distraction!
And what a perfect gateway for Castorâ€™s attempt to get Taylor to testify that Trump legitimately believed that Ukrainians were, in Castorâ€™s words, â€œout to get him.â€  Try to follow along.
Not only does incompetence equal innocence, but also paranoia is exculpatory.
Same goes for the relative dastardliness of a deed, which becomes innocuous if itâ€™s not maximally obnoxious.
Thatâ€™s my takeaway from when Castor, referring to Rudy Giulianiâ€™s shenanigans, asked Taylor: â€œThis irregular channel of diplomacy, itâ€™s not as outlandish as it could be â€” is that correct?â€ Clarence Darrow, move over.
Another genius of jurisprudence demands space in the history books.
All that Wednesdayâ€™s hearing lacked was Lindsey Graham.
Yes, I know, he serves in the Senate, and the hearing took place in the House.
But heâ€™s the standard-bearer for Trump-coddling contortionism, the reigning king of the kinds of contradictions that were on display.
Presaging Jordanâ€™s approach at the hearing, Graham a week and a half ago shrugged off the impeachment inquiry by calling Trumpâ€™s policy toward Ukraine so â€œincoherentâ€ that the president and his minions â€œseem to be incapable of forming a quid pro quo.â€  He said at one point that heâ€™d be open to any evidence that backed up such a quid pro quo, but then, more recently, he announced that he wouldnâ€™t and couldnâ€™t be bothered to follow the testimony, because heâ€™d already made up his mind.
As Billy Binion of Reason magazine noted, â€œGraham has bemoaned the Democratsâ€™ lack of transparency, only to shield his eyes once the curtain was lifted.â€  Maybe Graham will storm the hearing room yet, an effigy of Hunter Biden in tow.
That would match the dignity of what weâ€™ve seen from Republicans so far.
Did I Just Get Yanged?
By Bari Weiss Jan. 30, 2020  It was New Yearâ€™s Eve, and I had decided to spend it with Andrew Yang.
A self-described â€œAsian man whoâ€™s good at math,â€ Mr. Yang had raised an impressive $16.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 for his presidential campaign.
Despite being newly flush, the campaign didnâ€™t hold its shindig in a Napa Valley wine cave or at Gramercy Tavern, but in a florescent-lit room above a bar in Nashua, N.H.
The party looked like nothing so much as a high school dance if you had banned the bullies.
There was a modest buffet of meatballs, spanakopita, Ritz crackers and Cheddar cheese.
The D.J., a boomer with trousers that badly need hemming, could have been your chemistry teacher bouncing to Cardi B.
Now, a few days away from the Iowa caucus, Mr. Yang has outlasted more than a dozen candidates, including three senators and two governors.
He came in first among Democrats in the Iowa Youth Straw Poll on Tuesday.
Next week, heâ€™ll be back on the debate stage.
He remains a very long shot: National polls have him consistently in the second tier, right next to Amy Klobuchar.
Still, conventional wisdom would say that Andrew Yang should be nowhere this close to the American presidency.
I went to New Hampshire because I wanted to understand how a political rookie with what seemed like little going for him beyond a signature proposal of free money and relentlessly cheerful online fans had gotten this far.
What does the URL candidateâ€™s campaign look like IRL?
That night, the Yang Gang, as the candidateâ€™s fans proudly call themselves, was a happy crowd of gamers, Asians, former goth girls, Burning Man enthusiasts, sci-fi geeks, students, coders and stoners.
When Mr. Yang dropped a â€œLord of the Ringsâ€ joke â€” â€œItâ€™s like the Eye of Sauron is closing in!â€ he said of his momentum in the race â€” they erupted in laughter.
Hardcore Yang voters are not cool.
And that is exactly their, and his, appeal.
Among the partygoers on New Yearâ€™s Eve were Jackie and Dave Farrell, former Bernie Sanders supporters who own a deli in Caldwell, N.J. Mr. Farrell wore a handmade knitted beanie stitched with the words â€œYang,â€ â€œMath,â€ â€œVoteâ€ and â€œ2020â€; Ms. Farrell had a pink Yang Gang baseball hat over her blue hair and a copy of the candidateâ€™s best seller, â€œThe War on Normal People,â€ in her purse.
They fell in love inside an online role playing game called HoboWars.
Itâ€™s hard to imagine anyone at a Joe Biden event with that kind of meet-cute.
â€œHe actually sold me a guild,â€ Ms. Farrell told me.
â€œItâ€™s sort of like a gang.
Like a Yang gang.â€  Talk to anyone in the Yang Gang for a few minutes and theyâ€™ll inevitably tell you how they got Yanged.
The story almost always begins with a younger person telling an older person to Google Andrew Yang.
Which is exactly what happened with the Farrells.
In August, a 23-year-old employee in the deli approached Ms. Farrell to ask whom she was supporting.
â€œI was like: â€˜Bernie, I guess.
I supported him in 2016,â€™â€ she recalled.
â€œAnd he goes, â€˜Why havenâ€™t you Googled Andrew Yang yet?â€  So she did.
â€œI literally stayed up till 4 a.m. that night watching videos.â€  Have you ever been the target of a Twitter mob?
Itâ€™s about as pleasant as a Brazilian wax in slow motion.
The one thing that brings a small measure of comfort when you are in the digital cross hairs is the following assertion: The internet is not real life.
It is true, at least for the time being, that a horde of pixels cannot transform itself into a horde of people.
But the lie that there is a bright line between the online world and the â€œrealâ€ one has been well and truly debunked.
Just ask any middle-school girl shamed for an Instagram post, or any adult fired because of a bad tweet, or any Democrat hoping to oust Donald Trump and become the 46th president of the United States.
Bernie Sanders may be fueled by his zealous fans on social media, but of all the Democrats running for president, the web means the most to Andrew Yang.
Without it, his candidacy simply wouldnâ€™t exist.
Itâ€™s a classic underdog story: a political unknown, ignored by the mainstream media, sidestepping the pundits who had considered him a punchline.
â€œIn the early days there werenâ€™t many people in cable news clamoring to have me on their shows,â€ he told me over bubble tea on a recent afternoon in his Manhattan campaign headquarters.
â€œAnd so you seek out people who can reach lots of Americans.â€  Those people were the ones with podcasts.
â€œWhat launched us was Sam Harris,â€ said Mr. Yang of his June 2018 appearance on Mr. Harrisâ€™s show â€œMaking Sense.â€ It put him on the map: â€œI was invited to speak at the Wing Ding in Iowaâ€ â€” a major Democratic fund-raising event â€” â€œbecause one of the people there was a Sam Harris fan.â€  Mr. Harris introduced him to Joe Rogan, a mixed martial arts color commentator who hosts one of the most popular podcasts in the country.
(Disclosure: Iâ€™ve also appeared on his show.)
â€œJoe Rogan was the game changer,â€ Mr. Yang said.
â€œWe raised tens of thousands of dollars a day for awhile there and a million bucks in a week.â€  But it isnâ€™t simply that Mr. Yang cleverly used new platforms to his advantage.
Sure, the podcasts gave him a big boost, but lots of politicians have used new media to expand their reach: Franklin Roosevelt commandeered the radio; Team Obama mastered the email blast; President Trump tears up Twitter.
Mr. Yangâ€™s outsize success shows that the people who insist that Rachel Maddow has more influence over the American electorate than Mr. Rogan are lying to themselves about where cultural power in America is actually located.
What Mr. Yang understands is that the old rules no longer apply â€” and that flouting those rules is an energizing strategy.
But while Donald Trump burned the whole house down, Andrew Yang is dunking on the system with a big smile.
Thatâ€™s how he gets onstage at a Democratic debate, points out the ridiculousness of the artifice â€” â€œWeâ€™re up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing roles in this reality TV showâ€ â€” and walks away with one of the most talked-about moments of the night despite having had the least talking time.
His appeal is a powerful reminder that the animating political conflict of our era may not be left versus right, but establishment versus insurgency.
The Yang campaign prides itself on the heterodoxy of its supporters.
â€œI poll 18 percent among college Republicans,â€ Mr. Yang told me.
â€œIâ€™ve got a higher appeal among independents, libertarians and even some disaffected Trump voters than Joe Biden by the numbers, than Bernie Sanders by the numbers.â€ One of his campaign slogans is â€œNot Left.
Not Right.
Forward.â€  The writer Wesley Yang has suggested that the in-between nature of Asian-Americans â€” the way they are often regarded neither as white nor as people of color â€” allows them â€œto say and do things that white liberals are now afraid to say and do, which is to stand up for certain fundamental values.â€  When you consider Mr. Yangâ€™s positions on some of the touchiest aspects of the culture war and imagine his views coming out of the mouth of a Michael Bennet or a Pete Buttigieg, you can easily see the truth of this insight.
For instance: Heâ€™s glad that America has become â€œless of a monoculture.â€ (When he was a kid, he says, his own â€œefforts to be American included things like joining the wrestling teamâ€; he was terrible at the sport.)
But, he added, â€œI think thereâ€™s a middle ground where you canâ€™t just say America is nothing and everybody run off and do your own thing.â€ Itâ€™s important, he said, to have a â€œcommon cultural context and even â€” and this will be very controversial â€” a common language of expression.â€  I spoke to some of his many Asian-American supporters, and this resonated with them.
Michael Chen, a 19-year-old Drexel student at one of the New Hampshire town hall events, said he appreciated that Mr. Yang, whose immigrant father grew up in a house with a dirt floor on a peanut farm, is not running on his identity: â€œYou can be Asian-American, you can be black American, you can be Latino-American, but the common denominator is American.
Thatâ€™s who he is.â€  Mr. Chen was there with his dad, Jack.
The elder Mr. Chen calls himself a â€œYang junkieâ€ but insists being Asian has â€œlittle to do with it.â€ What animates him is the practicality of Mr. Yangâ€™s solutions.
Mr. Yang believes in talking to people he disagrees with.
In April, he appeared on â€œThe Ben Shapiro Show,â€ a no-go zone for those who buy into the new politics of contamination â€” that to sit next to a conservative like Mr. Shapiro is to tacitly endorse his ideas.
â€œThinking that Iâ€™m going to catch ideas from someone seems ludicrous to me,â€ he said.
Soon after the comedian Shane Gillis was hired by â€œSaturday Night Live,â€ it was revealed that he had used racial slurs on podcasts, including describing Mr. Yang with an anti-Semitic and racist epithet.
Mr. Yang tweeted that he didnâ€™t think Mr. Gillis should be fired, writing, â€œWe would benefit from being more forgiving rather than punitive.â€ The show didnâ€™t follow Mr. Yangâ€™s advice.
I asked Mr. Yang, who ran one of the top test prep programs in the country before it was bought by Kaplan, about his views on affirmative action.
Is Harvard doing to Asians in the 21st century what it did to Jews in the 20th?
â€œHarvardâ€™s gonna Harvard,â€ he said.
He told me that he himself was rejected from the school â€” he wound up at Brown â€” though he was amply qualified.
But â€œif you have any kind of perspective,â€ he said, you realize that â€œmy life and my humanity depends on more than whether some institution decides to stamp my hand.â€  â€œArguing for higher representation of an already overrepresented group â€” at least according to population standards â€” would not be my first bone to pick,â€ he said.
Instead, he asked why Harvard, a university with a $40 billion endowment, is â€œopening locations in Shanghai but not Ohio or Michigan.â€ The real question, he said, is, â€œAre you trying to advance our society or are you trying to advance global moneyed interests?â€  On New Yearâ€™s Eve it occurred to me that, despite living in New York, which prides itself on being the most cosmopolitan city in the world, I had not been in a room with such a politically diverse group of people since Donald Trump was elected president.
If there is a typical Yang voter it is a former Bernie Sanders supporter who feels that Mr. Yang understands the challenges of the 21st century better than a 78-year-old socialist without a single app on his phone.
Mr. Yang supported Mr. Sanders in 2016, before voting for Hillary Clinton in the general election (â€œIâ€™m pro-civilization,â€ he said).
He understands why young voters are drawn to Mr. Sanders.
â€œIf youâ€™re a young person you look up and say, â€˜What have I experienced from this capitalist system?â€™ Corporate abuse, crashes, bailouts, greed, record levels of college debt.â€ But he insists the best actor to improve peopleâ€™s lives is â€œnot our government, itâ€™s us.â€  â€œBernieâ€™s saying, â€˜Letâ€™s stick it to the billionaires and all will be well,â€™â€ he said.
â€œIâ€™m saying, â€˜We need to rewrite the code, we need to rewrite the software.â€™â€  At a campaign stop in Manchester, N.H., I spoke with Sunny Payne, a 23-year-old Yang supporter whoâ€™d come in from Bangor, Me., and uses the pronoun they.
â€œWhile I think Bernie Sanders is an amazing person,â€ they said, â€œheâ€™s has had the exact same policy stances for literally decades.â€  Amberly McCabe and Martin Raucher, both 29, are also former Sanders supporters.
They drove 25 hours from St. Petersburg, Fla.
They made sure not to cut anyone off on the highway, Ms. McCabe said, because thereâ€™s a Yang bumper sticker on their car and â€œwe have to represent.â€  Mr. Raucher is a disabled veteran and Ms. McCabe is an artist; they met through their passion: spinning fire.
It wasnâ€™t possible to twirl lit torches inside the party room, so Ms. McCabe had fashioned the next best thing: a handmade light-up Yang sign.
â€œWith Yang Iâ€™m all about the ideas, the policies,â€ she said, above all, his proposal for a universal basic income of $1,000 a month.
â€œI need an oil change,â€ said Mr. Raucher, when I asked how theyâ€™d spend it.
â€œAnd my roof is leaking.â€  Just across the dance floor were Elasa and Russell Peterson, two former Trump voters who changed their registration â€” and moved states â€” to support Mr. Yangâ€™s candidacy.
â€œEveryone I know is the broke-folk vote,â€ said Mr. Peterson.
They are among them.
Until recently they worked at a North Carolina Olive Garden.
(â€œI got to where I hated breadsticks,â€ said Ms.
Peterson.)
â€œDonald Trump stands up there and says, â€˜Hey, we got to build the wall because the immigrants are coming over here and theyâ€™re stealing our jobs.â€™ And you know what?
Because weâ€™re all broke weâ€™re all like: â€˜Itâ€™s immigrants!
Yeah!
Letâ€™s build the wall!â€™â€ Mr. Peterson said.
â€œBut then you hear Andrew Yang talk and heâ€™s like, â€˜You know what?
Itâ€™s not immigrants.
Itâ€™s automation.â€™ You go into Walmart, you donâ€™t see immigrants.
You see self-serve checkouts.
Itâ€™s like a light bulb goes off.
Like, â€˜Wow, this makes sense.â€™â€  It made so much sense that they moved in with Ms. Petersonâ€™s sister in Vermont, 10 minutes from the New Hampshire border, so they could volunteer full-time for the campaign and promote him on their YouTube channel.
â€œEverybody in our family has been Yanged.
And they were all Trumpers,â€ Mr. Peterson said.
At a town hall event attended by some 300 people on New Yearâ€™s Day, the first question â€” so on-brand I almost assumed it was a plant â€” was about the metric system: â€œSo, Mr. Make Americans Think Harder, can we count on President Yang to support the blessings of the metric system?â€  The crowd laughed.
Amazingly, Mr. Yang came back with a thoughtful answer about how the metric system is safer, not least because it is more accurate for micro-dosing baby medicine.
To hear Andrew Yang talk is to understand why it is possible for people like the Petersons to support him: Unlike the president, he never demonizes other Americans.
â€œThe differences between us are pretty trivial compared to the things we share in common.
And thatâ€™s a fundamental message of the campaign: Able-bodied special needs, white black, old young, rural urban, weâ€™re all going to get run over by this automation freight train,â€ he said.
â€œWe need to human up and stop focusing on relatively trivial distinctions.â€  The villain is not Donald Trump, but a market rigged for Big Tech and against normal Americans.
In Mr. Yangâ€™s framing of the 2016 election, Mrs. Clinton lost not because of the Electoral College or Russian bots, but because she fundamentally misunderstood the crisis facing America.
â€œDonald Trump said he was going to make America great again.
And what did Hillary Clinton say in response?
America is already great,â€ Mr. Yang said.
â€œThat message did not work because the pain in our country is real.â€  In other words: Donald Trump is the wrong answer to the right question.
Mr. Yang believes he is the right one.
At each one of the four campaign stops I went to, he asked the crowd why President Trump won.
The audience called out answers: The media.
Russia.
Racism.
Hillary.
Facebook.
Twitter.
James Comey.
No, said Mr. Yang.
Itâ€™s because â€œwe blasted away four million manufacturing jobsâ€ through automation in states like Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Missouri and Iowa.
What happened to manufacturing is coming to retail, restaurants and even accounting and the law, Mr. Yang insists.
While Mr. Sanders suggests a federal government job guarantee, and Joe Biden suggests turning coal miners into coders, Mr. Yang says that work as we have known it is over.
If we donâ€™t change anything, I asked him, where will be 50 years from now?
Best-case scenario?
â€œWe will see inequality at a staggering scale that right now most Americans would find unthinkable.â€  And in the worst case?
â€œThe collapse of the government in its current form, political break up, and societal dysfunction that results in mass riots and violence.â€  Itâ€™s impressive that, for the most part, his good humor softens the bleak message he is conveying.
Itâ€™s a vision of the future â€” one disputed as hysterical by many observers â€” that makes President Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerican carnageâ€ address look almost rosy by comparison.
I caught up with Sunny Payne this week.
Hearing Mr. Yang in person â€œlit the fire under me,â€ they said as they drove around Anderson, S.C., after a day spent door-knocking for him.
Theyâ€™d just spent a week in Iowa before realizing that â€œI wanted to spread the message to black voters and communities of color and I realized the best place for me to do that was in South Carolina.â€  They said they kept hearing the same story from voters: â€œI canâ€™t care about climate change because I need to put food on the table.
I have three jobs.
I barely sleep.â€  To these people, Sunny Payne said, $1,000 a month would be life-changing.
Thatâ€™s the reason that the comedian Dave Chappelle has endorsed Mr. Yang.
â€œThe wealth disparity between me and my neighbors is immense; itâ€™s heartbreaking,â€ said Mr. Chappelle, who lives in Ohio, but appeared alongside Mr. Yang on the campaign trail this week.
â€œIf you know a third of the people up the street canâ€™t buy groceries, then you start to feel an imperative concern,â€ he said.
â€œThis is without irony or a punch line, Iâ€™m just telling you â€” this guyâ€™s got some great ideas, you should check it out.â€  So have I been Yanged?
I donâ€™t know if a universal basic income is the best solution to the problem of inequality.
Iâ€™m not particularly passionate about lowering the voting age to 16 or requiring police officers to get purple belts in jujitsu.
I worry about whether someone with zero foreign policy experience can be the commander in chief.
But as Bernie Sanders sells class rage, Joe Biden promises normalcy and Elizabeth Warren pushes a social progressivism so perfectly doctrinaire it seems tailored for five kids at Oberlin, Andrew Yangâ€™s iconoclasm and optimism are refreshing.
If getting Yanged means that I believe that this curious campaign is a cause for that rarest thing in current American politics â€” hope â€” and that Mr. Yang is modeling how to harness the populist energy that otherwise threatens to tear us apart, then count me #YangGang.
Americaâ€™s Public Restrooms Are Kind of Great Now By Farhad Manjoo Dec. 11, 2019  In the past few years, something amazing has been quietly happening across the land.
Public restrooms in America â€” long a flash point of exclusion by race, gender, class and ability â€” have gotten much, much better.
Thanks to an increasingly effective campaign by a range of activists, Americaâ€™s public bathrooms are now cleaner, more plentiful, more private, and more accessible and inclusive than ever.
In many places, theyâ€™re even great.
This is a story about identity politics, advocacy, design and architecture.
It is also a story still in motion, with progress yet to unfold and many people still shut out.
There is still much controversy surrounding our bathrooms, who gets to use them and how.
But itâ€™s important to recognize progress as itâ€™s happening.
And if you travel across America, now, itâ€™s undeniable that how we go keeps getting better.
How do I know?
At the risk of T.M.I., I happen to be an expert on bathrooms.
Twenty years ago, when I was a senior in college, I was diagnosed with a condition called achalasia, a rare, sometimes genetic swallowing disorder that I was actually quite familiar with, because when I was a kid, my mother had it, too.
It began as a blinding, burning bolt of pain in the middle of my chest after eating.
Imagine heartburn after youâ€™ve eaten something spicy, but amped up to 11, as if the thing youâ€™d eaten was a chain saw doused in ghost peppers.
The pain would abate after a few minutes, but it would come back again and again, usually after Iâ€™d eaten a big meal.
Then it began to hurt during big meals, then during every meal, and soon anytime Iâ€™d try to swallow anything.
For many people the condition is curable through surgery, but for me that long-ago flash of pain turned out to be only the beginning of an all-consuming, chronic and often embarrassing disability.
Over the last two decades, though Iâ€™ve undergone dozens of invasive procedures and tests, taken a panoply of pills and had various parts of my digestive system removed or surgically rebuilt, my symptoms have only gotten more intense and more â€” how to put this delicately?
â€” expansive.
Swallowing food is now an arduous enough task that I have to get much of my nutrition through liquid: As Kanye once rapped, â€œI drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert.â€ But itâ€™s no longer just eating thatâ€™s a pain; itâ€™s what happens after, too.
From the nave to the chops, my swallowing problem has spawned a gross-out comedyâ€™s worth of G.I.
complications.
The ugly upshot is this: At least once every day and sometimes many times, I have to run to the restroom on a momentâ€™s notice, and what happens to me there is best experienced alone, in blissful, unembarrassed solitude.
I tell you all this, in order to establish my bona fides: I know public bathrooms.
In my travels, over the years, I have assembled in my head a veritable Michelin Guide of private, peaceful places to go.
So trust me when I tell you that in the last few years, better public bathrooms have started to pop up everywhere.
Again and again, in big cities and small, in red states and blue, in airports, hotels, shopping malls, theaters, stadiums, offices and a range of other public venues, Iâ€™ve been saved by a bounty of better loos.
More restrooms are now explicitly inclusive and accessible, designed for people who are physically disabled; are gender nonconforming; are traveling with children; or are otherwise in need of special accommodation.
(For instance, paruresis and parcopresis, phobias that inhibit people from urinating or defecating in public restrooms, are real, debilitating conditions that affect tens of millions of people.)
One innovation that has been of particular use to me is the lockable, single-occupancy, all-gender restroom.
A decade ago, in most public places, it was nigh impossible to find a private place to do your business.
Today, these one-person stalls are a rising trend across the country, especially at airports and other large public facilities.
In some places theyâ€™re labeled â€œall genderâ€ restrooms; in others, theyâ€™re called â€œfamilyâ€ bathrooms; in yet others, signs welcome everyone with broad language, like, â€œAll persons may use this restroom.â€ Whatever you call them, theyâ€™re a haven in a world marked by chaos and disorder.
Over the last few years, when nature called suddenly and panic set in, Iâ€™ve had the fortune of finding a clean, private place at, among other locations, the Guggenheim in New York; the Getty Center in Los Angeles; the Mall of America; a dozen airports, at least; and so, so many Starbucks.
Of course, things still arenâ€™t perfect.
I am a member of a racial minority, but Iâ€™m a cisgender person of means and social privilege.
Itâ€™s likely that a lot of people still find it hard to find clean, private restrooms in much of the land.
Still, the restroom situation in America is much better than it used to be and, Iâ€™ve noticed, so much better than in many other parts of the world.
On a trip to Britain and France with my kids last year, I was surprised at how difficult it was to find a clean, private bathroom; when there was one, you often had to pay to use it.
Iâ€™ve seen some very nice bathrooms in Dubai, but only in places that cater to the wealthy.
In South Africa and India?
Forget about it.
America has less and less to be proud of these days; our life expectancies are falling, our infrastructure is crumbling, and our politics are in the toilet.
But look at our toilets!
While thereâ€™s no official metric on this sort of thing, in my estimation American toilets are now likely among the top in the world.
Japanâ€™s loos are said to be very nice; if we canâ€™t be No.
1, itâ€™s possible weâ€™re at least, you know, No.
2.
If itâ€™s true that our toilets are getting better, itâ€™s worth asking why.
In a word: activists.
In the last few years, a range of advocates fighting on behalf of transgender people, the disabled, homeless people and others have mounted a variety of legal and public advocacy campaigns aimed at making bathrooms more accessible.
These have sometimes sparked backlash and controversy, like the 2016 law in North Carolina that rolled back gender-inclusive restrooms.
At the Supreme Court this fall, justices considering a case about gay and transgender rights couldnâ€™t stop themselves from considering everything through the lens of the loo.
Despite the political controversy, on the ground, in facilities all over the country, the moral arc of the bathroom is bending toward inclusion.
At Starbucks, after a viral incident last year in which two black men who had asked to use the restroom were arrested at a Philadelphia location, the restrooms are now open to everyone, even people who havenâ€™t purchased anything.
Cities are now spending money to create more public restrooms.
And earlier this year, Stalled!, an organization of designers and activists who push for restroom-related social justice, mounted a successful campaign to get the International Plumbing Code â€” which sets standards for bathrooms â€” to adopt new language supporting all-gender restrooms.
â€œInclusive designâ€ has been a hot new term among architects and product designers; the idea, broadly, is that when you create products and spaces that are accommodating of a broad range of human capacity, they end up being much more useful to everyone in unexpected ways.
Advocates of inclusive design point to some canonical examples: Sidewalk ramps were put in place for people with wheelchairs, but they turned out to be handy for parents with strollers, too.
Some of the technology in the smartphoneâ€™s touchscreen was invented as a way to help people with disabilities like carpal tunnel syndrome.
Typewriters and keyboards were first created to help the blind.
Restrooms are following a similar path.
Itâ€™s not just obviously disabled and gender-nonconforming people who need a private, more accessible restroom.
Everyone, now and again, can do with a nicer place to go to the bathroom.
In America, at long last, weâ€™re getting that.
Thank you, social justice warriors.
Elizabeth Warren Throws Down the Gauntlet By Elisabeth Rosenthal Nov. 4, 2019  Laying the table for the next Democratic debate, Elizabeth Warren has issued a plan that explains how she would fund what she calls Medicare for All.
She had studiously avoided saying whether it would raise taxes for the middle class, and in her proposal, she says (repeatedly) it will not.
It will instead be financed by a mix of wealth taxes, employer transfers of money they currently spend on health care and reductions of the many inefficiencies in our current byzantine system â€” among other initiatives.
But now all the candidates need to tell us more of those details about their health care strategies.
Itâ€™s time for the candidates to stop talking slogans and start talking sense â€” or dollars and cents â€” so that voters can know what they mean and choose among them.
Medicare for All, Medicare for All Who Want It, a public option, improving the Affordable Care Act â€” those are 30,000-foot concepts that, depending on the details, could work (or not) and be popular (or not).
The candidates (including Ms. Warren) also need to say more about what theyâ€™ll do right now: In one poll, 40 percent of Americans said they had skipped a recommended test or treatment, and 32 percent said they had skipped a medicine, because of cost.
Supporters of Medicare for All want to tie their future to the popularity of the Medicare program.
But Ms. Warren (and Bernie Sanders) are offering up Americans a supercharged version of the current government insurance for those over 65.
It promises to eliminate co-payments for prescription drugs.
(Under current Medicare, many patients contribute thousands of dollars annually.)
It includes dental and long-term care â€” a huge expense that is conspicuously missing from current Medicare.
That ambition would make a health care plan vastly more expensive.
The national health systems of Britain and Canada, both single payer systems like the Medicare for All proposal, do not offer comprehensive long-term care coverage.
Canadaâ€™s doesnâ€™t include coverage for prescription drugs out of the hospital.
Is the financing Ms. Warren proposes going to be adequate to support the expanded goals?
Economists disagree.
But in releasing her proposal, she has thrown down the gauntlet before the other candidates â€” who support Medicare for All Who Want It or some other type of public option â€” to be a whole lot clearer about what they mean.
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, et al.
: Does your public option â€” a government insurance policy that anyone may buy â€” resemble Mr. Sandersâ€™s enhanced Medicare, or current Medicare or Medicaid, which is far more bare bones?
Voters need to know.
Thereâ€™s another obvious reason the candidates have been so close lipped on specifics: To calculate how to pay for any of the plans, the candidates have to say how they intend to bring down prices â€” for hospital stays, drugs, procedures, devices, doctorsâ€™ visits, surgeries.
Americans often pay two to 10 times what patients pay for these items in other developed countries.
Those prices will have to come down to make any plan viable without breaking the bank.
To really assess any plan, weâ€™ll need that kind of information.
Ms. Warren has courageously stepped into that fraught territory, with numbers that have very likely sent shock waves through the health care industry.
For example, to make her financing proposal work, she suggests paying most hospitals on average 110 percent of current Medicare rates.
She suggests Americans should pay no more for drugs than 110 percent of the average international market price.
That may be eminently reasonable, but is it achievable?
When Montana negotiated rates directly with hospitals for its state employees, it settled on a deal in which the state agreed to pay an average of 234 percent of Medicare rates.
And it still saved money.
Setting lower prices is going to bring out strong opposition.
Remember, patient (or taxpayer) savings mean loss of income for one of Americaâ€™s most profitable industries, whose lobbyists spent more than half a billion dollars last year and which is flush with dark money to distribute in Congress.
To get the A.C.A.
passed, President Barack Obama gave up on a number of price-lowering ideas to get buy-in from the health care industry and its friends in Congress.
These included jettisoning the idea of a public option and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices.
The Republicans â€” whose â€œplansâ€ have been largely proclamations of better, cheaper health care without any strategy â€” will be quick to label any of the Democratic plans as a government takeover of health care, or socialism.
Remember, patient (or taxpayer) savings mean loss of income for the United Statesâ€™ most robust sector in the post-recession economy.
In many post-manufacturing cities like Pittsburgh and Cleveland, a single hospital system is the biggest employer.
In Boston, hospitals and hospital corporations make up the top six employers.
Minnesota and Massachusetts have done well with drug and device manufacturing.
And letâ€™s not start on insurers, whose lucrative health business would largely disappear.
Any plan to rein in the United Statesâ€™ bloated $3.5 trillion health care system will be slow going, requiring not just a footnoted blueprint but also the taming of many opposing forces.
It took years for Canada to move from a market-based system to government run health.
It endured lengthy debates and doctorsâ€™ strikes.
Ms. Warren calls her proposal a â€œlong-term plan.â€ But voters want to know how we get from here to anywhere else.
In polls, their top health care issue is affordability â€” emphasis on now.
They need concrete proposals as well as long-term vision.
In the next debate, how about talking about H.R.
3, a bill in Congress to curb prescription drug prices?
That plan would allow the health and human services secretary to negotiate a maximum price that could be charged to Medicare for insulin and some of the most expensive medicines in the United States, based on the prices paid for those drugs in other countries.
Days before the last Democratic debate, the Congressional Budget Office said it would save $345 billion over a six-year period (2023-29).
If the bill were to move to the Senate, how would the front-runners vote?
What do they have to say about that?
Four Key Things You Should Know About Health Care By Ezekiel J. Emanuel and Victor R. Fuchs Sept. 12, 2019  Health care, so far perhaps the biggest issue in the Democratic primary, is also the most complicated issue facing government and the public.
Unfortunately the debate is filled with persistent misconceptions, from the role insurance company profits play in health care costs to who is actually paying for workersâ€™ health coverage.
Clarifying four fundamental health care fallacies could make it easier for voters to square some of the Democratic proposals â€” and their critiques â€” with reality:  Fallacy No.
1: Employers pay for employeesâ€™ health insurance.
Employers write checks that cover most health insurance premiums for employees and their dependents.
But as the Princeton health economist Uwe Reinhardt once explained, employer-sponsored insurance is like a pickpocket taking money out of your wallet at a bar and buying you a drink.
You appreciate the cocktail until you realize you paid for it yourself.
With health coverage, employers write the check to the insurer, but employees bear the cost of the premium â€” the entire premium, not just the portion listed as their contribution on their pay stub.
The premium money that goes to the insurance company is cash that employers would otherwise deposit in employeesâ€™ accounts like the rest of their salary.
The fallacy is in thinking an employerâ€™s contribution comes out of profits.
In fact, higher health insurance premiums mean lower wages for workers.
Since 1999, health insurance premiums have increased 147 percent and employer profits have increased 148 percent.
But in that time, average wages have hardly moved, increasing just 7 percent.
Clearly workersâ€™ wages, not corporate profits, have been paying for higher health insurance premiums.
Health care costs are one â€” though not the only â€” reason wages have stagnated over the last few decades.
With health insurance costs rising faster than growth in the economy, more labor costs go to benefits like health insurance and less to take-home pay.
Yet the belief that employees donâ€™t pay for their own health insurance is widespread.
One reason is that individuals cannot be sure what causes their wages to change or remain stagnant for decades.
Another reason is that employers want Americans to believe that they pay for their workersâ€™ health insurance.
Still another reason is that there are those who profit from the employment-based system: drug companies, device manufacturers, specialty physicians and high-income individuals.
They all want you to believe companies are being magnanimous in giving you insurance.
Who else benefits from the belief in this fallacy?
Opponents of national health insurance.
Fallacy No.
2: Medicare for All is unaffordable.
The key to evaluating the cost of Medicare for All is to distinguish between increasing spending on health care and shifting expenditures from private insurance to the federal government.
True, Medicare for All would increase federal health care spending.
But that is not the same as increasing total health care spending, which was over $3.5 trillion last year.
Instead, Medicare for All would move money from one column (private health insurance spending) to another (federal health spending); it does not automatically increase total costs.
A recent study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University â€” a free-market center generally hostile to government programs â€” estimates that for the 10 years between 2022 and 2031 the total national health costs for Senator Bernie Sandersâ€™s Medicare for All plan would actually be $50.1 trillion.
That would be $2 trillion less than if we let the system operate as it currently does.
However, Mercatus researchers doubt that the Sandersâ€™s plan would ultimately save trillions because they believe Congress would have to increase Medicare rates paid to hospitals and physicians to get the legislation enacted.
They may be right â€” or wrong.
But that is a different argument â€” a prediction about the politics of enacting laws â€” than that Medicare for All would inherently increase total health care spending.
We have our doubts about Medicare for All.
But unaffordability is not a reason to oppose it.
Whether itâ€™s our current arrangement or a future Medicare for All, the per capita cost of our health care system already far exceeds that of any other industrialized country â€” including those with single-payer systems.
When you hear a health care price tag in the trillions, know that the existing system has already brought us there.
Fallacy No.
3: Insurance companiesâ€™ profits drive health care costs.
In the second Democratic presidential debate, Senator Bernie Sanders declared that the health care industry makes $100 billion in profits.
He once railed against the insurance company Anthem for denying a claim while noting that it reported â€œfourth-quarter profits for 2017 had increased by 234 percent to $1.2 billion.â€  Many Americans believe that profits have no place in health care.
They see for-profit health insurance, like buying and selling kidneys and livers for transplantation, as what the Nobel Prize winner Alvin Roth termed a â€œrepugnant industryâ€ â€” something that should not be exchanged in the market.
That is an important moral stand, but it makes no difference to the claim that eliminating for-profit insurers will reduce high health care costs.
The fact is, we could eliminate those profits and it would hardly matter to the cost of health care.
You would not notice it in your premiums.
For the eight largest for-profit health insurance companies, in 2016, their cumulative revenue amounted to nearly $452.2 billion and profits were $22.1 billion, for a profit margin of about 5 percent.
By contrast, technology companies, banks and major drug companies generally make more than 20 percent profit.
True, $22.1 billion is a lot of money â€” but it is 0.6 percent of health spending.
And last year alone health care costs increased over $130 billion â€” six times insurance company profits.
Health care spending would not be significantly cheaper if all insurance companiesâ€™ profits were zero.
There are far more savings to be had in other efforts â€” by cutting unnecessary patient services, for example, or by making physicians and hospitals more efficient â€” to deliver the same care at a lower cost.
Fallacy No.
4: Price transparency can bring down health care costs.
â€œHospitals will be required to publish prices that reflect what people pay for services,â€ said President Trump when he signed his executive order on health care price transparency.
â€œPrices will come down by numbers that you wouldnâ€™t believe.
The cost of health care will go way, way down.â€  There is no doubt that prices for medical procedures can range widely even within the same city or state.
For instance, M.R.I.s of the spine can vary threefold in Massachusetts and mammograms fivefold in San Francisco.
Conservatives argue that informing patients of prices for tests and treatments will induce them to shop for lower-cost services, saving them, insurers and the country money.
In theory, the beauty of price transparency is that neither the government nor insurers impose cost controls; the invisible hand of the market does it all.
Yet demonstrations of price transparency have been tried many times in many places, and in reality, it has not reduced the cost of care.
One recent study by Harvard Medical School researchers involved hundreds of thousands of employees and used a website telling them what they would pay out-of-pocket if they chose particular physicians and hospitals.
The result: no savings.
A follow-up study using another set of employers and another price transparency tool found the same result: no savings.
Since 2007, New Hampshire has had a state website, N.H. Health Cost, that allows patients to select a medical procedure, insurer and ZIP code and then get a list of prices for the procedure from various providers.
The most promising study of N.H. Health Cost suggests a few million dollars in savings per year.
That works out to be about $5 per New Hampshire resident.
The fact is, price transparency will not make health care costs â€œgo way, way down.â€ Health insurance insulates the patient from price.
Over 80 percent of the cost of medical care is paid by private and public insurance.
Patients have little incentive to seek out the cheapest provider.
When pricing websites exist, few patients use them.
Even in the most favorable studies, when offered a price transparency tool, only 12 percent of patients took advantage of it; usually itâ€™s less than 4 percent of patients.
Furthermore, price considerations are useful for choosing only about 40 percent of procedures â€” routine services like colonoscopies, M.R.I.
scans and laboratory tests.
Most of the expensive services â€” think heart catheterizations, cancer chemotherapy and organ transplants â€” are not the kind of thing you decide based on price.
Finally, in health care, Americans usually put relationships ahead of money.
Once patients find a physician they trust and a hospital they like, they tend to stick with them even if there is a lower-cost alternative nearby.
***  American health care is complex and any simplistic solution is likely to be based on a fallacy.
But that doesnâ€™t mean there is nothing we can do.
There are solutions â€” they just donâ€™t make for bumper sticker phrases like Medicare for All or Eliminate For-Profit Insurers or Price Transparency.
George Soros: Mark Zuckerberg Should Not Be in Control of Facebook By George Soros Jan. 31, 2020  At a dinner last week in Davos, Switzerland, I was asked if I thought Facebook was behaving more responsibly today than it did during the 2016 presidential election.
â€œNot at all,â€ I answered.
â€œFacebook helped Trump to get elected and I am afraid that it will do the same in 2020.â€ I explained that there is a longstanding law â€” Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act â€” that protects social media platforms from legal liability for defamation and similar claims.
Facebook can post deliberately misleading or false statements by candidates for public office and others, and take no responsibility for them.
I went on to say that there appears to be â€œan informal mutual assistance operation or agreement developing between Trump and Facebookâ€ in which Facebook will help President Trump to get re-elected and Mr. Trump will, in turn, defend Facebook against attacks from regulators and the media.
â€œThis is just plain wrong,â€ a Facebook spokesman told Business Insider.
I disagree.
I believe that Mr. Trump and Facebookâ€™s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, realize that their interests are aligned â€” the presidentâ€™s in winning elections, Mr. Zuckerbergâ€™s in making money.
Letâ€™s look at the evidence: In 2016, Facebook provided the Trump campaign with embedded staff who helped to optimize its advertising program.
(Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign was also approached, but it declined to embed a Facebook team in her campaignâ€™s operations.)
Brad Parscale, the digital director of Mr. Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign and now his campaign manager for 2020, said that Facebook helped Mr. Trump and gave him the edge.
This seems to have marked the beginning of a special relationship.
More recently, direct contact between the two men has raised serious questions.
Mr. Zuckerberg met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office on Sept. 19, 2019.
We donâ€™t know what was said.
But from an interview on the sidelines at the World Economic Forum on Jan. 22, we do know what Mr. Trump said about the meeting: Mr. Zuckerberg â€œtold me that Iâ€™m No.
1 in the world in Facebook.â€ Mr. Trump apparently had no problem with Facebookâ€™s decision not to fact-check political ads.
â€œIâ€™d rather have him just do whatever he is going to do,â€ Mr. Trump said of Mr. Zuckerberg.
â€œHeâ€™s done a hell of a job, when you think of it.â€  The presidentâ€™s 2016 campaign mounted a robust data-centric communications effort and has continued to build on that program over the past few years, using Facebook as a key part of their strategy.
Facebookâ€™s decision not to require fact-checking for political candidatesâ€™ advertising in 2020 has flung open the door for false, manipulated, extreme and incendiary statements.
Such content is rewarded with prime placement and promotion if it meets Facebook-designed algorithmic standards for popularity and engagement.
Whatâ€™s more, Facebookâ€™s design tends to obscure the sources of inflammatory and false content, and fails to adequately punish those who spread false information.
Nor does the company effectively warn those who are exposed to lies.
I expressed my fear that with Facebookâ€™s help, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election.
The recent hiring of a right-wing figure to help manage its news tab has reinforced those fears.
In my comments in Davos, I also pointed out that Facebook has been used to cause worse damage in other countries than the United States.
In Myanmar, for example, military personnel used Facebook to help incite the public against the Rohingya, who were targeted in a military assault of incredible cruelty including murder, rape and the burning of entire villages: Around 700,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh.
The International Court of Justice in The Hague is currently deliberating whether these atrocities qualify as genocide.
But within the last year, Facebook has introduced new features on its mobile app that actually intensify the fire of incendiary political attacks â€” making them easier and quicker to propagate.
The system is cost-free to the poster and revenue-generating for Facebook.
Good for Facebook, bad for democracy.
The responsible approach is self-evident.
Facebook is a publisher not just a neutral moderator or â€œplatform.â€ It should be held accountable for the content that appears on its site.
Speaking at a cocktail party in Davos on Jan. 22, Facebookâ€™s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, repeated the worn Silicon Valley clichÃ© that Facebook is trying to make the world a better place.
But Facebook should be judged by what it does, not what it says.
I repeat and reaffirm my accusation against Facebook under the leadership of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg.
They follow only one guiding principle: maximize profits irrespective of the consequences.
One way or another, they should not be left in control of Facebook.
Give Joe Biden His Due By Frank Bruni Dec. 20, 2019  Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren are the shiny objects.
Joe Biden just may be the keepsake that endures.
The other two went at it on Thursday night, quarreling over the meaning and morality of a wine cave, in an exchange that distilled the Democratic primaryâ€™s broader tension between pragmatism and purity, compromise and idealism.
Biden was careful not to be drawn too far into it and, during other stretches of the debate, stood back.
Why wouldnâ€™t he?
For all the worry because he sometimes stutters, for all the concern because he occasionally sputters, for all his corny locutions (â€œmalarkeyâ€) and reflexive conversation fillers (â€œhereâ€™s the dealâ€), the former vice president has almost consistently maintained a lead over his Democratic rivals in national polls since he announced his candidacy last April.
He has recently gained ground in Iowa, the state that votes first, meaning that he may avoid what had been looking like a candidacy-imperiling embarrassment there.
He has survived salvos from critics and messes of his own that were supposed to halt or at least hobble him: the attention to his crossing-the-line physicality with women; the flip-flop about public funding of abortions; the back-and-forth with Kamala Harris about busing; the moment at the fifth Democratic primary debate when he seemed to forget either that she was in the Senate or that she was black.
All of that supposedly made him look weak.
But none of that appreciably weakened him.
And at the latest debate, he performed better than before â€” which may not be saying a lot but is saying something.
He still canâ€™t speak in a straight line, instead zigging and zagging: If he were a car, his tires would constantly scrape the curb and his hubcaps would probably pop off.
But they stayed on this time around.
Biden, 77, seemed more relaxed and confident, and he radiated his trademark warmth.
Itâ€™s difficult not to like him.
And itâ€™s time to give him his due.
So many of us havenâ€™t, and Iâ€™m as guilty as anyone.
In past columns I urged him not to run â€” citing his unsuccessful previous presidential bids, his age, his eccentricities and his outright flaws â€” and doubted his ability to go the distance.
I joined other pundits and political analysts in treating Bidenâ€™s front-runner status as fictive or inevitably fleeting and as the bequest of simple name recognition.
We decreed that other contenders â€” Harris for an instant, Warren and Buttigieg for longer, even Bernie Sanders of late â€” had momentum.
Biden had vestigial good will, which we regarded as a less flashy and flimsier commodity.
When we examined Biden, we saw warning signs.
Look at that light schedule!
Check out those anemic fund-raising numbers!
Sure, many Democratic voters deemed him the most electable alternative at a juncture when snatching back the White House mattered infinitely more to them than any romance with a figure fresher and more inspiring than he is.
But would they stick?
And could he last?
So far, so good â€” or, rather, so Biden, which in Thursday nightâ€™s debate meant a quizzical reference to Winston Churchill, some endearingly loose banter with Sanders and an overarching aura of sheer good-naturedness.
When one of the moderators, Tim Alberta of Politico, brought up the subject of age, Biden said: â€œLook, Iâ€™m running because Iâ€™ve been around.
All my experience.
With experience, hopefully, comes judgment and a little bit of wisdom.â€  Alberta noted that if Biden won the presidency, heâ€™d be 82 at the end of his first term.
â€œAre you willing to commit tonight to running for a second term?â€  â€œNo, Iâ€™m not willing to commit one way or another,â€ Biden said without pause, to supportive laughter from the audience.
â€œHereâ€™s the deal.
Iâ€™m not even elected one term yet, and letâ€™s see where we are.
But itâ€™s a nice thought.â€ It was a nice answer.
Moderators gave him ample opportunity to stumble, challenging him, for example, on the Obama administrationâ€™s failure to close GuantÃ¡namo Bay and its exaggeration of progress in the war in Afghanistan.
He had answers at the ready and exhibited zero discomfort.
While he was evasive about a few topics, he was emphatic about his disagreement with Sanders and Warren on â€œMedicare for all.â€ And he leapt into the fray to explain that he finds that plan exorbitant and far-fetched.
â€œIâ€™m the only guy thatâ€™s not interrupted,â€ he said.
â€œAll right, Iâ€™m going to interrupt now.â€ This from a man who, at a previous debate, cut himself off even before moderators did.
I maintain serious reservations about him.
Thirty-six years in the Senate and eight in the vice presidency add up not just to enormous experience but also to a sprawling record thatâ€™s a gold mine for detractors.
He undeniably lacks the vigor he once possessed.
And President Trumpâ€™s cynical airing of questions about his past dealings with Ukraine â€” and about the lucrative position that his son Hunter had on the board of the natural gas company Burisma â€” remains a potential liability for Biden, who still hasnâ€™t found and delivered the perfect rebuttal.
But journalists may not have the right antenna for how this is playing out.
When Biden admonished a man in Iowa who credulously parroted Trumpâ€™s line of attack, many political analysts pronounced him imprudently thin-skinned and unattractively defensive.
But many voters surely saw him as authentic, relatable â€” a loving father and decent person disgusted with the nastiness coming his way.
Thereâ€™s an upside to trading a safe, conventional political script for something rawer.
Trump demonstrated that in 2016.
And on Thursday night, Biden reasserted the fundamental generosity of spirit that separates him from Trump and is like a tall, cold glass of water to Americans thirsty for decency.
â€œI refuse to accept the notion, as some on this stage do, that we can never, never get to a place where we have cooperation again,â€ he said, making a pitch for bipartisanship.
â€œIf thatâ€™s the case, we are dead as a country.
We need to be able to reach a consensus.
And if anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate, itâ€™s me â€” the way theyâ€™ve attacked me, my son and my family.â€  He got fresh reason during the debate, when Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former White House press secretary, sent out a tweet that ridiculed his stutter.
She deleted it â€” and apologized â€” after he asked her where her empathy had gone, a question I assumed was rhetorical.
It died on the altar of Trump, where too many other Republicans sacrificed their principles, too.
Biden glows in comparison.
He almost looks shiny.
Gone With the Windsors By Maureen Dowd Jan. 11, 2020  I never had much use for the queen.
Maybe itâ€™s the Irish in me.
As Winston Churchill said: â€œWeâ€™ve always found the Irish a bit odd.
They refuse to be English.â€  Or maybe itâ€™s the American in me.
We did go to an awful lot of trouble to break away from that corgi-and-gin-loving racket 244 years ago.
At some visceral level, though, America must regret being torn away from the royal family.
How else to explain our enduring fascination with dynasties?
Having spent my career covering four dysfunctional political dynasties, I rebel more than ever at the idea that biology entitles you to authority.
The ghost of Diana gone rogue animates the fractured fairy tale of Meghan and Harry, and their intemperate attempt to upend centuries of starchy rules and break away from the Firm.
Princess Diâ€™s dangerous tango with the tabloids left Harry with no taste to play that game again, especially with streaks of racism against Markle added to the mix.
He recently confessed that every click or flash of a camera brought memories of his motherâ€™s death racing back into his mind.
I covered Dianaâ€™s first trip as the Princess of Wales to America in 1985.
She seemed happy then, in that year before Charles resumed his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles.
She and the prince shared amused eye contact, winks and teasing remarks.
Nancy Reagan planned an evening of candlelit dancing at the White House worthy of a 24-year-old Cinderella in a midnight blue velvet gown.
Mrs. Reagan arranged for the Marine Band to play â€œNight Feverâ€ as John Travolta spun a euphoric Diana around the floor.
(â€œSheâ€™s a great little mover,â€ he said afterward.)
I wondered how Prince Charles would deal with a young wife with so much star power, absorbing so much attention.
We were all mesmerized when she tucked her chin down in that shy pose and cast that modest yet saucy look up at us.
The answer was: He did not deal with it well.
Twelve years later, when the unimaginable tragedy hit, the royal ice cubes were furious at the expectation that they should emote for the woman who had publicly ripped the monarchy as a bloodless, soulless gang and christened herself the Prisoner of Wales.
The Firm was out of its depth then, and it is again now.
How can the queen and Prince Philip and Prince Charles possibly understand the desire of Meghan and Harry to rebrand as a Goopish lifestyle enterprise?
The news that they have applied to trademark hundreds of items, from socks to hoodies, under the â€œSussex Royalâ€ logo makes Wallis Simpsonâ€™s exile in the Bahamas, spent matching the color on the walls to her face powder, seem positively monastic.
Can you really call yourself â€œfinancially independentâ€ when all youâ€™re doing is cashing in on the royal name?
Given the state of the world and the implosion of the British Empire â€” with Scots once more contemplating an off ramp, Irish unity in play, Australia on fire and Boris Johnson tricking the queen into suspending Parliament in a Brexit ploy â€” it is hard to feel sorry for the Duchess of Sussex complaining that her diamonds are heavy.
The pathos for Markle, trapped in a designer cage, goes only so far.
Itâ€™s easy for royals to come to North America, where they are lavishly embraced as celebrities without all those pesky restrictions about class and role.
(See â€œThe Crownâ€ episode about a wild, imbibing Princess Margaret charming L.B.J.)
Still, I think Meghan Markle should have wielded her wokeness where it is most needed â€” in Buckingham Palace.
She could have channeled the Obamas, who did a magnificent job of rising above racist taunts and working within the institution to imprint a new image of racial possibility in America.
Markle had already successfully brought a refreshing dose of semi-radical chic to the royal family.
Her visits to a mosque that housed Londoners displaced by the Grenfell Tower fire led to her putting out a 2018 cookbook, the proceeds of which went to the victims.
At its best, the monarchy has been able to lift up people, as it did during the blitz in World War II.
I saw that ability to alchemize emotions and opinions when I covered the queen on her visit to Ireland in 2011, the first by a British monarch in a century.
It was impossible not to be impressed watching her speak Gaelic and offering regret about how Britain had made Ireland suffer, bowing her head at the scene of Bloody Sunday and the Garden of Remembrance, the sacred ground for slain Irish patriots.
The Irish started out skeptical, but by the end of her visit, many were calling her â€œBettyâ€ on Twitter.
The queen of England holds out the idea that she and her family should have some sort of vestigial moral authority.
But with the Prince Andrew imbroglio in the seraglio of Jeffrey Epstein, and with Harryâ€™s run for the Hollywood Hills, it is clear that many in her family are not interested in moral authority.
The collapse of the authority of the British monarchy mirrors the collapse of authorities generally, scarred by years of scandals about clergymen abusing children, athletes beating up girlfriends and university officials accepting bribes.
And yet, even if the royalsâ€™ role in the culture is now akin to the Kardashians, it wasnâ€™t cool for Meghan and Harry to pants the 93-year-old queen, defy her instructions, dump their Megxit plan on Instagram and intensify the sad split between the brothers.
(If ever there was a time for some dry gin.
â€¦)  Whatâ€™s the rush to give up real influence to be an Instagram influencer?
Besides, who unfollows their own grandmother?
Good for Meghan and Harry By The Editorial Board Jan. 9, 2020  â€œAnd they lived happily ever after,â€ affirm the stories we tell our children about a beautiful commoner marrying Prince Charming.
Just make sure your kids donâ€™t see Thursdayâ€™s headlines in the London dailies.
â€œCivil War as Harry & Meg Quit the Royals,â€ screamed The Sun.
â€œQueenâ€™s Fury as Harry and Meghan Say: We Quit,â€ blared The Daily Mail in a â€œRoyal Bombshell Special Issue.â€ â€œThey Didnâ€™t Even Tell the Queen,â€ lamented The Daily Mirror.
Any other news, from the drums of war in Iran to passage, at last, of a Brexit bill in Parliament was swept away for Megxit, as the tabloids promptly called the decision by Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, to â€œstep backâ€ from the ribbon-cutting, kindergarten-visiting and foreign-traveling duties theyâ€™ve been assigned as their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.
They will try, they said in a statement posted on Instagram Wednesday, â€œto become financially independentâ€ and to balance their lives between Britain and North America.
How that will work is hard to predict.
No one has ever resigned from the â€œFirm,â€ as the British call the royal clan, though some have been exiled or fired â€” most notably Edward VIII, who had to renounce the throne and leave Britain to marry an American divorcÃ©e, and most recently Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth IIâ€™s second son, over his connections to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
True to the intense attention the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have attracted since their marriage in May 2018, the press was quickly filled with stories about their finances and prospects, and about how the queen, the princeâ€™s grandmother, would handle the defection.
A few articles actually showed sympathy for a couple trapped in a gilded cage that exposed them to constant scrutiny â€” and, in the duchessâ€™s case, virulent racism.
Sarcasm and exaggeration come easily when writing about royals, and the story of Prince Harry, the rambunctious second son of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, reaching across the Atlantic to marry an American actress was custom-made for the tabloids â€” and, yes, for serious papers like this one.
Their wedding at Windsor Castle and the birth of an adorable son, Archie, a year later was grand copy, a morality tale of a changing world, a fairy tale updated with diverse millennials.
But as the childrenâ€™s stories fail to warn unsuspecting youngsters, being royal isnâ€™t all about living happily, and certainly not ever after.
Almost from the outset, a parallel line of nasty stories spread in the tabloids about Meghanâ€™s difficulties with her American family and purported rifts among the royal family.
Instead of adopting the British tradition of a stiff upper lip in the face of adversity, as Queen Elizabeth has so admirably done throughout her long and crisis-riddled reign, Prince Harry and Meghan proclaimed that they did not intend to play by the old rules.
The prince, who lost his mother to a horrific car chase through Paris, spoke openly about his emotional struggles; the duchess made no secret of the difficulties of her new role.
â€œNot many people have asked if Iâ€™m O.K.,â€ she told one interviewer.
In October, the couple struck back, filing a lawsuit against The Mail on Sunday over the publication of a private letter from Meghan to her father.
In a statement explaining the suit, Prince Harry assailed the tabloids and the suffering they caused his wife.
â€œFor these select media this is a game, and one that we have been unwilling to play from the start,â€ he wrote.
â€œI have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long.
To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.â€  Given this background, the coupleâ€™s decision to withdraw from the Firm should not come as a surprise, though it appeared to be just that to the queen and the heir apparent, Prince Charles.
Reared in the tradition of monarchy as the symbol and mainstay of the nation, they have stoically carried on in their duties even as their world, and their family, has been battered by the winds of change, discontent and scandal, as dramatized in the Netflix series â€œThe Crown.â€ Evidently they expected the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to do just that, and to rear children who would as well.
But the real value of the royal family has never been in cutting ribbons and proving endless fodder for the tabloids; it has been in the continuing saga of fairy tale kings and queens coming to terms with the world.
In this story, Prince Harry and Meghan should not be lamented as defectors from the old order, but celebrated as the heroes of the next installment, as modern royals renouncing some level of privilege to seek their fortune in the real world.
May they live happily ever after.
How Much of Harvardâ€™s $40 Billion Endowment Is Invested in Fossil Fuels?
By Devi Lockwood Jan. 29, 2020  In my senior year at Harvard, I was invited to a dinner in honor of the writer Margaret Atwood, the recipient of the 2014 Harvard Arts Medal.
On my way out the door I lingered, shrugged on my coat, took a deep breath and walked up to the universityâ€™s president at the time, Drew Gilpin Faust.
We had met twice: once during her office hours and at an ice cream social.
â€œPlease divest from fossil fuels,â€ I said, hoping to catch her off guard.
The president, at first seemingly happy to see me, rearranged her face.
Her shoulders crept up toward her ears.
â€œYou students donâ€™t understand investments,â€ she said.
Then she walked out of the room.
I have benefited immeasurably from Harvardâ€™s investments in me.
But recognizing where some of Harvardâ€™s $40 billion endowment is invested was a cause of growing unease for me and some of my classmates.
Students at other campuses were similarly concerned about the endowments of their schools.
Figuring out exactly how much of Harvardâ€™s endowment is invested in oil, gas and coal companies is a near-impossible task.
Harvard is required to disclose only direct investments in which the university owns shares of a specific company.
Harvard says its direct investments amounted to $394 million as of May 2019, or roughly 1 percent of the endowment total.
Divest Harvard, a student group, determined that of that approximate amount, $5.6 million was invested in companies that produce or own reserves of oil, natural gas and coal, and large electric utilities powered by natural gas and coal.
Harvard doesnâ€™t comment on its individual investments.
But in 2015, the South Pole Group, a carbon finance consultant in Zurich, analyzed $989 million of Harvardâ€™s then $36.4 billion endowment at the request of Divest Harvard and 350.org.
Based on those investments, the group estimated that the overall endowment was responsible for annual emissions of 11 million tons of carbon dioxide, roughly equivalent to the annual emissions from Delaware.
Itâ€™s easy to get bogged down in the numbers, but the exact amount of Harvardâ€™s fossil fuel investments or the emissions it is responsible for isnâ€™t all that important.
As the world faces a climate crisis, any amount of investment in companies that extract or burn fossil fuels is too much, especially by one of the worldâ€™s leading universities.
Lawrence Bacow, the universityâ€™s current president, explained in the Harvard Gazette last fall that rather than divest, the university believes that â€œengaging with industry to confront the challenge of climate change is ultimately a sounder and more effective approach for our university.â€  But many students have not been content with that approach.
As part of a divestment campaign, in May 2014 an undergraduate, Brett Roche, was arrested by Harvard University police for blocking an entrance to Massachusetts Hall, where President Faust and members of the administration had their offices.
In April 2015, during Harvard Heat Week, students, faculty, alumni and community members blockaded President Faustâ€™s office once more.
Last November, at the Harvard-Yale football game, climate change protesters stormed the field at half time, delaying the game for roughly an hour.
To date, 532 faculty members have signed a petition in favor of divestment from fossil fuels.
The result?
Nothing has happened.
Other campuses have had more luck.
After pressure from student groups, Stanford announced in 2014 that it would not make direct investments in publicly traded companies whose principal business is coal mining.
The University of Maine followed suit in 2015, divesting all direct holdings from coal companies.
In 2017, Columbia University announced divestment from producers of coal burned to generate electricity.
Other schools have taken additional steps, divesting not only from coal producers, but also from oil and gas companies.
These include Sterling College in 2013; the University of Hawaii, University of Dayton, Syracuse University and the Rhode Island School of Design in 2015; and the University of Oregon in 2016.
The University of California system announced last September that it would divest $13 billion of its $83 billion endowment and $70 billion of pensions from fossil fuel producers.
Recognizing that student activism hasnâ€™t worked on its own, two Harvard College alumni from the class of 2018, Danielle Strasburger and NathÃ¡n Goldberg started thinking about the Harvard Board of Overseers election.
Last year, they founded Harvard Forward, an alumni-run organization that aims to elect five recently graduated candidates to the board.
The Board of Overseers mostly advises the university on strategic decisions, though it does have the power to consent to the election of members to the Harvard Corporation.
The average age of the five candidates is 28 â€” the same number of years that, on average, have passed since the current overseers were Harvard students.
Their platform includes: â€œComplete and swift divestment of all university assets from fossil fuels.â€  The board is composed of 30 Harvard alumni who sit for six-year terms.
Each year in April, five new members are voted in by alumni.
A nomination committee of the Harvard Alumni Association generally chooses eight candidates who will be added to the slate.
Thereâ€™s another way in, though â€” though a petition process.
To qualify, each candidate needs 2,936 signed nomination forms, equivalent to 1 percent of eligible voters (living Harvard alumni, with the exception of current professors, administrators and staff).
The first test will come on Feb. 1, the deadline to qualify for the ballot.
When we spoke last week, Ms. Strasburger estimated that between 2,300 and 2,400 nomination forms had already been signed in favor of each candidate.
They are nearly there.
This is not just about Harvard.
And itâ€™s also not just about whether you think divestment is a strategy that is worth pursuing, or whether it has an impact.
Rather, Harvard Forward is a model for building power by young people â€” of breaking the logjam within large institutions and making change happen.
This approach is not new.
From 1985 to 1991, Harvard and Radcliffe Alumni/ae Against Apartheid campaigned for Harvard to divest its stock in companies operating in South Africa.
The organization used the same nominate-by-petition system to elect four members to the board, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who stated that he would return his honorary degree unless Harvard divested entirely from South Africa.
By the 1980s, Harvard did.
Younger alumni realized then that they needed a seat at the decision making table to create change.
That is exactly what Harvard Forward is seeking.
On Jan. 15, Harvard Global Networking Night, over 100 volunteers for Harvard Forward â€” many of them alumni from the 1960s, â€™70s and â€™80s â€” attended 50 alumni events in 20 states and 20 countries with petitions in hand.
That night alone, they gathered over 1,000 signatures.
Alumni can submit petitions to nominate the younger slate of candidates until the deadline on Saturday at 5 p.m. Harvard Forward has volunteers in 35 cities to collect forms at signature parties this week.
â€œA lot of people want to know how they can make an impact when it comes to climate,â€ Ms. Strasburger told me.
â€œIf you have a chance to influence a $40 billion endowment, thatâ€™s a pretty big deal.â€ How to Avoid the Coronavirus?
Wash Your Hands By Elisabeth Rosenthal Jan. 28, 2020  Americans are watching with alarm as a new coronavirus spreads in China and cases pop up in the United States.
They are barraged with information about what kinds of masks are best to prevent viral spread.
Students are handing out masks in Seattle.
Masks have run out in Brazos County, Tex.
Hang on.
Iâ€™ve worked as an emergency room physician.
And as a New York Times correspondent in China, I covered the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003 during which a novel coronavirus first detected in Guangdong sickened more than 8,000 people and killed more than 800.
My two children attended elementary school in Beijing throughout the outbreak.
Here are my main takeaways from that experience for ordinary people on the ground:  1.
Wash your hands frequently.
2.
Donâ€™t go to the office when you are sick.
Donâ€™t send your kids to school or day care when they are ill, either.
Notice I didnâ€™t say anything about masks.
Having a mask with you as a precaution makes sense if you are in the midst of an outbreak, as I was when out reporting in the field during those months.
But wearing it constantly is another matter.
I donned a mask when visiting hospitals where SARS patients had been housed.
I wore it in the markets where wild animals that were the suspected source of the outbreak were being butchered, blood droplets flying.
I wore it in crowded enclosed spaces that I couldnâ€™t avoid, like airplanes and trains, as I traveled to cities involved in the outbreak, like Guangzhou and Hong Kong.
You never know if the guy coughing and sneezing two rows ahead of you is ill or just has an allergy.
But outdoors, infections donâ€™t spread well through the air.
Those photos of people walking down streets in China wearing masks are dramatic but uninformed.
And remember if a mask has, perchance, intercepted viruses that would have otherwise ended up in your body, then the mask is contaminated.
So, in theory, to be protected maybe you should use a new one for each outing.
The simple masks are better than nothing, but not all that effective, since they donâ€™t seal well.
For anyone tempted to go out and buy the gold standard, N95 respirators, note that they are uncomfortable.
Breathing is more work.
Itâ€™s hard to talk to people.
On one long flight at the height of the outbreak, on which my few fellow passengers were mostly epidemiologists trying to solve the SARS puzzle, many of us (including me) wore our masks for the first couple of hours on the flight.
Then the food and beverage carts came.
Though viruses spread through droplets in the air, a bigger worry to me was always transmission via what doctors call â€œfomites,â€ infected items.
A virus gets on a surface â€” a shoe or a doorknob or a tissue, for example.
You touch the surface and then next touch your face or rub your nose.
Itâ€™s a great way to acquire illness.
So after walking in the animal markets, I removed my shoes carefully and did not take them into the hotel room.
And of course I washed my hands immediately.
Remember, by all indications SARS, which killed about 10 percent of those infected, was a deadlier virus than the new coronavirus circulating now.
So keep things in perspective.
Faced with SARS, many foreigners chose to leave Beijing or at least to send their children back to the United States.
Our family stayed, kids included.
We wanted them with us and didnâ€™t want them to miss school, especially during what would be their final year in China.
But equally important in making the decision was that the risk of getting SARS on an airplane or in the airport seemed greater than being smart and careful while staying put in Beijing.
And we were: I stopped taking my kids to indoor playgrounds or crowded malls or delicious but densely packed neighborhood Beijing restaurants.
Out of an abundance of caution we canceled a family vacation to Cambodia â€” though my fear was less about catching SARS on the flight than that one of the kids would have a fever from an ear infection upon our return at a border screening, and would be stuck in a prolonged quarantine in China.
We instead took a vacation within China, where we carried masks with us but didnâ€™t use them except on a short domestic flight.
In time, during the SARS outbreak, the government shut down theaters and schools in Beijing, as it is doing now in many Chinese cities because these viruses are more easily transmitted in such crowded places.
But there was also a lot of irrational behavior: Entering a village on the way to a hike near the Great Wall, our car was stopped by locals who had set up a roadblock to check the temperature of all passengers.
They used an oral thermometer that was only minimally cleaned after each use.
What a great way to spread a virus.
The International School of Beijing, where my children were students, was one of the few in the capital â€” perhaps the only one â€” that stayed open throughout the SARS outbreak, though the classes were emptier, since so many kids had departed to their home countries.
It was a studied but brave move, since a parent at the school had gotten SARS at the very beginning of the outbreak on a flight back from Hong Kong.
She recovered fine, but it was close to home and families were scared.
The school instituted a bunch of simple precautionary policies: a stern note to parents reminding them not to send a child to school who was sick and warning them that students would be screened for fevers with ear thermometers at the school door.
There was no sharing of food at lunch.
The teacher led the kids in frequent hand washing throughout the day at classroom sinks, while singing a prolonged â€œhand washing songâ€ to ensure they did more than a cursory pass under the faucet with water only.
If a family left Beijing and came back, the child would have to stay at home for an extended period before returning to class to make sure they hadnâ€™t caught SARS elsewhere.
With those precautions in place, I observed something of a public health miracle: Not only did no child get SARS, but it seemed no student was sick with anything at all for months on end.
No stomach bugs.
No common colds.
Attendance was more or less perfect.
The World Health Organization declared the SARS outbreak contained in July 2003.
But, oh, that those habits persisted.
The best first-line defenses against SARS or the new coronavirus or most any virus at all are the ones that Grandma and common sense taught us, after all.
Inconvenient Murders By Bari Weiss  Two years ago, a 27-year-old man named Kobili TraorÃ© walked into the Paris apartment of a 65-year-old kindergarten teacher named Sarah Halimi.
Mr. TraorÃ© beat Ms. Halimi and stabbed her.
According to witnesses, he called her a demon and a dirty Jew.
He shouted, â€œAllahu akbar,â€ then threw Ms. Halimiâ€™s battered body out of her third-story apartment window.
This is what Mr. TraorÃ© told prosecutors: â€œI felt persecuted.
When I saw the Torah and a chandelier in her home I felt oppressed.
I saw her face transforming.â€  One would think that this would be an open-and-shut hate crime.
It was the coldblooded murder of a woman in her own home for the sin of being a Jew.
But French prosecutors decided to drop murder charges against Mr. TraorÃ© because he â€¦ had smoked cannabis.
If Franceâ€™s betrayal of Sarah Halimi is shocking to you, perhaps you havenâ€™t been paying much attention to what by now can be described as a moral calamity sweeping the West of which her story is only the clearest example.
A crisis, I hasten to add, thatâ€™s perhaps less known because it has been largely overlooked by the mainstream press.
The most generous read of this enormous blind spot is that the story is not always straightforward; there have been some laudable steps to fight back.
On Tuesday, for example, the French Parliament formally adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Allianceâ€™s definition of anti-Semitism when it passed a motion declaring anti-Zionism a form of Jew-hatred.
Yet on the same day, more than 100 Jewish gravestones were found spray-painted with swastikas in a cemetery near Strasbourg â€” a potent reminder that governments are only as good as the culture and the people upholding them.
So allow me to put it plainly: We are suffering from a widespread social health epidemic and it is rooted in the cheapening of Jewish blood.
If hatred of Jews can be justified as a misunderstanding or ignored as a mistake or played down as a slip of the tongue or waved away as â€œjust anti-Zionism,â€ you can all but guarantee it will be.
Yet beneath the finger-pointing and the victim-blaming and the accusations of panic lobbed against a people that know a little something about persecution, there is the same old bigotry â€” the hatred of Jews that has presaged the death of so many seemingly civilized societies.
A hatred that still, after centuries, exerts its powerful allure during periods of political and economic unrest, when the angry, the confused, the shortchanged and the scared look for simple explanations and a scapegoat.
And even those who seek to uplift the marginalized canâ€™t seem to find their voice when it comes to Jews facing anti-Semitism.
Take a look at some of the events around the Thanksgiving holiday, incidents that have kept Jews all over the world glued to their phones, and which have driven some to update their and their childrenâ€™s passports.
Start with Britain.
Last Friday night, a rabbi who had just left a synagogue was beaten on the street by teenagers screaming, â€œKill the Jews.â€ These now-regular occurrences come as thereâ€™s a decent chance that the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will become the next prime minister â€” giving anti-Semites the imprimatur of a major Western government.
Mr. Corbynâ€™s long history of slurs against Jews and Israel, his warm words about his â€œfriendsâ€ in Hezbollah, and his worldview, which finds far more to admire in countries like Russia and Venezuela than England itself, are well documented.
To choose just the latest headline: The BBC, he said on Iranian state television, is â€œbiasedâ€ toward saying that â€œIsrael has a right to exist.â€ (My favorite remains his remark that British Zionists â€œwho, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, donâ€™t understand English irony.â€)  The fish rots from the head, and so it has with Labour.
According to Britainâ€™s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, there are 130 cases of outstanding complaints of anti-Semitism against Labour Party members.
Ninety-three percent of British Jews say they wonâ€™t vote for Labour.
Forty-seven percent say they will â€œseriously considerâ€ emigrating if Labour wins.
And yet the latest polling shows Labour rallying.
Other issues, Jews are told, are more important than their own safety.
Sometimes their fears are dismissed as â€œhysteria.â€ The socialist filmmaker Ken Loach has called it a â€œwitch hunt.â€ The powerful union leader Len McCluskey has accused the Jewish community of â€œintransigent hostility.â€ When Rabbi Mirvis took the extraordinary step of weighing in on the election, insisting that the very â€œsoul of our nation is at stake,â€ he was accused, variously, of bad faith, of taking focus away from the real threat of right-wing bigotry, and of actually stoking anti-Semitism himself.
Jewish Voice for Labour, the partyâ€™s pet Jewish front group, has codified all of these gaslighting tactics in a document that helpfully lays out the strategy for how other political groups and movements with a will to power can shut down Jewish concerns about organized, systemic anti-Semitism.
Over in Italy, the town of Schio decided against establishing a Holocaust memorial â€” the subtle, brass â€œstumbling stonesâ€ called stolpersteine that dot the streets of European cities where survivors of Hitlerâ€™s genocide still stroll â€” on the grounds that 14 stones in a city of 40,000 would prove too divisive.
â€œLet the victims rest in peaceâ€ said Alberto Bertoldo, a local politician.
The memorial, he said, would risk â€œgenerating new hatred and division.â€  While in Schio the Holocaust proves a divisive moral issue, in Montreal it was a planned trip to Israel.
Jordyn Wright is a Jewish sophomore who sits on the board of the Studentsâ€™ Society of McGill University.
Over winter break, she is planning, like hundreds of other North American Jewish college students, to go to Israel with Hillel.
As a result of that trip, the student government voted to call for her resignation.
Never mind that the trip included time with Palestinians in the West Bank.
Never mind that another student government leader is also going; apparently because that student is not a Jew, no resignation was required.
I toggled over the weekend between Ms. Wrightâ€™s chilling account of the history of anti-Jewish discrimination at her school and The Washington Post, which had published a frothy profile of Valerie Plame, the former C.I.A.
officer who is now running for Congress as a Democrat in New Mexico.
There we learn that Ms. Plame looks â€œastoundingly good, at 56, as if the high-altitude desert air has preserved her skin since the day she arrived here 12 years ago.â€ Yet nowhere in the long article does the reader learn that two years ago, Ms. Plame tweeted an essay called â€œAmerican Jews Are Driving Americaâ€™s Warsâ€ by a man famous for his anti-Jewish conspiracy thinking on a website that flirts with Holocaust denial.
She also shared an article that linked Israel to the Sept. 11 attacks.
It somehow didnâ€™t merit mention.
Elsewhere in the Democratic Party, Linda Sarsour, the activist who was removed from her leadership position in the Womenâ€™s March thanks to her history of anti-Semitic scandals and who now serves as a surrogate for the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, gave a talk on Friday to a group called American Muslims for Palestine.
The part of her talk that circulated online focused on the apparent hypocrisy of progressive Zionists: How, Ms. Sarsour asked about people who are the No.
1 target of white supremacists, can they claim to oppose white supremacy when they support â€œa state like Israel that is built on supremacy, that is built on the idea that Jews are supreme to everybody else?â€  Lest you think this is â€œjust anti-Zionism,â€ consider that the Sanders surrogate was speaking at a conference that printed the following sentence in its program: â€œZionism has come in like a disease to destroy the purity of Al Quds.â€ (Al Quds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem.)
Should I tell you about a Christian fundamentalist show on TruNews hosted by a man named Rick Wiles?
TruNews was granted an interview by Donald Trump Jr. and its representative was called on by President Trump at a news conference.
Last week on his show Mr. Wiles claimed that Jews are behind the impeachment proceedings against the president.
A â€œJew coup,â€ he called it, that would replace Mr. Trump with â€œa Jewish cabal.â€  Should I tell you about the swastikas found at Sixth & I, a synagogue and a hub of Jewish cultural and intellectual life in Washington?
Or the ones painted in red on a statue of the great Yiddish writer Sholem Aleichem in Ukraine?
Or that on Monday morning in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, a Jewish subway rider reported that another woman yelled slurs and threatened to throw her onto the tracks?
And that the following day, also in Crown Heights, three teenagers hurled rocks at a Jewish elementary school bus, breaking a window.
There is a theme here.
The theme is that Jew-hatred is surging and yet Jewish victimhood does not command attention or inspire popular outrage.
That unless Jews are murdered by neo-Nazis, the one group everyone of conscience recognizes as evil, Jewsâ€™ inconvenient murders, their beatings, their discrimination, the singling out of their state for demonization will be explained away.
When you look at each of these incidents, perhaps it is possible still to pretend that these are random bursts of bigotry perpetrated by hooligans lacking any real organization or power behind them.
But Mr. Corbynâ€™s electoral prospects in Britain tell a different, far more distressing story â€” that a person with some of the same impulses as those hooligans can stand within spitting distance of the office of prime minister.
This is what happens when a culture decides that Jewish lives are stumbling stones.
Instead of a Generational Culture War, Letâ€™s Fight the Rich By Farhad Manjoo Nov. 6, 2019  Generations are pretty bogus.
The labels we use to casually slice up society â€” boomer, millennial, Gen X, Gen Z â€” are a nearly useless way of thinking about politics, culture or business in America.
The very idea that tens of millions of people across different classes and races and geographies might hold similar views on a range of subjects just because they happened to be born during the same 20-year span of American history â€” the whole thing sounds a bit too much like astrology, doesnâ€™t it?
In fact, demographers, whose profession came up with these labels, constantly stress the limitations and complications of generational analysis.
Generations can be useful for observing broad-scale changes in attitudes over long periods of time, but they break down into clichÃ©s and stereotypes when they are used to make specific observations about the world.
Marketers and much of the media tend to be quite careless in how we wield generational labels.
We invest these categories with too much meaning, often ascribing to generational ideology what is more likely a product of age, wealth and a variety of other factors.
Consider, for instance, the absurd parade of stories about how millennials are â€œkillingâ€ various industries, from golf to wedding rings.
They collectively paint young people as being somehow philosophically deficient as consumers rather than simply not very wealthy.
Of course, I would dismiss generations: Iâ€™m a Gen Xer, and our whole thing is rejecting labels.
On the other hand, I might be a boomer, because lately Iâ€™ve been nursing a crazy conspiracy theory about generational analysis: I think itâ€™s a plot by The Man to keep us from changing the world.
Focusing on generational differences distracts the masses from going after more salient differences in society â€” especially the power held by the wealthy, whatever their age.
All of this explains why Iâ€™m not really O.K.
with â€œok boomer,â€ the latest rallying cry in the permanent war between the Young and the Old.
As Taylor Lorenz reported in The Times last week, â€œok boomerâ€ is a meme started by teenagers to shred older people who express a broad range of antiquated ideas about the world.
(The grammar snoot in me â€” and my copy editor â€” would prefer the meme rendered as â€œO.K., boomer,â€ with periods and a comma, but of course thatâ€™s not how teenagers write.)
At first glance, the phrase â€” which, since Lorenzâ€™s report, has been co-opted and repeated into cringing ubiquity by just about every other generation â€” is the perfect response to your racist grandpa on Facebook and your liberal uncle on Wall Street who is very worried about Medicare for All.
Itâ€™s knowing, cutting, dismissive and almost impossible to gracefully recover from: â€œok boomerâ€ and youâ€™re done.
At the risk of sounding like a patronizing Old, Iâ€™ll concede that â€œok boomerâ€ means well, and I donâ€™t begrudge teenagers their anger.
They are certainly right that over several generations and across political ideologies, the holders of political and economic power in America totally screwed things up for the future.
Boomer leaders (and their forebears) underinvested in long-term infrastructure and safety nets and economic and environmental rules.
They overindulged in wars and tax cuts and systemic deregulation.
They long overlooked racial and gender bias, sexual harassment and just about every other form of systemic discrimination.
They brought the country and the world to the sorry place weâ€™re in now.
Yet itâ€™s a mistake to blame all boomers for the sins of the most powerful among them.
As a taunt, â€œok boomerâ€ overlooks the vast differences within the postwar generation â€” there are rich boomers and poor boomers, far-left boomers and far-right ones, boomers who are fighting for right and those who are hopelessly stuck in yesteryear.
â€œok boomerâ€ also lets other generations off the hook, neglecting the facts that millennials keep gaining greater economic and political power and that some of them are starting to act and sound like archetypal boomers.
Teenagers themselves seem to recognize this â€” â€œboomer is state of mind,â€ Lorenz writes of how the young think of the term.
On the phone, she pointed to further evidence of the flexibility of â€œboomerâ€ as a taunt.
On Twitter, she notes, Pete Buttigieg, the youngest of the 2020 Democratic candidates, is frequently dismissed as radiating big boomer energy.
Even though heâ€™s a millennial, thereâ€™s something about his rhetorical style that feels antiquated.
And Buttigiegâ€™s boomerish-ness only underlines the hollowness of the whole idea of generational stereotyping.
It suggests a more profitable political path for young people: Instead of canceling an entire generation, why not set your sights on a smaller, more specific group, one that bears more direct complicity in Americaâ€™s widening dystopia?
Not to go full Chapo Trap House on you, but yes, Iâ€™m talking about the wealthy.
Instead of â€œok boomer,â€ how about â€œok billionaireâ€?
Iâ€™ve been preoccupied with billionaires for much of the year.
In February, I argued that we should â€œabolishâ€ billionaires and wannabe billionaires because they exert outsize control over Americaâ€™s resources.
Insofar as they highlight the unforgivable ways that wealthy people have rigged the political system, billionaires are both a convenient and an appropriate political target of the moment.
On just about any important issue of the day, from climate change to mass incarceration to defeating Donald Trump, meaningful political change will come about only through cross-generational coordination â€” it will require concerned people of all ages to band together to alter the status quo.
One reason this is difficult in America is weâ€™ve been conditioned to think that people who are much older or younger than we are might be completely alien beings: Every millennial is an avocado-eating virtue signaler who wonâ€™t listen to opposing views; all boomers are white, affluent, selfish racists who canâ€™t recognize their privilege; and the two sides will never see eye to eye on anything.
But that is plainly false.
Last month, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whoâ€™s 30, endorsed 78-year-old Bernie Sanders for president â€” not despite his age, but because Sandersâ€™s â€œdecades of workâ€ on progressive causes was a sign of his fidelity to the movement.
In the summer, Ocasio-Cortez met Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist who has scolded older people for ignoring the issue.
Among other things, the pair discussed how age was simply a mind-set.
â€œYou can be much older and still part of a youth movement if you refuse to do things just because thatâ€™s the way theyâ€™ve always been done,â€ Ocasio-Cortez told Thunberg.
This is the sort of coalition we need to build a better future â€” not Gen Z fighting boomers, but a coalition of 16-year-olds and 30-year-olds and 78-year-olds joining together to demolish the rich who run the world today.
The stakes are too great; we canâ€™t afford to have any generation sit this one out.
Are There Limits to the Rights Revolution?
By Thomas B. Edsall Dec. 18, 2019  If youâ€™re a Democratic strategist, what do you do to reconcile the moral power of your partyâ€™s arguments about the inherent dignity and civil rights of every American with the reality of an electorate that has not caught up with where the party has gone and is slightly â€” or more than slightly â€” averse to it?
How do you decide whether what is right is also what is wise?
As recently as 2004, proposed state constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage, particularly one in Ohio, may have cost the Democrats the presidency, so how do you handle President Trumpâ€™s calculated assault on transgender rights?
You canâ€™t tell people â€œoh just wait for your rights, theyâ€™ll be coming soonâ€ â€” that has never worked for anyone â€” so I decided to ask philosophers, ethicists, transgender activists and others how the party should respond to Trumpâ€™s provocations.
The issues of political strategy raised by the transgender rights movement have split liberals into two camps, one urging caution against moving too far in front of public opinion, the other calling for all out support of transgender men and women.
On one side are Democrats for whom the first priority is a strategy to defeat Donald Trump in November and who see some policies sought by transgender rights activists as potentially alienating the moderate voters they believe are necessary to a Democratic victory.
On the other side are those who are equally hungry to see the president defeated but who hold a deep allegiance to the ethical and moral principles of freedom and equality, including for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender community.
Without these principles, they believe, the Democratic Party will not only lose votes, but also its core reason for being.
President Trump, ever the opportunist, has been aggressively moving since his inauguration to attack the rights of transgender men and women â€” seeing a hot button or third rail issue he thinks he can deploy to his advantage as he attempts to carve up the Democratic opposition.
I asked scholars who specialize in the study of moral dilemmas about the ethical and strategic choices Trumpâ€™s current offensive against transgender rights forces on the liberal coalition.
There is evidence that the Democratic response to Trumpâ€™s onslaught is split.
Peter Singer, a professor of bioethics at the Centre for Human Values at Princeton, has been described as â€œarguably the most famous and influential modern philosopher.â€ He is unequivocally committed to a liberal worldview.
â€œThe failure of people in the rich nations to make any significant sacrifices in order to assist people who are dying from poverty-related causes is ethically indefensible,â€ he wrote in â€œAchieving the Best Outcome,â€ a 2002 essay: It is not simply the absence of charity, let alone of moral saintliness: It is wrong, and one cannot claim to be a morally decent person unless one is doing far more than the typical comfortably-off person does.
Singer is specifically sympathetic to the difficulties facing transgender men and women, writing in 2012 â€œPeople who cross gender boundaries suffer clear discrimination.â€  Weighing the tactical options facing Democrats, Singer was, nonetheless, forceful in his response to my emailed inquiry: As a consequentialist, I donâ€™t believe that the party is obligated to support discriminated against groups regardless of the consequences.
After all, the re-election of Trump, and Republican control of Congress, would be a greater disaster than the rejection of the legitimate claims of transgender people to express themselves as they wish.
Most importantly, Singer continued, the re-election of Trump would mean another four years in which the U.S. does little or nothing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, which makes it difficult for other leaders to take the strong stand that is needed, and that could bring about changes that are catastrophic for hundreds of millions or even billions of people.
The harm that a second Trump term would produce, Singer argued, â€œputs the transgender issues you mention in perspective.
We may believe that people should be able to use whichever bathroom they choose, but standing up for that isnâ€™t sufficient reason to risk the future of our planet,â€ not to mention â€œthe many other waysâ€ that a â€œTrump/Republican victory would be bad.â€  Taking a different position, Amie L. Thomasson, professor of intellectual and moral philosophy at Dartmouth, wrote by email: I think that however much Democrats may want to win, we must not lose sight of our moral compass â€” especially in times like this.
The commitment to protecting the rights, equality, and well-being of everyone â€” not just those with power, wealth, or privilege â€” is absolutely central.
This commitment is not subject to compromise: the Democratic Party, Thomasson argued, would lose its soul to lose those commitments.
What we need most in this country is an honest moral conversation â€” and that means not replacing moral considerations with strategic calculations, or burying them to meet short-term goals.
Moral commitments, Thomasson continued, are not things that should be sacrificed in hopes of avoiding right-wing attacks, or hoping to maximize a calculation of expected votes.
It does, of course, leave Democrats with a job to do, of making clear that it is moral rights, human rights that are at stake here; of making clear why recognizing transgender rights is not a threat; and of working through the details of policy proposals regarding the impact on health care, etc.
In fact, Mara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, does not expect Democratic presidential candidates to support every priority set by her organization.
In a phone interview, Keisling said that her organizationâ€™s first priority is that the candidates â€œshow they are compassionate people who care about marginalized people.â€  She said that if a Democrat wins the presidency, â€œwe will have a policy agenda of maybe 200 items,â€ but her group would not expect full support on every one of them.
The center has been interviewing Democratic candidates and so far all of them have shown that â€œthey think about trans people in a compassionate way.
Thatâ€™s a lot,â€ she said, and a sharp contrast to Trump.
I asked Grace Lavery, a professor of English at Berkeley â€” who describes her work in trans-feminist studies as â€œfocused on the belief that transition works; that it is truly possible to change sexâ€ â€” a series of questions, including: â€œHow do you think Democrats should deal with some of the more complex issues raised by the transgender rights movement?â€  She replied: The same way that anyone else should: by discussing them openly, and ensuring that trans peopleâ€™s accounts of our own experiences are being heard.
Trans people, Lavery continued, need access to health care, we need equitable treatment by a criminal justice system, and we need equal protection under existing civil rights/Title IX legislation.
Given which, we donâ€™t tend to care what cis people think about what transness means.
The basic issue, Lavery argued, is about safeguarding the civil rights of a minority of people, at a moment in history when we are being singled out for prejudicial treatment.
There are no real policy issues to address other than prejudice and squeamishness.
Robin Dembroff, a professor of philosophy at Yale who uses the pronouns they/them, wrote me that Democratic candidates should treat â€œthe Trump campaignâ€™s focus on transgender issuesâ€ as a â€œdivisive tool for stoking fear, distracting from economic, health care, and climate issues, and dismantling already tenuous womenâ€™s rights.â€  Dembroff argued that â€œrecent threats to reproductive rights, LGBTQ workplace protections, and transgender health care and facility access within the U.S. are part of this global movement to maintain the gendered status quo.â€  Trump has clearly calculated that opposition to transgender rights will win him more votes than it will lose him, and he has translated that decision into action throughout the executive branch, rescinding a wide range of pro-transgender regulations, while issuing harsh new ones.
While some of his decisions have been temporarily blocked by the courts, his intentions are clear.
Trump has barred transgender individuals from serving in the military.
He has withdrawn an Obama administration regulation granting transgender students the right to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity.
He has expanded a â€œconscience ruleâ€ that protects doctors and other health care workers who, on religious grounds, decline to provide care and who refuse to refer patients to personnel who will provide it.
The administration has also proposed the elimination of Obama-era rules banning discrimination against transgender medical patients by eliminating provisions that define discrimination â€œon the basis of sexâ€ to include gender identity.
For over five decades, starting with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Democratic Party has assumed the broad role of political home to the rights revolution for African-Americans, Latinos, women, gays and, now, transgender men and women.
The general election will test whether the Democratic nominee is willing â€” in the face of Trumpâ€™s inflammatory forays against transgender rights â€” to bear the potential costs of fighting for private health care coverage of gender transition surgery, including for those in the armed services, in prison, or on Medicaid; participation in womenâ€™s athletic competition for transgender women; and nondiscriminatory access to public facilities, including bathrooms in schools, libraries and public spaces.
For David Leege, a professor emeritus of political science at Notre Dame, the issue of transgender rights now poses a possibly insoluble dilemma for Democrats â€” something Trump fully intends to exploit.
Leege wrote me: I think it is an area whose discourse is so new that a politically feasible solution has not yet presented itself.
If we canâ€™t yet deal with toilets, where the answers are simple â€” unisex toilet compartments with locks on doors â€” how can we deal with large public financial outlays for sex-change surgery?
Leege said he can foresee â€œpoliticiansâ€™ appeals to relative deprivation.
â€˜Weâ€™re going to spend taxpayersâ€™ dollars for their sex-change surgeries when there is not enough to pay for my cancer drugsâ€™.â€  As an example of the complexities of transgender rights, Leege cited the questions raised by the issue of whether transgender women should be able to enter womenâ€™s sports competitions: Should she be forced to compete with men in running events or basketball rather than against women?
What is fair to other women?
To the transgender woman?
Are rights in conflict?
Is kindness violated?
We donâ€™t walk around with labels specifying levels of male and female hormones.
And we have thought of gender in binary terms for so long that it is hard to think that hormones could resemble bell-shaped curves.
There are clear philosophical differences over Democratsâ€™ obligations to the transgender community.
These differences translate, in turn, to sharply dissimilar strategies for how Democrats should address transgender issues.
Bruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, worries that Democrats risk not only mobilizing Trump supporters, but also losing votes from their own constituents.
â€œTransgender rights,â€ Cain writes, â€œcould indeed become a powerful wedge issue for President Trump, especially if the Democrats across the board take the strongest pro-transgender rights stances.â€  Cain noted that stands in favor of â€œusing public money to pay for sexual transition or allowing transgender access to public facilities will certainly fire up the conservative, Republican base,â€ but, he continued, â€œI would worry especially about the reaction in the black and Latino communities and among older moderate whites.â€  The key to the 2020 election, in Cainâ€™s view, â€œis winning back states behind the blue wall and the swing states, keeping the focus on Trump and away from bolder issues that might lose votes in the swing areas.â€  In contrast to Cain, Seana Shiffrin, a professor of philosophy, law and social justice at U.C.L.A., argued that the Democrats should take a matter of fact approach about these issues, with the tone that they are pretty straightforward.
They shouldnâ€™t hand-wring or talk about it as â€œa difficult matter,â€  In Shiffrinâ€™s view, â€œshowing strength and conviction here is also a strategic approach.â€  She provided more specific examples of how Democrats could frame transgender issues: Democrats are in favor of health care for all and so they are in favor of what transgender people require to function and flourish, just as they are in favor of the health care that any other member of society needs to function and flourish.
We all have different health needs.
Some of the health needs of transgender people have been neglected and the costs they have suffered as a result are rather shocking.
In the case of bathrooms, Shiffrin argued that the issue should be placed in the larger context of protecting people from violence: The people in true danger of violence in restrooms are transgender people who do not conform to gender expectations.
Forcing transgender women to use menâ€™s rooms will subject them to potential violence.
Ergo, we should allow people to choose the restroom that best fits their identity and comfort levels.
Nancy Bauer, a professor of philosophy and a dean of academic affairs for Arts and Sciences at Tufts, argues in favor of orienting strategy toward younger voters: My view is that the only way that Democrats can win is if they embrace progressivism, not just because itâ€™s on the side of justice, equality, fairness, compassion, and decency, but also because itâ€™s the only political strategy that will bring younger voters to the polls in significant numbers.
I think that Trump is monstrous and deeply fear his re-election.
But the best way to get rid of him is to build coalitions of decent people and get out the vote.
Judith Butler, a professor of comparative literature at Berkeley whose books include â€œGender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity,â€ made a straightforward case for full support of transgender policy priorities: We are seeking to win the election in order to restore faith in democracy, which includes a commitment to equality and freedom.
We do not seek to win for the sake of winning, but in order to preserve principles such as equality embodied in civil rights protections.
The right to health care and to social recognition and protection from discrimination should be regarded as the fundamental rights of trans people in society.
If we deny those rights, including the right to have access to medical care, we deny those rights and treat trans people differently from other minorities under the law.
William Galston, a senior fellow at Brookings and former deputy assistant to President Bill Clinton for domestic policy, makes a different argument, in favor of more incremental change: The task of decent politicians in a democracy is to move their country as far toward justice and fairness as the current state of public opinion will permit while doing what they can to improve the chances that public opinion will continue to shift in the right direction.
This task requires judgment based on a solid understanding of public opinion and of the facts on the ground.
This is not an easy task, especially for a political party that supports challenges to the traditional hierarchy.
Galston went on: As an elected official or aspirant for elective office, there is nothing dishonorable about defining oneâ€™s policy aspirations at any given point in response to what the public is prepared to endorse or at least permit at that time.
The higher the stakes in the election, the more defensible this practice becomes.
If, as many people believe, the 2020 election implicates not only policy disputes but also the future of liberal constitutional democracy in the United States, then it would be justified to subordinate any policy issue to the overriding goal of protecting our constitutional order.
Transgender rights pose a classic push-pull problem for the contemporary Democratic Party: in supporting the expansion of rights to previously discriminated-against constituencies, how far ahead of public opinion should the party go?
The difficulty is only made more challenging by the fact that the pressure in primaries is to move to the left while the pressure in the general election is to move to the center.
By a number of measures, the country has become markedly more liberal over the past half century, especially on social and cultural issues â€” even as the process has been slow, often painstakingly slow, the pace more evolutionary than abrupt â€” as the public becomes acclimated to change.
Would Democrats be wise to recognize this pace of change as they head into a defining election?
Or should they attempt to enlarge their base by embracing an elemental argument about what the party stands for?
This is an election in which turnout will be crucial.
Can Democrats spur the legions who are focused on the environment, climate change, immigration and womenâ€™s rights as well as transgender rights?
Can they expand the arenas of concern?
The stakes could not be higher.
Is Pete Buttigieg Just Too Young to Be President?
By Frank Bruni Dec. 14, 2019  Finland just elected the worldâ€™s youngest prime minister, Sanna Marin, whoâ€™s 34.
Time magazine named Greta Thunberg, 16, its youngest-ever â€œPerson of the Year.â€  Even before I could mention their names to Pete Buttigieg, whoâ€™s vying to become the youngest American president, he brought them up.
He also brought up Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, who was 37 when she took office, and Emmanuel Macron, who became the president of France at 39.
Thatâ€™s how old Buttigieg, now 37, would be at his inauguration.
â€œYouâ€™re seeing a generation of leaders around the world emerging, and it feels like the kind of thing that the U.S. would be on the forefront of, just because weâ€™re a country that values a look to the future,â€ he told me in an interview on Thursday morning.
â€œI think itâ€™s our style.â€  â€œThis country was founded by 20-somethings,â€ he added, referring to the fact that Aaron Burr, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, for example, were in their 20s on July 4, 1776.
Thomas Jefferson was 33.
John Hancock was 39.
Donald Trump is 73, meaning that he has more than a half-century of life lessons on some of them.
How does that show?
Well, an hour before I connected with Buttigieg, the president saw fit to tweet that Timeâ€™s choice of Thunberg, a Swedish climate-change activist, was â€œso ridiculousâ€ and that she should â€œwork on her Anger Management problem.â€ Facing imminent impeachment, he started a Twitter spat with a teenage girl.
Trump is the â€œmost extreme example of the fact that while wisdom and age may be related, theyâ€™re very much not the same thing,â€ Buttigieg said.
Still.
Age isnâ€™t irrelevant.
America is much, much bigger than Finland and much, much more complicated than it was during the Revolutionary War.
In a country so powerful, at such a perilous time, is Buttigieg simply too young and too green to lead the way?
Itâ€™s the question that hovers over a presidential campaign whose success has stunned the political world.
It predates concerns about his  work as a consultant with McKinsey or his trouble building support among African-Americans.
It suggests an intensity of ambition and a presumptuousness that make his detractors bristle.
And even now, after first-place finishes in some recent polls of Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire, heâ€™s pressed about whether someone with his short rÃ©sumÃ©, capped by two terms as the mayor of a city of just 100,000 people, could possibly be up to the presidency and pass muster with enough Americans to get elected.
He told me that voters and journalists ask him about his age more often than they do about his sexual orientation.
(If elected, heâ€™d be the first openly gay president.)
So we spent most of a nearly hourlong car ride between campaign stops in the New York City area talking about it.
He conceded that the longer youâ€™re alive, â€œthe more you learn,â€ and that there are lessons and life passages still in the offing for him.
Heâ€™d like to be a parent, but if he succeeds on his current quest, heâ€™d become the leader of the free world first.
â€œA lot of things in my life have been out of sequence,â€ he said.
â€œI was a mayor before I got married.
I was a war veteran before I had dated.â€ He was referring to his seven months in Afghanistan and recognizing that while he has been precociously ahead of the game in many regards, he was behind in others.
It was only four years ago, at 33, that he finally had a serious romantic relationship â€” with the man, Chasten, who is now his husband.
Age has played out in surprising ways in the Democratic primary.
While Buttigieg is unusually young, the other three candidates grouped with him at the head of the pack â€” Joe Biden, 77; Elizabeth Warren, 70; and Bernie Sanders, 78 â€” are unusually old.
Sanders had a heart attack in October, and Bidenâ€™s energy has visibly dimmed, to a point where some of his aides and supporters have sought to reassure voters by whispering about the possibility that heâ€™d want to serve just one term.
The oldest candidate, Sanders, is by far the most popular among the youngest Democratic voters, getting the support of 52 percent of those between the ages of 18 and 34 in a national Quinnipiac poll released on Tuesday.
Buttigieg got just 2 percent of that group, in contrast with 12 percent of Democratic voters between 35 and 49, 12 percent of those between 50 and 64 and 11 percent of those 65 and older.
He attributed that to younger votersâ€™ attraction to Sandersâ€™s less pragmatic, more ideologically pure vision.
Itâ€™s certainly not because Buttigieg hasnâ€™t courted them.
In this â€œO.K.
Boomerâ€ moment of younger Americansâ€™ disgust with the income inequality, social injustices and climate change that older Americans have bequeathed them, he has claimed a generational perspective that separates him from his rivals for the Democratic nomination.
He notes that he was still in high school when the Columbine massacre happened; that he had just started college when the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred; and that heâ€™ll be living with Americaâ€™s failures longer than his older rivals will.
He also makes the case that people of Bidenâ€™s, Warrenâ€™s and Sandersâ€™s age have had their chance to fix things.
Shouldnâ€™t someone with an arguably fresher outlook â€” someone from outside Washington â€” take a turn?
With that reasoning he frames political vulnerabilities as political virtues.
â€œYou know the stat about three of the last four presidents emerging from the summer of 1946?â€ he asked, referring to Trumpâ€™s birth in June 1946, George W. Bushâ€™s in July of that year and Bill Clintonâ€™s in August.
â€œIt means that one generation has been in charge for a very long time.â€  But his youth is in some ways a bind that puts me in mind of the even greater predicament for female candidates.
Theyâ€™re expected to show that theyâ€™re as tough as men, but then that toughness is described as bossiness, shrillness.
Buttigieg has to muster extra poise, extra confidence, lest any deficit be interpreted as immaturity.
But then that poise and confidence, in the context of his age, are interpreted as arrogance.
His detractors constantly tell me that heâ€™s cocky â€” or robotic.
â€œOne of the things I get is, â€˜Why arenâ€™t you more passionate?â€™â€ he said.
â€œIâ€™m very passionate.
But Iâ€™m also very disciplined.
If I werenâ€™t, it would be harder to be taken seriously.â€  Is he maybe too disciplined?
Too contained?
Wondering if heâ€™d yet confronted the responsibility of helping to care for a sick parent, I asked about his own parents, and learned only then that his father died last January.
While Iâ€™d kept reasonably close tabs on Buttigiegâ€™s candidacy, this was something that he hadnâ€™t mentioned enough that Iâ€™d heard it.
And he said relatively little about it during our chat.
The Constitution decrees that a House member must be at least 25, a senator at least 30, a president at least 35.
No American president has been under 40, and only two took office before the age of 45: Teddy Roosevelt, who was 42, and John F. Kennedy, who was 43.
Shouldnâ€™t and doesnâ€™t that give Buttigieg pause?
â€œOf course you have those moments,â€ he acknowledged.
â€œWeâ€™re talking about a role of unbelievable importance and complexity and challenge.
And yet every person whoâ€™s done it has been a mortal, a human being â€” and of course so much depends not just on the individual but on how you build a team.â€  â€œThe audacity of proposing to do it at a young age is nowhere near the audacity of proposing to do it at all,â€ he said.
So age â€œbecomes like a detail.â€  He repeated something that he has said scores if not hundreds of times on the campaign trail: As mayor of South Bend, Ind., for the past eight years, he has had a kind of executive experience that someone who has served in Congress for that long or longer hasnâ€™t.
Besides, he said, experience isnâ€™t the only font of wisdom.
Education matters.
Intuition, too.
He comes armed with historical examples beyond the founders of people who made remarkable contributions early on.
â€œIâ€™m not going to compare myself to Martin Luther King,â€ he said, â€œbut heâ€™s certainly an example of somebody who had a huge impact, mainly in his 30s.â€ King died at 39.
Buttigieg noted that Stephen Biko, one of the most prominent anti-apartheid activists in South Africa in the 1970s, died at 30.
Trump has mockingly referred to Buttigieg as Alfred E. Neuman, the gaptoothed, big-eared, boyish mascot for Mad magazine.
He did so at a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, asking his audience, â€œCan you believe heâ€™s doing well?â€  â€œI dream about him,â€ Trump added.
â€œItâ€™s true.â€  Buttigiegâ€™s response?
â€œI donâ€™t want to be anywhere near that guyâ€™s dreams,â€ he told me.
Itâ€™s a good answer.
Maybe heâ€™d match up well against Trump.
Iâ€™m not sure, and how I wish I were, because the likeliest Trump slayer is the Democratic nominee I want and America needs.
Both substantively and in terms of electability, Buttigieg would be better off if he were older, with higher positions under his belt, but then all of the leading Democrats have worrying shortcomings.
His youth is a concern.
It shouldnâ€™t be a deal-breaker.
Jared Kushner Fails Up, Again By Frank Bruni Nov. 26, 2019  Jared Kushner just got a promotion.
Another one.
At least I think we can call it that, and itâ€™s a deliciously perfect assignment.
The pallid princeling is now responsible for speeding construction of the border wall.
In other words, a make-believe fixer will oversee a fairy-tale fix.
Josh Dawsey and Nick Miroff of The Washington Post broke the news, and when I read it, I realized that I hadnâ€™t heard much about Jared â€” or, for that matter, Ivanka â€” in a good long while.
Theyâ€™re front and center when the administration is announcing some ostensibly sensible initiative or claiming a pittance of progress.
But when its corruption is being exposed and the drizzle of subpoenas becomes a downpour, they vanish, cuddling for warmth under the gilded umbrella of their hallucinatory virtue.
We can pretty much chart the weather of the administration by the relative visibility of Donald Jr., so loud and hirsute, and Jared, so smooth-cheeked and mute.
Donald Jr. thrives when itâ€™s nastiest, stomping gleefully through the muck.
Jared comes out only if his suit wonâ€™t get dirty or his hair wet.
During the impeachment inquiry, weâ€™ve seen a lot of Donald Jr. Thatâ€™s partly because he has been hawking his new book, copies of which the Republican National Committee spent nearly $100,000 on.
But itâ€™s also because heâ€™s such a ready, eager conduit for his fatherâ€™s wrath, with a talent for exaggeration and misdirection thatâ€™s clearly chromosomal.

But itâ€™s also because heâ€™s such a ready, eager conduit for his fatherâ€™s wrath, with a talent for exaggeration and misdirection thatâ€™s clearly chromosomal.
Jared and Ivanka have been strategically scarce, though Ivanka did flutter into view, in a fashion, when President Trump boasted two weeks ago that she had created 14 million jobs since the inauguration.
â€œFourteen million and going up!â€ he clarified, lest anyone get the misimpression that she thought her work was done.
Never!
On behalf of the American people, Ivanka is tireless.
Thereâ€™s no rest for the weary, and thereâ€™s even less of it for those who live at the crossroads of self-infatuation and delusion.
In an interview last month on Fox Business, Ivanka said that she and Dad were â€œfighting every day for the American workerâ€ and that she was determined to â€œdrive hard every single day to make an impact.â€  â€œYour time and service â€” our time here â€” is finite,â€ she mused, and while Iâ€™d love to believe that she was prophesying her and her fatherâ€™s imminent eviction from the White House, I think she was referring, in her deeply spiritual way, to the span of a human life.
â€œItâ€™s sand through an hourglass.â€ As Ivanka serves us, she never forgets the sand.
Democrats believe that the Trump administrationâ€™s void of ethics will sour American voters on the president.
But those voters are likelier to abandon him for the administrationâ€™s vacuum of competence â€” for his nonsensical managerial style, captured in his magical thinking about Jared.
He tasked Jared with reinventing the federal government.
Unless constant rash firings, unfilled jobs and shakedowns of foreign governments constitute reinvention, this remains on Jaredâ€™s infinite to-do list.
The president put Jared in charge of brokering a durable peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
Insert punch line here.
He followed Jaredâ€™s counsel that faith be placed in Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.
We know how that worked out.
The president somehow looked at that track record and decided that the dynamo he should entrust with his central campaign promise â€” a secure barrier between the United States and Mexico â€” was â€¦ Jared!
And so we have the trillionth gorgeous example of his investment in fiction.
Nearly three years into Trumpâ€™s presidency, the border wall barely exists.
Subtract the upgrading of fencing and such that was already there and Trump has, by some recent estimates, constructed fewer than 25 miles of actually new barrier.
The southwestern border is nearly 2,000 miles long.
But Jared is on the case!
According to The Post, he â€œconvenes biweekly meetings in the West Wing, where he questions an array of government officials about progressâ€ and â€œexplains the presidentâ€™s wishes.â€ Huh.
Those wishes are hardly cryptic, and how complicated can this questioning be?
Already, The Post reported, thereâ€™s grumbling that Jared is just an annoyance.
That belittles his symbolic significance.
Many journalists, including me, have tried to settle on the perfect mascot for the Trump administration.
There are choices galore.
The greedy, vainglorious Scott Pruitt, who did his best to decimate the Environmental Protection Agency, fit the bill, but heâ€™s long gone.
Mike Pompeo embodies the Faustian arc of so many of the presidentâ€™s aides and allies, from principle-driven dismissal of Trump during the 2016 campaign to reputation-torching submission when he dangled a ticket to the big time.
But for naked opportunism and situational scruples, Jaredâ€™s my guy.
Remember how he and Ivanka were going to contain the presidentâ€™s ego, blunt his cruelty, whisper sweet moderation in his ear?
That was then.
Now heâ€™s devoting himself to an exorbitant, unnecessary monument to Trumpâ€™s nativism and xenophobia.
Thereâ€™s an upside, though.
With Jared in the saddle, this horse wonâ€™t go far.
Jeff Bezosâ€™ Phone Hack Should Terrify Everyone By Charlie Warzel Jan. 24, 2020  If the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, wants to chat on WhatsApp, politely decline.
Thatâ€™s the lesson from a series of reports this week based off a forensic examination of Jeff Bezosâ€™ communications with the crown prince.
The investigation â€” conducted at Mr. Bezosâ€™ request by FTI Consulting â€” found that his phone had most likely been attacked in 2018 after he received a WhatsApp message from the princeâ€™s personal account.
While my colleagues in the Times newsroom have pieced together details of the investigation, thereâ€™s still a great deal unknown.
And cybersecurity experts have serious questions about FTIâ€™s report, which, according to CyberScoop, â€œhas not impressed the information security community.â€  Still, the story seems to have everything: from lighthearted, embarrassingly earnest texts, â€œdivorced guyâ€ memes and world leaders who awkwardly sign their text messages with their full names to the deeply problematic issue of revenge porn and stealing of private nude photos.
Though itâ€™s a gilded example of digital theft, thereâ€™s something troubling and relatable about it all.
Billionaires, theyâ€™re just like us!
Or maybe not.
Looked at one way, the attack on Mr. Bezosâ€™ phone could be seen as yet more proof of what my colleague Kara Swisher called â€œthe death of privacy.â€ If the richest man in the world â€” the man who sells listening devices used in millions of homes and whose servers create the internetâ€™s infrastructure â€” can be hacked, what hope is there for us mere mortals?
Turns out, thereâ€™s some.
Yes, your personal privacy and security are constantly under threat.
And yes, you should be trying to safeguard against malware, phishing and bulk data collection.
But the Bezos attack is an example of extremely targeted surveillance, the potentially expensive and risky kind that is aimed at high-value targets like executives, government officials, celebrities and billionaires.
And as it turns out, many of those with the most to lose are woefully inept at safeguarding their privacy.
Not long after the Bezos news broke this week, I spoke to Christopher Pierson, who founded BlackCloak, a cybersecurity company for high-net-worth and high-profile individuals â€” executives, celebrities and billionaires.
According to Mr. Pierson, few people take their digital lives as seriously as they should.
â€œThe majority of clients we onboard come on in some kind of hacked state,â€ he told me.
â€œTheir computers are compromised or their login credentials are available on dark web.
Their home camera systems are accessible to people on internet or their entire home and appliances are vulnerable and viewable by persons remotely.â€ Mr. Pierson suggests thatâ€™s in part because high-value targets choose to focus on physical security over digital and invest in private bodyguards, camera systems and protections like kidnapping insurance.
How bad is it?
â€œWe see passwords in little black books on desks by the machines and in files on the computers.
We see passwords that are the same everywhere.
We absolutely do not see good use of dual factor authentication on email, health care and financial accounts.
Iâ€™d say we see less than 1 percent of high-net-worth individuals using dual factor.â€  Mr. Pierson said BlackCloak has found more than 82 percent of its clientsâ€™ current passwords on the dark web when it ran an initial search.
â€œIn the case of high-net-worth individuals, the same compromised password is frequently used by 20 to 40 different accounts â€” some of those are personal, some are in the office.â€  What Mr. Pierson describes is low-hanging fruit â€” the kind of security flaws that can quickly be fixed with a little knowledge and attention to detail.
Even then, he said, it takes time for the true nature of clientsâ€™ vulnerability to sink in.
â€œTheyâ€™re shocked when we give them their password and tell them where we found it, but it doesnâ€™t hit as hard as when we tell them their entire home automation system has been potentially online and viewable for three or five or eight years,â€ he said.
When it comes to a Bezos-style breach â€” potentially at the hands of a nation-stateâ€™s intelligence service â€” high-profile targets would most likely be even less prepared.
As Mr. Bezosâ€™ lengthy investigation into the 2018 attack shows, itâ€™s difficult to get straight answers even when you have the money and resources to run full forensics.
Of course, itâ€™s not just wealth that turns somebody into a person of interest for hackers.
Journalists, government employees, workers at energy companies and utilities could all be targets for someone.
Those who work for financial companies, airlines, hospitals, universities, Hollywood studios and tech businesses are all potentially at risk.
You can take steps to secure yourself from corporate data collection by using privacy settings on your phone.
And to protect yourself from cyberattacks there are helpful guides you can use that have been vetted by security professionals.
For most of us, the attack against Mr. Bezos isnâ€™t the death of privacy, but a reminder of the risks of living a connected life.
It should be a moment to think as critically about what you do online as you might in the real world.
Invest in a password manager.
Turn on dual factor authentication.
Be skeptical of any communication that looks out of place.
For the ultrarich and influential, the Bezos hack should be a terrifying revelation.
As the former State Department employee and whistle-blower John Napier Tye told me last autumn, â€œFor someone whoâ€™s truly a high-value target, there is no way to safely use a digital device.â€ The stakes are astronomically high.
Not just personally, as Mr. Bezos found, but professionally.
Company secrets, matters of national security, access to critical infrastructure and the safety of employees could all be compromised by lax security at the top.
The internet has long been thought of as a truly democratic tool, flattening and democratizing the ability to publish and communicate.
Itâ€™s also the great privacy equalizer.
Money can buy a lot of things.
But on a dangerous internet full of exploits, flawed code, shady actors and absent-minded humans, total, foolproof security is not one of them.
Joe Biden Is Stronger Than You Think By David Brooks Jan. 23, 2020  It was yet another epic failure of political punditry.
Go back to the early months of Joe Bidenâ€™s presidential campaign and read what the consultants and commentators were saying about him: His support is just name recognition; heâ€™ll fade!
Heâ€™s too old!
Heâ€™s running a zombie campaign!
The party has moved left and heâ€™s out of touch!
He voted for the crime bill!
Almost everybody was bearish on Joe.
But now look where we are, weeks from actual voting.
If the polls are to be believed, Biden will win Iowa, heâ€™ll come in second in New Hampshire, he will easily win Nevada, he will dominate in South Carolina.
Heâ€™s now tied for the lead in California and heâ€™s way ahead in Texas.
I donâ€™t know if heâ€™ll win the nomination (both he and Bernie Sanders look strong), but this is not where a lot of people six months ago thought weâ€™d be.
Itâ€™s the 947th consecutive sign that we in the coastal chattering classes have not cured our insularity problem.
Itâ€™s the 947th case in which we see that every second you spend on Twitter detracts from your knowledge of American politics, and that the only cure to this insularity disease is constant travel and interviewing, close attention to state and local data and raw abject humility about the fact that the attitudes and academic degrees that you think make you clever are actually the attitudes and academic degrees that separate you from the real texture of American life.
Biden didnâ€™t just luck into this.
He and his team grasped six truths:  Understand the year you are running in.
Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are running the same basic campaign they would have run in 2012 or 2016.
Bidenâ€™s campaign is completely focused on the central problem of 2020: that Donald Trump is a steaming hot mess in the middle of national life.
Biden has fixated his campaign on the Trump problem and fighting for the soul of America.
Nearly twice as many Democrats say itâ€™s more important to beat Trump than to have a candidate with whom they agree on all issues.
Understand your partyâ€™s core challenge.
All around the world parties on the left are losing because they have lost touch with the working class.
These parties think they can reconnect with that class by swinging even further left.
But Jeremy Corbyn in Britain and Bernie Sanders here are a doctoral studentâ€™s idea of a working-class candidate, not an actual working personâ€™s idea of one.
Biden has criticized his own party for losing touch with this class.
He emerged from it, is focusing his attention on it and is winning support from it.
Moderates are still powerful.
The Democratic Party is moving left, but about half of Democrats still say they are moderate or conservative.
No candidate has ever won a nomination without strong support from these voters, while college-town candidates â€” Howard Dean, Gary Hart â€” tend to falter.
In every presidential general election that Democrats have won since 1988, they carried moderates by more than 12 percentage points.
In every race they have lost, they failed to do that.
Biden kept his moderate credentials when many other candidates saw A.O.C.
on Twitter and decided to move left.
Many Democrats resent their own elites.
There is a quiet tension between Democrats who wield cultural power and those who donâ€™t.
The former are active on social media, and clobber the latter â€” people who say or write the â€œwrongâ€ thing.
The non-elites tend to feel judged and looked down on by the self-appointed savior class.
â€œPolitically correctâ€ has become the phrase people use to define those who use cultural power to enforce ideological conformity.
Seventy percent of Democrats who are not on social media say political correctness is a big problem.
These are people silently but vehemently reacting against this social reign of terror.
Biden communicates affection, not judgment, acceptance, not expulsion.
Have a better theory of social change.
Sanders and Warren imagine they can rally movements of progressive supermajorities to transform American politics.
The reality is that if they are elected weâ€™ll be stuck with the same 42 percent-to-42 percent stagnant political war we have now.
Biden starts with the understanding that we are a closely divided nation.
He understands the elemental fact that if you want to pass laws you have to go through Congress.
As Damon Linker pointed out recently in The Week, Bidenâ€™s argument is that a center-left congressional coalition is the best we can do under present circumstances.
Thatâ€™s a more realistic theory of change.
A beloved legislator like Biden is more likely to transform the political landscape than a down-the-line progressive.
Connection.
Connection.
Connection.
Many candidates pound the podium and lecture at their rallies.
Itâ€™s the big leader onstage and the passionate mass of followers down below.
Nobody makes an individual connection as well as Biden.
In a time when people feel exhausted, isolated and alienated, a candidate who seems normal and emotionally relatable is going to have a lot of appeal.
The ironic fact is that the candidate who can be vulnerable has a surprising power.
John Bolton Gets the Last Laugh By Frank Bruni Jan. 28, 2020  President Trumpâ€™s reaction to the leak of incriminating details in John Boltonâ€™s forthcoming book shocked me.
Not the part where the president said that Bolton was making up a Ukraine quid pro quo in the service of the best-seller list â€” that he was lying for lucre.
Trump sees that transaction everywhere he looks, because he sees it first and foremost in the mirror.
No, I was surprised that the president didnâ€™t dispute knowing Bolton, or at least didnâ€™t say that he was so slightly acquainted with his own former national security adviser that he couldnâ€™t pick him â€” chinchilla-bushy mustache and all â€” out of a lineup.
Thatâ€™s Trumpâ€™s favorite ploy.
Ask Michael Cohen, Anthony Scaramucci, Prince Andrew, Stormy Daniels, Gordon Sondland, Lev Parnas.
Fall into disrepute, cross Trump or claim to have the goods on him and youâ€™re wiped clean from his memory, no matter the existence of contradictory forensics.
Ivanka, beware.
Youâ€™re one bad manicure away from paternal amnesia.
Bolton is the impeachment star of the week, whether he winds up testifying or not, and I canâ€™t shake the feeling that he plotted all of this out: keeping his head down during the hearings in the House; letting it be known only afterward that heâ€™d be willing to testify in the Senate; the revelation this week â€” simultaneous with assertions by Trumpâ€™s defense team that there were no firsthand witnesses to the presidentâ€™s wrongdoing â€” that his book indeed addresses Ukraine and fully backs up the charges in the articles of impeachment.
Bolton has always been vain, brilliant and ruthless, and this is the timeline that a vain, brilliant and ruthless operator would cinch.
Iâ€™m not personally acquainted with the sound of his laughter, but Iâ€™m certain I hear it.
When Trump came down that escalator in June 2015, the laws of political gravity were suspended, and Boltonâ€™s emergence as a darling of Democrats is the latest example.
He was so far to the right and such a ferocious hawk that President George W. Bush bypassed the Senate to sneak him in as ambassador to the United Nations.
He later feathered a nest at Fox News, also known as the Trump administration applicant pool.
And at a time when most self-respecting foreign-policy mavens had concluded that Trump was toxic, Bolton opened his lips wide to the poison, signing on to become the presidentâ€™s third national security adviser.
Of course, the president is now on his fourth.
Trump canâ€™t dismiss Boltonâ€™s account of events as partisan.
Boltonâ€™s conservative credentials prove otherwise.
Trump canâ€™t bellow â€œdeep state,â€ not when he handpicked Bolton at a stage of his presidency when heâ€™d already become sensitive to that supposedly pernicious force.
All Trump can do is command his Republican minions in the Senate to fall in line.
Sadly, most of them will.
Donâ€™t be impressed by the possibility that now â€” and, I stress, only now â€” some Senate Republicans may press for witnesses, including Bolton, in the trial.
This isnâ€™t a stirring of conscience.
Itâ€™s a cloaking of humiliation.
If they ignore Bolton, their still-unshaken commitment to acquitting Trump becomes even more naked.
Besides, hearing from witnesses wouldnâ€™t erase Republican senatorsâ€™ awful behavior to this point in the trial: all the ugly gloating from the likes of Lindsey Graham that Adam Schiffâ€™s undeniable eloquence was for naught; Marsha Blackburnâ€™s pathologically exuberant attacks on the integrity of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman; Martha McSallyâ€™s disgraceful sniping at a perfectly polite television reporter (â€œliberal hack,â€ she spewed) and then her cynical use of that Trumpian outburst to raise money for her re-election campaign.
This is sycophancy at its most shameful.
Scratch that superlative: I was forgetting Mike Pompeo.
According to The Timesâ€™s scoop about Boltonâ€™s book, he writes that Pompeo, too, was aware of the Ukraine pressure campaign â€” the same Pompeo who did nothing to stop the vilification of Marie Yovanovitch; the same Pompeo who promoted the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election; the same Pompeo who once warned that Trump would be â€œan authoritarian president who ignored our Constitutionâ€ and then, when Trump gave him a really neat job, decided that a little authoritarianism never hurt anyone.
Of late he seems to be having a meltdown.
I attribute it to his realization that his reputation and belief in his own rectitude wonâ€™t survive Trump.
Heâ€™s assessing the bargain he made and understanding how completely his ambition eclipsed his integrity.
Itâ€™s hell when youâ€™re revealed to yourself.
Bolton, meanwhile, is probably feeling pretty content.
He knows how badly the Trump presidency will be judged and has positioned himself on the right side of history â€” this time around.
Maybe bitterness brought him here, maybe ego, maybe this quaint old thing called patriotism.
He survived Trump.
Iâ€™d read that book.
Let Us All Now Weep for Donald Trump By Frank Bruni Jan. 21, 2020  Donald Trump obviously relishes the role of bully.
But his greatest talent by far lies in playing the victim.
Heâ€™s a victim of Adam Schiff.
A victim of Nancy Pelosi.
A victim of all Democrats, really, and of his own seedy henchmen (Michael Cohen, Lev Parnas) and of the â€œdeep stateâ€ and of the â€œfake news mediaâ€ and of the entire establishment, whatever that is.
Heâ€™s a victim of so many forces so many times over that even â€œmartyrâ€ doesnâ€™t do justice to his lot, which is what you get when you multiply Job in the Old Testament by Mel Gibson in â€œBraveheartâ€ and add the protagonist of â€œUnbroken.â€  No president has ever been treated so badly.
Iâ€™m not being sarcastic.
Iâ€™m taking dictation: He has made this exact claim â€” repeatedly.
His victimhood is front and center in his defense against the articles of impeachment and in the legal papers filed by his lawyers on Monday, as his trial in the Senate moved forward.
The lawyers write of a process â€œriggedâ€ against Trump.
They portray his Democratic accusers as unhinged tormentors, too consumed with his destruction to see how unimpeachably he has really behaved.
The 171-page document is so soggy with Trumpian self-pity it weeps.
Itâ€™s so bloated with Trumpian hyperbole it waddles.
On just one of those pages, his lawyers recount how Democrats exercised â€œshameful hypocrisyâ€ as they â€œconcocted an unheard-of procedureâ€ and held those infamous â€œsecret hearings in a basement bunkerâ€ while journalists â€œhappily fed the public a false narrativeâ€ and the poor president was denied any rights whatsoever.
This is the bodice ripper of political sob stories.
Itâ€™s a Harlequin harangue.
It expands on â€” and continues in the precise spirit of â€” a preliminary legal brief that his lawyers filed last weekend.
â€œThe scream of a wounded animalâ€ was how two legal experts who contribute to The Atlantic assessed that argument.
They could as easily have been describing the rest of Trumpâ€™s presidency, the whole of his political career and much of his life.
Heâ€™s always right and yet always wronged.
He demands that we marvel at his invincibility even as we tremble at his degradation.
He can vanquish any enemy â€” and his enemies are legion!
â€” but look at how heâ€™s pushed around.
Trump takes a textbook oxymoron and gives it presidential form.
Behold, at the Resolute Desk, a jumbo shrimp.
â€œThis goes all the way back to his childhood,â€ Michael Dâ€™Antonio, the author of â€œThe Truth About Trump,â€ told me.
Dâ€™Antonio said that at the military-themed boarding school that Trump attended, he was known for complaining to superiors about unfair treatment.
â€œItâ€™s a strategy for him.
He believes and has said that whining is a way to get what you want.â€  Timothy Oâ€™Brien, who wrote the Trump biography â€œTrumpNation,â€ recalled that in the 1980s, when Trump failed to get the support that he wanted from Mayor Ed Koch for an enormous development in Manhattan, he threw himself a pity party, railing that â€œthe system and local government were conspiring against him.â€  Trump similarly fashioned himself as a beleaguered hero battling dark forces when he bought into the fledgling United States Football League and sought to make it competitive with the National Football League.
Goaded by Trump, the U.S.F.L.
filed an antitrust suit against the N.F.L.
The suit was a bust; the N.F.L.
was ordered to pay $3 in damages.
But that didnâ€™t throw him off his game, which he upsized for his presidential campaign.
As the conservative columnist Rich Lowry noted in August 2015: â€œBy Trumpâ€™s own account, heâ€™s the baddest, smartest thing going, except if you ask him a challenging question, in which case he kicks and screams and demands to know how anyone could treat him so unfairly.â€ Lowry crowned Trump â€œthe most fabulous whiner in all of American politics.â€  The CNN anchor Chris Cuomo subsequently asked Trump about Lowryâ€™s words.
â€œI am the most fabulous whiner,â€ Trump conceded.
â€œI keep whining and whining until I win.â€  He whined operatically as November 2016 approached and it seemed that heâ€™d lose to Hillary Clinton.
â€œThe election is going to be rigged,â€ he pouted, ever the victim.
Then he beat Clinton â€” and still whined, insisting without proof that sheâ€™d done better in the popular vote because of millions of illegal ballots.
Woe is he, the object of a â€œwitch huntâ€ regarding Russian assistance to his campaign, the butt of a â€œhoaxâ€ about improper pressure on Ukraine, the commander in chief of armed forces that the whole world takes advantage of.
In a key passage of the new book â€œA Very Stable Genius,â€ by the Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, Trump rants at top military brass about what he perceives as Americaâ€™s exploitation by South Korea and by NATO allies, barking, â€œYouâ€™re a bunch of dopes and babies.â€  Itâ€™s disgusting.
Itâ€™s also part of his political genius.
He has turned himself into a symbol of Americansâ€™ victimization, telling frustrated voters who crave easy answers that theyâ€™re being pushed around by foreigners and duped by the condescending custodians of a dysfunctional system.
Heâ€™s their proxy, suffering on their behalf, and in that way he collapses the distance between a billionaire with multiple golf resorts and displaced factory workers struggling to hold on to their one and only homes.
But while itâ€™s a fact that theyâ€™ve been dealt a bad hand, itâ€™s a farce that he has.
His fortune began with money from Dad.
He has stiffed creditors, evaded taxes, attached his name to a bogus diploma mill, skimmed money from a fraudulent philanthropy, run afoul of campaign finance laws, signaled receptiveness to Russian interference in the 2016 election and tried to obstruct the investigation of that â€” all without any commensurate punishment.
Thanks to Republicans in the Senate, heâ€™s poised to evade punishment again.
We should all be such victims.
Mayor Peteâ€™s Gay Reckoning By Frank Bruni Feb. 1, 2020  ANKENY, Iowa â€” You can listen to long stretches of Pete Buttigiegâ€™s remarks and hear little or no reference to the trailblazing nature of his campaign.
You can almost forget.
But as he wrapped up a rally here on Thursday night, with the clock ticking down fast to the Iowa caucuses, he made soaring, stirring mention of it.
You remembered.
â€œIowa has a remarkable knack for making history,â€ he told hundreds of supporters, noting that heâ€™d initially visited the state to support Barack Obama during the Democratic primary in 2008, when Obamaâ€™s Iowa victory set him on his way.
â€œYou changed Americaâ€™s â€” and the worldâ€™s â€” expectations for what was possible.â€  Then he alluded to Iowaâ€™s legalization of gay marriage in 2009, six years before that happened nationally, and how it gave him hope that he might someday â€œbe a happily married man.â€ The crowd roared.
I had one foot out the door â€” it had been a long, long day â€” and I stopped in my tracks.
As a gay man and an American, I felt a surge of pride.
Itâ€™s do-or-die time for Buttigieg, whose polls numbers recently have been moving in the wrong direction.
He probably needs to finish first or a very strong second on Monday to preserve any shot to be his partyâ€™s 2020 nominee.
He needs neither to claim an enormous accomplishment.
Win or lose, Buttigieg is the first openly gay American to become a serious presidential candidate, one who landed on the covers of prominent magazines, was fawned over on the most-watched television talk shows, raised exponentially more money than any of the governors in the race, outpaced Beto Oâ€™Rourke, outpolled Kamala Harris, caught President Trumpâ€™s attention, qualified for all of the Democratic debates and more than held his own in each of them.
Win or lose, heâ€™s an example, an education and a hell of a story.
That narrative is about youth â€” he just turned 38 â€” and the power of hyper-articulateness in an era of presidential crudeness.
But itâ€™s also about sexual orientation, which has and hasnâ€™t factored into his pitch in surprising ways.
He has grappled, on the national political stage, with questions that all L.G.B.T.Q.
people ask, so that his candidacy is a metaphor for our lives: To what extent am I defined by my sexual orientation or gender identity?
What does and doesnâ€™t it tell you about me?
Buttigiegâ€™s answers have disappointed some L.G.B.T.Q.
people â€” and were bound to, given the expectations placed on any politician who is blessed and cursed to become a symbol.
Female candidates have had experiences similar to his; candidates of color, too.
These pioneers are exhorted to open doors closed to the groups they represent but to represent those groups first and foremost, and thatâ€™s tough.
Check with Obama.
Or Hillary Clinton.
Or, now, Buttigieg.
He has weathered complaints, even derision, from L.G.B.T.Q.
progressives, many of whom say heâ€™s not gay enough, his manner and mannerisms too strait-laced, his policy preoccupations too moderate, his success infuriatingly reflective of how readily and well he assimilates into heterosexual America.
â€œGays Seem to Be Mayor Peteâ€™s Worst Criticsâ€ was the headline of a column in The Washington Blade, an L.G.B.T.Q.
publication.
That saddens me.
As Iâ€™ve written before, part of what so many gay people have fought so hard for is the recognition that we donâ€™t fit into tidy boxes, otherwise known as stereotypes â€” not sartorially, not ideologically.
Absolutely disagree with Buttigiegâ€™s opposition to â€œMedicare for allâ€ if you have a different view, but donâ€™t suggest that he should support it because heâ€™s gay.
Yawn at all those perfectly pressed white dress shirts that he wears, but donâ€™t cast them as a betrayal.
And donâ€™t say that by discussing his own Christianity, heâ€™s consorting with the enemy.
Yes, religion has been used cruelly against L.G.B.T.Q.
people.
But one of the most profound dimensions of Buttigiegâ€™s candidacy is how he has turned that around, for instance asserting that his marriage to his husband, Chasten, has brought him â€œcloser to God.â€  â€œThatâ€™s the thing that I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand,â€ he said in a speech last year, referring to the vice presidentâ€™s anti-gay record.
â€œThat if you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me.
Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.â€  Buttigieg has campaigned frequently with his husband, embracing him onstage, and has mentioned his marriage in debates.
And he doesnâ€™t shy away from questions about his sexual orientation, which he didnâ€™t publicly acknowledge until the age of 33, shortly before his election to a second term as mayor of South Bend, Ind.
But he doesnâ€™t volunteer lengthy ruminations about its impact on how he sees the world or showcase it in any other way.
Itâ€™s there if you look and listen for it.
But sometimes you have to look and listen hard.
None of the voters at his rallies in Iowa brought it up when I asked them what drew them to Buttigieg.
They mostly raved about his intelligence.
Were there any particular obstacles he might face in a general election?
â€œHis youth,â€ said Louann Cooling, 62, of Le Grand, Iowa.
It was the same answer â€” his youth, or his inexperience â€” that others gave.
No one mentioned his being openly gay.
Being gay and an emblem of progress hasnâ€™t given Buttigieg any special traction with younger Democrats, who respond much less favorably to him than older Democrats do.
It hasnâ€™t established any solidarity with other minorities, though he reached for such a connection when stating a commitment to racial justice during the Democratsâ€™ November debate.
â€œWhile I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate,â€ he said.
â€œWearing this wedding ring in a way that couldnâ€™t have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.â€  Those remarks didnâ€™t have the effect he intended.
Some African-Americans accused him of equating very different kinds of discrimination, and polls show that his support from black Democrats remains abysmal.
When they appraise Buttigieg, they notice a whole lot beyond his sexual orientation, including worrisome friction between him and some black residents of South Bend and a path of extraordinary privilege (Harvard, a Rhodes scholarship, a job with McKinsey) that brought him to this point.
What does Buttigiegâ€™s being gay tell you?
That he has trepidation and caution in him â€” he stayed in the closet all those years â€” but that he has courage, too, enough to pursue the presidency despite the inevitable spotlight on him as a novelty.
What doesnâ€™t his being gay tell you?
His musical tastes, for one.
The last time I had a long talk with him was in mid-December, and he had just met the performer Lizzo, who was a fellow guest on â€œCBS This Morning.â€ Sheâ€™s an icon for outsiders, brimming with delicious attitude, and I assumed heâ€™d be thrilled.
But Iâ€™m not sure he really does â€œthrilled,â€ and he confessed to being more a Dave Matthews Band fan.
In any case, he said, â€œI usually have a kind of celebrity blindness.â€  A gay man who doesnâ€™t twinkle at the stars around him?
Yep, our creator makes us in all shapes and stripes.
Thank you, Mayor Pete, for taking that message out on the trail.
No, Team Trump, the Coronavirus Isnâ€™t Good for America By Paul Krugman Jan. 30, 2020  How frightened should you be about the coronavirus?
Iâ€™m no epidemiologist, but what Iâ€™ve seen looks pretty scary.
It doesnâ€™t help that the Trump administration, as part of its general war against science and expertise, has seriously reduced Americaâ€™s capacity to respond if we do face a dangerous pandemic.
It also looks quite possible that the virus will inflict a lot of economic damage â€” even if it doesnâ€™t kill you, it might kill your job.
And one special source of concern is that top officials in the Trump administration are talking nonsense about the economic threat.
So, about that economic threat: Many people are drawing parallels between the coronavirus and the 2002-3 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which also originated in China.
Like the current outbreak, SARS led to the imposition of economically disruptive quarantines, which appear to have had a significant if temporary adverse effect on Chinaâ€™s economy, and a modest negative impact on the world economy as a whole.
We still donâ€™t know whether the coronavirus is more or less dangerous than SARS.
What we do know is that the global economic implications of a pandemic in China are likely to be much more severe now than they were then, for the simple reason that China is a vastly bigger player than it used to be.
In 2002 China was still in the early stages of its great economic surge; it accounted for only around 8 percent of global manufacturing value added, far less than the shares of the U.S., Japan and Europe.
Today, however, China is the workshop of the world, accounting for more than a quarter of global manufacturing.
Now, you might think that this implies an upside to Chinaâ€™s troubles, that disrupting Chinaâ€™s vast manufacturing sector would offer opportunities to producers in other countries, including the United States.
That is, you might think this if you knew nothing about 21st-century economics.
Sure enough, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, appeared on Fox Business on Thursday morning to declare that he â€œdidnâ€™t want to talk about a victory lap,â€ but that the coronavirus â€œwill help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America.â€ By saying this, he demonstrated a couple of things: (1) why Gail Collinsâ€™s readers voted him Trumpâ€™s worst cabinet member, and (2) why Trumpâ€™s trade war has been such a failure.
What Ross and his colleagues apparently still donâ€™t understand â€” although some of them may be getting an inkling â€” is that modern manufacturing isnâ€™t like manufacturing a couple of generations ago, when different countriesâ€™ industrial sectors were engaged in fairly straightforward head-to-head competition.
These days we live in a world of global value chains, in which much of what any given nation imports consists not of consumer goods but of â€œintermediateâ€ goods that it uses as part of its own production process.
In such a world, anything that disrupts imports â€” whether itâ€™s tariffs or a virus â€” raises production costs, and as a result if anything hurts manufacturing.
Indeed, a recent study by the Federal Reserve found that Trumpâ€™s tariffs, which were concentrated on intermediate goods, have reduced, not increased, manufacturing output and employment.
Sure enough, while overall economic growth in 2019 was decent (not great), manufacturing is in a recession.
(And the uncertainty created by the trade war may explain why business investment is down despite a huge cut in corporate taxes.)
As I said, some of Trumpâ€™s people seem to have gotten an inkling here.
Last week the White House basically admitted that tariffs on steel and aluminum have done more harm than good, hurting industries that use these materials.
But the administrationâ€™s answer isnâ€™t a reconsideration of its policies â€” it is to impose more tariffs, on a wider range of products.
Which brings me back to the coronavirus.
Letâ€™s leave aside the public health issues â€” although the Trump administration has clearly left us much less prepared than we had been to deal with these issues if they become serious â€” and focus on the economics.
What we can say is that if the virus seriously disrupts Chinese production, its impact on the U.S. economy will be like an extreme version of Trumpâ€™s trade war, except without any compensation in the form of tariff revenue.
And the two things we know about the trade war are that it has been an economic bust and that Trumpâ€™s officials still appear clueless about why it has been a bust.
Bear in mind that so far Trump has been remarkably lucky.
Aside from Hurricane Maria â€” which he mishandled, and in which thousands of Americans died â€” he has faced essentially no crises, domestic or foreign, that werenâ€™t of his own making.
And he has surrounded himself with the gang that couldnâ€™t think straight, which raises severe doubts about how well he would handle a crisis that he didnâ€™t create himself.
If Wilbur Rossâ€™s boneheaded remarks on Thursday are any indication â€” and I fear they are â€” the Trump administration is even less prepared to deal with the economic fallout from a possible pandemic than it is to deal with the public health crisis.
Be afraid.
Notorious D.J.T.
on Trial By Maureen Dowd Jan. 25, 2020  Republicans know very well who they are.
Thatâ€™s why it was such a juicy moment when Hakeem Jeffries, the congressman from Brooklyn and Democratic impeachment manager, quoted a lyric by fellow B-town native son Biggie Smalls to rebut Jay Sekulow when the presidentâ€™s lawyer disingenuously wondered, â€œWhy are we here?â€  Referring to the Democratsâ€™ crystal-clear case that Donald Trump abused his power and corrupted the highest office in the land, Jeffries proclaimed, â€œAnd if you donâ€™t know, now you know.â€  I went to the press gallery one afternoon to check out the tableau vivant.
The visitorsâ€™ gallery was only half full, and there was none of the passion and titillation that infused the Clinton impeachment, which also, oddly enough, revolved around a power disparity between two people.
One Democratic Senate staffer mourned the apathy.
â€œOur phones arenâ€™t ringing,â€ he told me.
â€œNobody cares.
Itâ€™s the saddest thing ever.â€  One side of the room seemed to be smirking.
Mitch McConnell is resorting to his Merrick Garland playbook.
Heâ€™ll let the Democrats make all their noble points, but itâ€™s Kabuki.
Republicans have perfected the dark art of â€œThereâ€™s nothing to see here, just keep moving.â€ McConnell long ago choreographed the end, with Democrats losing the argument and the acquitted scoundrel triumphantly sweeping into the Capitol to make his State of the Union address.
At night, tipsy Republican staffers treated Senate office buildings as a pub crawl, roaming the halls with celebratory bottles of wine.
Some Republicans were paying attention at the trial â€” or wanted to be seen paying attention.
Susan Collins was glued to the proceedings, as was the senator to her left in a magma-colored shawl, Lisa Murkowski.
Republicans like Collins who are vulnerable in 2020 have to be alert and figure out how to find their way out of the hearings without doing more political harm.
A Trump confidant told CBS News that Republican senators were warned, â€œVote against the president and your head will be on a pike.â€  Seated at the back of the class, Mitt Romney looked dutiful, and the thought must have crossed his mind thatâ€™s heâ€™s in a position to inflict payback on Trump for calling him â€œa pompous assâ€ and tricking him into an interview for secretary of state only to humiliate him.
(Revenge is a dish best served with milk.)
But more senators on the Republican side were telegraphing boredom.
Lindsey Graham yawned and rearranged his yellow pencil and went on walkabouts, later telling reporters, â€œAbout the fourth time you tell me the same thing is twice too much.â€ He cleaved to his lap-dog role, saying preposterously of Trump: â€œWhat he wants to do is get to the truth.â€  Tom Cotton played with the fidget spinner Richard Burr had handed out to all the Republicans.
Marsha Blackburn and others left to trash the proceedings on Fox News.
The senators in the Democratic presidential race could not have been happy to be stuck there, either.
Bernie Sanders, accustomed to making like Leonard Bernstein at big rallies and upset heâ€™s not in Iowa to relish his surge, had a hard time keeping his hands still, moving them restlessly, silently clapping, and finally holding them together on his chest over his blue sweater.
But heads on both sides did snap to attention whenever that unholy, jangly, self-impeaching peal, so inescapable in the last three years, rang out in the hallowed chamber.
Trumpâ€™s voice was impossible to ignore when the House impeachment managers played incriminating video clips of the human fidget spinner himself, sometimes howling over the blades of his chopper on the South Lawn.
So many people in this very room had tried and failed, or are now trying, to vanquish the guy.
Romney, Cruz, Rubio, Graham, Klobuchar, Sanders, Bennet, Booker, Gillibrand, Warren, Harris.
Trump had savaged all his fellow Republicans and yet here they were listening to an unending recitation of his crimes and coming out to be his Praetorian guard.
Adam Schiff tried to warn the former nemeses turned defenders of Trump that if the president is not removed, he could turn on them the way he had turned on Marie Yovanovitch and Joe Biden, using the power of the presidency to cheat, lie and smear.
(Now Rudyâ€™s buddy Lev Parnas says he has forked over to congressional Democrats a 2018 recording of Trump personally ordering Yovanovitch to be fired.)
â€œThe next time, it just may be you,â€ Schiff told the Republican senators.
â€œDo you think he wouldnâ€™t ask you to be investigated?
Do you think for a moment that he wouldnâ€™t?â€  Schiff also reminded Republicans that Trump had inverted their dogma, embracing the Evil Empire and authoritarianism and trusting Crazy Rudyâ€™s conspiracy theories over his own intelligence services.
â€œYou donâ€™t realize how important character is in the highest office in the land until you donâ€™t have it,â€ Schiff said.
But the more impressive the Democratsâ€™ case is, the more depressing the reality becomes.
They want to convince themselves that character matters.
But many Americans knew they were voting for a thug.
They wanted a thug who would bust up Washington, and they got one.
The Democrats are relying on facts, but the Republicans are relying on Fox.
And if you donâ€™t know, now you know.
Of All Trumpâ€™s Defenses, This Is the Lamest By Frank Bruni Jan. 25, 2020  Once the Senate concludes its trial of President Trump, it should go into recess.
Until next January.
The House, too.
Lawmakers shouldnâ€™t pass legislation, consider nominations or make any important decisions whatsoever: This is an election year, and the voters will soon weigh in on the direction of America.
The nationâ€™s business should await that judgment, lest members of Congress contradict it.
A ludicrous proposal?
Indeed.
But itâ€™s in line with â€” and an extrapolation of â€” a favorite argument against Trumpâ€™s conviction and removal from office.
His Republican supporters say that lawmakers shouldnâ€™t speak for voters on such a crucial issue.
To pre-empt the verdict at the ballot box, they say, is to subvert the peopleâ€™s will.
Nice try.
Lawmakers are elected specifically to speak for voters on crucial issues.
Thatâ€™s the system.
Thatâ€™s their job.
American government doesnâ€™t operate by daily, hourly or issue-by-issue polls (at least not overtly).
Congress doesnâ€™t have exponentially more power one week after Election Day than it does one year later (though it may indeed have more political currency).
And lawmakers shouldnâ€™t defer to their constituents at every turn.
Those constituents expect them, over the course of their legislative terms, to use their judgment as better-informed proxies for the people they represent.
So does the Constitution, which created America as a representative democracy, not a direct one.
Our lawmakers are supposed to lead as well as follow, to be responsive to public sentiment but not mesmerized or paralyzed by it.
Thatâ€™s even truer when the stakes are huge than when theyâ€™re small.
Republicans have decided to sing a different tune.
If it sounds familiar, thatâ€™s because they turned to the same music when the Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died, President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace him and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, declared that a presidential election about eight months in the offing prevented the Senate from taking any action.
It was a song not of principle but of political convenience.
The same holds true now.
â€œGive the people back their power,â€ the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, implored a few months ago, arguing against impeachment itself.
Referring to the presidentâ€™s transgression and the November 2020 election, McConnell said, â€œThe American people, if they think this is a very significant episode, can take it into account.â€ Senator Lindsey Graham chimed in: â€œI really do believe that the best person â€” group of people â€” to pick a president are the voters, not a bunch of partisan politicians.â€ Pat Cipollone, one of the presidentâ€™s lawyers, added: â€œNo one ever thought that it would be a good idea for our country â€” for our children, for our grandchildren â€” to try to remove a president from a ballot, to deny the American people the right to vote.â€  No one?
Really?
How about the framers of the Constitution, who established the impeachment process to do essentially that and declined to add any asterisks about the next electionâ€™s imminence?
â€œIf the framers thought impeachment in an election year was a bad idea, they could have set things up differently,â€ noted Jill Lepore, a Harvard history professor and the author of the 2018 book â€œThese Truths: A History of the United States.â€  â€œThey could have instituted a mechanism for an interim election, for instance,â€ Lepore told me.
â€œThey did not.
They could have said, â€˜Except not in an election year.â€™ They did not.
You want there to be no impeachments allowed in an election year, ever?
You have to get a constitutional amendment ratified.â€ And that would never happen, because it would be license for a president to do anything he or she wanted, fearlessly, if it synced with the calendar just so.
The framers, in fact, wanted a government that wasnâ€™t too sensitive to voters â€” that mediated votersâ€™ whims and prejudices through representatives presumably taking a longer, cooler view.
Senatorsâ€™ six-year terms reflect that.
As Alison LaCroix, a University of Chicago professor who teaches constitutional law and American history, told me, â€œThe Senate is supposed to have a little more deliberative power and maybe be a little less beholden to the people.â€ When senators say they should kick an issue back to the people, theyâ€™re arguably violating the spirit of the chamber.
LaCroix made another excellent point: Whatâ€™s happening to Trump isnâ€™t muscling voters out of the process but, rather, taking into account what voters recently did.
â€œYou only get an impeachment vote when people have changed their minds,â€ she said, referring to their opinions about a sitting president.
â€œThe votes comes from the House, and we know, from things like the midterm elections, that some amount of people have changed their minds.
Another party has gained control of the House.
That has to be telling us something.â€  Granted, that switch in the House majority wasnâ€™t a referendum on Trumpâ€™s interactions with Ukraine, which were the grounds for his impeachment and hadnâ€™t yet come to light.
But they were absolutely a referendum, in part, on his behavior and character.
Lawmakers who are now assessing and acting on the worst of that behavior and character are hardly turning a deaf ear to voters.
If Republican leaders were really so invested in a government that didnâ€™t diverge from votersâ€™ desires, more of them would be questioning the Electoral College.
Because of it, the country has a president, Trump, who received about three million fewer votes than his opponent.
Because of it, George W. Bush won the 2000 presidential election despite being the choice of fewer Americans than Al Gore.
But both Trump and Bush are Republicans.
So itâ€™s fine if the system and voter sentiment arenâ€™t perfectly aligned.
Similarly, Republicans â€” Democrats, too â€” are fond of tarring opponents by saying that theyâ€™re too beholden to polls.
The implication is that elected officials should have the courage of their own convictions and not outsource their judgment to constituents.
Saying that only voters should decide Trumpâ€™s fate is precisely such outsourcing.
And Election Day is essentially the biggest poll of all.
Thereâ€™s an additional, profoundly important wrinkle in the case of Trumpâ€™s impeachment and trial.
They stem specifically from actions he took to corrupt the next presidential election by getting a foreign government to smear a potential rival.
To give those actions a pass is to green-light more of the same or worse, meaning that votersâ€™ verdict on Trumpâ€™s behavior might be fatally tainted: not a clean expression of popular will but a product of, well, cheating.
The election canâ€™t be the remedy when the election is whatâ€™s at issue.
But McCarthy, McConnell and other Republicans are determined to spare their party the humiliation of Trumpâ€™s removal and to protect themselves from his wrath (and his baseâ€™s fury) if he isnâ€™t saved.
So they reach for whatever arguments they can.
Some are more plausible than others.
The assertion that an election next November forbids honor this January is a joke, and the framers would have laughed at it.
Bernieâ€™s Angry Bros By Bret Stephens Jan. 31, 2020  Barbara Boxer minces no words when it comes to describing the people usually known as the Bernie Bros â€” a subset of Bernie Sanders supporters who hope to take over the Democratic Party and remake it in their image.
â€œThere is so much negative energy; itâ€™s so angry,â€ says the former four-term Democratic senator from California.
â€œYou can be angry about the unfairness in the world.
But this becomes a personal, deep-seated anger at anyone who doesnâ€™t say exactly what you want to hear.â€  I ran into Boxer earlier this week and got to talking about a superb report in The Times by my colleagues Matt Flegenheimer, Rebecca R. Ruiz and Nellie Bowles: â€œBernie Sanders and His Internet Army.â€ The piece briefly mentions a 2016 incident in which Boxer went to Nevada to try to unify the party after Hillary Clinton defeated Bernie Sanders in the stateâ€™s caucus.
Boxer was an early Clinton supporter.
But sheâ€™s also a liberal lioness and felt sure she could mollify the crowd.
â€œI thought I could get the booing down,â€ she recalled.
â€œI said: â€˜Why are you booing?
Iâ€™m Bernieâ€™s friend.
When you boo me, youâ€™re booing Bernie.â€™â€  Things only got worse.
The heckling got louder.
Someone picked up a chair as if to throw it.
â€œSecurity whispers in my ear, youâ€™ve got to get off the stage,â€ Boxer said.
â€œWhen I left, my heart was pounding.
Iâ€™d never had that before.â€  Boxerâ€™s story is one of the milder ones The Times tells about the Internet trolls whose goals seem to have less to do with building Sanders up than with hounding and humiliating anyone who stands in their manâ€™s way.
â€œWhen Mr. Sandersâ€™s supporters swarm someone online, they often find multiple access points to that personâ€™s life, compiling what can amount to investigative dossiers,â€ The Times reported.
â€œMore commonly, there is a barrage of jabs and threats sometimes framed as jokes.
If the target is a woman, and it often is, these insults can veer toward her physical appearance.â€  Does this mean Sanders himself supports this kind of behavior?
No, and occasionally he tries to disavow it.
But not very hard: Last year, he hired as a top aide and speechwriter David Sirota, accurately described by The Atlantic as â€œhis Twitter attack dog.â€  Nor does it mean that anything like a majority of Sandersâ€™s supporters support the nastiness carried out in his name.
Yet no other Democratic candidate has so many venomous followers â€” no Biden Brothers or Warren Sisters to return fire with fire.
The only real analog in U.S. politics today to the Bernie nasties are the Trump nasties.
They resemble each other in ways neither side cares to admit.
The most obvious resemblance is the adulation they bestow on their respective champions, whom they treat less as normal politicians than as saviors who deserve uncritical and uncompromising support.
â€œSurrender to a leader is not a means to an end but a fulfillment,â€ the philosopher Eric Hoffer observed in â€œThe True Believer,â€ a book that remains as relevant in our populist era as it was in the totalitarian one.
â€œWhither they are led is of secondary importance.â€  Since itâ€™s the usual destiny of saviors to be persecuted before theyâ€™re exalted, the response of their followers often is to persecute back.
But persecute whom?
In the demonology of most mass movements there is usually a near enemy and a far one, and the near enemy must be dealt with first and hardest.
To this day, hard-core Trump supporters reserve their deepest spite for Republican NeverTrump holdouts (â€œhuman scum,â€ according to the president).
Just so with the Bernie Bros, who see more moderate Democrats not as kindred spirits or potential converts but as sellouts, even traitors â€” the proverbial enemy within.
Partly this is about the normal competition for power, in which the show of ideological purity is treated as evidence of moral superiority.
But it also goes to the heart of what the Bernie Bros are really about.
As they see it, ordinary civility isnâ€™t a virtue.
Itâ€™s a ruse by which those with power manipulate and marginalize those without.
Democrats like Joe Biden who play by the rules of civility and bipartisanship arenâ€™t just falling prey to the insidious manipulation.
They are perpetrating and legitimizing it.
No wonder nearly half of Sandersâ€™s supporters wonâ€™t commit to or are unsure about voting for the Democratic nominee in the event it isnâ€™t Bernie, according to a recent poll.
Why bother voting for Oligarchy Lite?
If there is a silver lining here, itâ€™s that the world has long experience with this brand of zealotry.
Bernie Sanders may not be one of his own awful Bros, and may condemn their worst excesses.
But thereâ€™s no reason to think theyâ€™ll lose their influence should he win the White House â€” just as Trumpâ€™s presidency has emboldened and empowered many of his own worst followers.
Is this the Democratic Party the Democrats want?
They will cast their first votes for president on Monday evening at the party caucuses in Iowa.
Now is the moment for second thoughts.
Only You Can Prevent Dystopia By Farhad Manjoo Jan. 1, 2020  The new year is here, and online, the forecast calls for several seasons of hell.
Tech giants and the media have scarcely figured out all that went wrong during the last presidential election â€” viral misinformation, state-sponsored propaganda, bots aplenty, all of us cleaved into our own tribal reality bubbles â€” yet here we go again, headlong into another experiment in digitally mediated democracy.
Iâ€™ll be honest with you: Iâ€™m terrified.
I spend a lot of my time looking for edifying ways of interacting with technology.
In the last year, Iâ€™ve told you to meditate, to keep a digital journal, to chat with people on the phone and to never tweet.
Still, I enter the new decade with a feeling of overwhelming dread.
Thereâ€™s a good chance the internet will help break the world this year, and Iâ€™m not confident we have the tools to stop it.
Unless, that is, we are all really careful.
As Smokey Bear might say of our smoldering online discourse: Only you can prevent dystopia!
And so: Here are a few tips for improving the digital world in 2020.
Virality is a red flag.
Suspect it.
If I were king of the internet, I would impose an ironclad rule: No one is allowed to share any piece of content without waiting a day to think it over.
Virality was once the delightful miracle of a networked age; youâ€™d see a funny video going around, get caught up in the collective wonder and hilarity, and forward it on to your 100 closest pals.
At its meme-ified best, participating in this sort of viral feast felt like a boon to collective social bonding.
Remember, kids, that one glorious day we were all talking about the crazy dress?
What times, what times!
But, The Dress notwithstanding, in the 2010s virality got too easy, and then it grew sour, venal and dishonest.
Nobodyâ€™s counting, but by my unscientific estimate almost everything that became instantly popular online in the last decade turned out to be problematic in one way or another.
That photo of the shark washed onto a freeway by a hurricane?
Fake.
The culture-war-defining outrage your aunt just posted to Facebook?
Debunked, of course.
The suddenly popular influencer?
A â€œmilkshake duckâ€ running from his past.
Social networks and even governments are looking into ways to curb viral misinformation, but this fight will define our age.
The root of the problem is that humans are weak, gullible dolts; every day many of us, even people who should know better â€” folks with fancy jobs and blue check marks next to our handles â€” keep falling for online hoaxes.
Virality hijacks our better instincts, and because so many of the internetâ€™s business models benefit from instant popularity, thereâ€™s a great deal of money and power riding on our failings.
There is only one long-term fix: that a critical number of us alter how we approach viral content.
Letâ€™s all consciously embark on a mind-set shift.
In 2020, question anything that everyoneâ€™s talking about, especially if it fits all your priors, or thereâ€™s some kind of ad money involved.
(Hint: Thereâ€™s always ad money involved.)
If you canâ€™t stop sharing, at least slow your roll.
The stakes are enormous; thereâ€™s no room for error.
Strive to be better, please.
Resist the easy dunk.
In the 2010s, Twitter became the center of the political universe.
In some ways this was for the better â€” Twitter is a haven for righteous activism against the global powers that be â€” but most times, it was for the worse.
Twitter is a daily toxic nightmare of reflexive egotism and groupthink that will prompt you to question your priorities, not to mention your sanity.
Which is why, if youâ€™re on Twitter and canâ€™t muster the will to never tweet, you should at least consider it your duty in 2020 to resist the networkâ€™s worst impulses, for your sake and all of ours, too.
Whatâ€™s Twitterâ€™s most damaging sin?
I say itâ€™s the too-easy mocking joke â€” whatâ€™s known, in the jargon, as the â€œquote-tweet dunk.â€  Here are two canonical examples:  This scurrilous maneuver works like so: You spot an easily ridiculed tweet by a member of some rival social or political tribe.
Like a 1990s fourth grader with phasers set to â€œModed!â€ you add a pithy rejoinder thatâ€™s sure to please your side.
Itâ€™s best if you elide context, depth or any intention of dialogue; just straight-up make fun of the person.
Then mash on the retweet button to broadcast your supposedly clever jape.
The mechanism is part of the problem â€” when you quote-tweet someone on Twitter, the service shows off your remark to your own followers while leaving the original posterâ€™s followers in the dark.
(Another Twitter feature, the Reply, lets followers of both users see a response.)
If Twitter is a cocktail party, the quote-tweet dunk is the equivalent of overhearing a guy across the room say something ridiculous, then inviting the whole room to point and giggle at the idiot over there.
The imbalance discourages any possibility of meaningful conversation and reduces all of political discourse to empty, shallow quippery.
The thing about the quote-tweet dunk is that it can feel incredibly intoxicating; in the heat of some white-hot political moment, itâ€™s always tempting to shoot the fish in the barrel and watch the Likes roll in.
I swore off dunks years ago, but I still find myself aping Michael Jordan now and again.
Twitter could instantly improve itself by removing quote-tweet as a feature.
Failing that, take the oath with me: If the jokeâ€™s too obvious to resist, let it go.
Find a well-moderated corner of the internet.
It can sometimes seem as if all the internet is deep fakes and culture wars, Trump tweets and influencer scams.
Itâ€™s not, of course.
The internet still abounds in lovely, wholesome niches â€” the fantasy sports circles, the YouTube and Instagram communities devoted to any kind of craft, the many subreddits where strangers come together to help one another out of real problems in life.
What distinguishes the productive online communities from the disturbing ones?
Often itâ€™s something simple: content moderation.
The best places online are bounded by clear, well-enforced community guidelines for participation.
Twitter and Facebook are toxic because there are few rules and few penalties for flouting them.
A Reddit community like r/relationships, meanwhile, is a haven of incredible, empathetic discussion because its hosts spend a lot of effort policing the discussion toward productive dialogue.
This gets at the plain truth of the internet: A better digital world takes work.
Itâ€™s work all of us should do.
Pete Ainâ€™t It By Farhad Manjoo Dec. 18, 2019  A funny debate has been roiling the online left: Do young liberals hate Pete Buttigieg too little, or too much?
In the past few months, Buttigieg, the presidential candidate and young mayor of tiny South Bend, Ind., has enjoyed a steady, unlikely rise in early state polls.
But with success has come a backlash, and then a backlash to the backlash.
On paper, Buttigieg ticks a lot of presidential-candidate boxes; you canâ€™t write about Mayor Pete without mentioning heâ€™s a Rhodes scholar, heâ€™s a veteran and he has an articulate, cool-tempered decency reminiscent of Barack Obama.
And yet the mayor has drawn the ire of the plugged-in progressive left.
Thereâ€™s something curious about the disdain, notes Derek Thompson in The Atlantic.
In a field of many other milquetoast moderates â€” including the front-runner Joe Biden â€” why has Mayor Pete been singled out for special skewering by young radicals?
I am not so young, but I am one of those crazy radicals who have been concerned about the intractable domination of our society by a small band of wealthy interests.
So Iâ€™ll tell you why I donâ€™t like Buttigieg.
Itâ€™s not because I think heâ€™d be an especially bad president.
Like Biden, the mayor seems to possess the baseline capacity to run America in a way that isnâ€™t an embarrassment or a disgrace, which would certainly be a step up from the current administration.
He has also articulated some interesting policy ideas, and he has managed to win a lot of hearts online â€” a talent, of a sort, in an election measured in cheesy viral hits.
Yet every time I hear him speak, I get the sense that heâ€™s trying too hard to please everyone and that â€” in a way that recalls some of Obamaâ€™s worst tendencies toward misguided centrism â€” heâ€™ll end up pleasing no one in the process.
Ultimately, I worry Buttigieg will easily lose to Trump because he is ill suited to make the simplest and most powerful argument against the current administrationâ€™s apparent economic successes.
That argument goes like this: Though the economic stats look pretty good, the Trump boom is a mirage and a moral disgrace.
Todayâ€™s seemingly rosy climate is the culmination of a political economy that consistently rewards the already wealthy at the expense of everyone else.
The only way to reverse the trend toward inequality is to reform the way America does business.
A politician who pushes for these reforms needs courage, because the forces arrayed against structural change are powerful.
But while Mayor Pete has outlined several progressive-sounding ideas for overhauling Americansâ€™ economic lives â€” including a call for universal health care (that will still include a hefty role for private corporations), an idea for lowering student debt (but not making college free), a promise to strengthen regulations against monopolies (but a reluctance to break up Big Tech) â€” he lacks authenticity.
Rather than fundamental reform, many of his proposals end up sounding like opportunistic incrementalism, as if he wants to be seen to be doing something without really doing much at all, for fear of arousing the forces arrayed against reform.
Even Biden, who has built his brand on common-man folksisms, seems more believable, and he has explicitly promised billionaires that nothing much will change for them.
My fears about Mayor Peteâ€™s easy way with the wealthy were confirmed this week, when he convened a group of big-money donors on a tour through Silicon Valley.
I wasnâ€™t surprised that he has proved so attractive to the tech set.
With his slick, easy optimism, Mayor Pete reminds me of so many techies who promise big, disruptive change while refusing to accept the full costs of achieving their idealism.
For them, thereâ€™s always an easy, slapdash, cost-free revolution: Just use the right hashtag on Instagram and you, too, can spark regime change in the Arab world.
I suspect weâ€™ll need a bolder candidate to take on Trumpism and corporate control.
The Mayor from McKinsey is the wrong man to make the case.
The Democrat who meets Trump in 2020 will face a big challenge: countering the idea that Trumpâ€™s economic policies are â€œworking,â€ at least according to the traditional way we measure this stuff.
The American economy, we are told, is resplendent and aglow.
Thanks to a tax cut that swelled corporate coffers and a frenzy of deregulation that unleashed long-term dangers in exchange for short-term profits, the hits just keep coming: Weâ€™re now in the longest expansion in history, with little sign of abating.
Job growth regularly defies naysayers.
The stock market seems to set a record more often than people stream Mariah Carey Christmas hits.
On CNBC the other day, the anchor Jim Cramer, reflecting the mood of Wall Street, said, â€œThese are the best numbers of our lives."
For the president, the political argument here is straightforward.
Like Bill Clinton in 1996 or Ronald Reagan in 1984, Trump is planning to point to an economy doing its best George Costanza: Weâ€™re back, baby, weâ€™re back!
Every week on Twitter, Trump chef-kisses new economic stats as if heâ€™d personally assembled the national dish.
Thatâ€™s one way to put it.
Hereâ€™s another way: This economy is stupid.
As my colleague David Leonhardt writes, headline economic stats are increasingly divorced from more substantive metrics on American well-being.
This is a country in which prosperity rains on the rich while hundreds of thousands of people go bankrupt every year for getting sick.
This is a country in which it is not unusual to encounter developing-world misery alongside the most obscene collections of wealth ever recorded.
Thereâ€™s a lot of job growth, but a lot of the jobs are low-wage, high-toil jobs.
Itâ€™s a country in which every nearly every economic sector trends toward monopoly and oligarchy, and in which regulators let companies call the shots â€” see the F.A.A.
and Boeing or the F.T.C.
and Google.
Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have turned these dismal realities into the central pillars of their campaigns.
Both are calling for policies that fundamentally overhaul corporate control of the economy.
As their detractors note, itâ€™s unlikely that they will be able to achieve many of those goals in our polarized political climate.
But what matters to me is that they are making the case.
They have articulated both far-reaching, structural policy goals and political strategies that mesh with the spirit of those goals.
Not only are they calling for fundamental change that will alter vast sectors of the economy; they are also committed to undoing the influence of corporations and the wealthy in their own path to the White House, underscoring their commitment to their goals.
I donâ€™t see how Mayor Pete can make a similarly compelling case.
I donâ€™t see how he can take on Trumpâ€™s economy without at least attempting to fight the C.E.O.s who championed the corporate cash-grab that made it so hot.
And I donâ€™t see how he can take on those C.E.O.s while holding fund-raisers in Napa Valley â€œwine caves.â€  Mayor Pete seems like a lovely man.
Thatâ€™s the problem.
Heâ€™ll get eaten alive by the corporate machine that now runs the world.
Pompeo Called Me a â€˜Liar.â€™ Thatâ€™s Not What Bothers Me.
By Mary Louise Kelly Jan. 28, 2020  Ask journalists why they do the job they do, and youâ€™ll hear a range of answers.
Hereâ€™s mine: Not every day, but on the best ones, we get to put questions to powerful people and hold them to account.
This is both a privilege and a responsibility.
January has been an interesting month on this front.
Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to put questions, one on one, to the top diplomats of both the United States and Iran, in their respective capitals.
Iranâ€™s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, spoke to me on Jan. 7 in Tehran.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to me last Friday, in Washington.
Each man represents a nation in conflict with the other; speaking with them, I wondered what path either could see out of the situation.
In both cases, I was allotted 10 minutes for questions.
It turns out you can cover a lot of ground in 10 minutes.
When Mr. Zarif sat down with me, on the sidelines of a big think tank conference focused on security in the Persian Gulf, it was just four days after an American drone strike had killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani.
We started there.
How might Iran retaliate for General Suleimaniâ€™s death?
â€œThe United States has committed a grave error,â€ Mr. Zarif told me.
â€œAnd it will pay for that grave error.â€ I do not know whether, at that moment, he was aware that just hours later, Iran would unleash missiles on Iraqi military bases where American troops are housed.
We moved on to whether he would travel to New York later that week, to attend Security Council meetings at the United Nations.
â€œNo,â€ he told me, â€œbecause Mike Pompeo decided I was too dangerous for the United States.â€ The United States had denied Mr. Zarif a visa, in what some have branded a violation of the 1947 United Nations headquarters agreement, which generally requires the United States to grant access to the United Nations for foreign diplomats.
Next I asked whether we were witnessing the death of the 2015 nuclear deal.
Mr. Zarif insisted no â€” even as he acknowledged that Iran was suspending compliance with centrifuge limits.
The foreign minister and I ended with a tense exchange on what is an uncomfortable question for him: The status of United States citizens imprisoned in Iran, and whether future prisoner exchanges were off the table.
â€œWe had proposed a universal exchange of all prisoners and we were doing that in good faith,â€ Mr. Zarif said.
But are those channels still open?
No, he conceded, saying, â€œThose talks are certainly suspended now.â€  My interview with Secretary Pompeo came two weeks and three days later, in the East Hall of the Treaty Room, on the seventh floor of the State Department.
By then an uneasy pause had taken hold; the United States and Iran appeared, for the moment, to have stepped back from the brink of war.
I kicked off with a question on diplomacy.
Is there any serious initiative underway to reopen diplomacy with Iran?
â€œWeâ€™ve been engaged in deep diplomatic efforts since the first day of the Trump administration,â€ Mr. Pompeo replied, underlining American efforts to build a coalition to counter and contain Iran.
But in terms of American engagement with Iran, I went on, are there any plans for talks?
â€œThe diplomatic effort on this front has been vigorous, robust and enormously successful,â€ Mr. Pompeo said, changing the subject back to engaging American allies to put pressure on Iran.
Another question I was curious to hear Secretary Pompeo answer was how the Trump administration plans to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons, should it decide to do so, given that Iran is closer to a nuclear weapons capability than when President Trump took office.
Hereâ€™s the relevant portion of the interview:  KELLY: How do you stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon?
POMPEO: Weâ€™ll stop them.
KELLY: How?
Sanctions?
POMPEO: Weâ€™ll stop them.
He did not offer specifics.
Nor did he elaborate, when pressed on how to square his resolve with what Mr. Zarif had just told me â€” that all limits on Iranâ€™s centrifuge program have been suspended.
â€œYeah,â€ Mr. Pompeo said.
â€œHeâ€™s blustering.â€  Do you have evidence that heâ€™s blustering?
He did not directly answer.
(In fairness, I could hardly expect him to telegraph what intelligence the United States may possess on the Iranian regimeâ€™s nuclear ambitions.)
I write about all this now to refocus attention on the substance of the interviews, which has been overshadowed by Mr. Pompeoâ€™s subsequently swearing at me, calling me a liar and challenging me to find Ukraine on an unmarked map.
For the record, I did.
Thatâ€™s not the point.
The point is that recently the risk of miscalculation â€” of two old adversaries misreading each other and accidentally escalating into armed confrontation â€” has felt very real.
It occurs to me that swapping insults through interviews with journalists such as me might, terrifyingly, be as close as the top diplomats of the United States and Iran came to communicating this month.
There is a reason that freedom of the press is enshrined in the Constitution.
There is a reason it matters that people in positions of power â€” people charged with steering the foreign policy of entire nations â€” be held to account.
The stakes are too high for their impulses and decisions not to be examined in as thoughtful and rigorous an interview as is possible.
Journalists donâ€™t sit down with senior government officials in the service of scoring political points.
We do it in the service of asking tough questions, on behalf of our fellow citizens.
And then sharing the answers â€” or lack thereof â€” with the world.
Requiem for a Dream By Roger Cohen Jan. 31, 2020  I have covered many stories that marked me over the past 40 years, in war zones and outside them, but none that has affected me as personally as Britainâ€™s exit from the European Union.
Brexit Day, now upon us, feels like the end of hope, a moral collapse, a self-amputation that will make the country where I grew up poorer in every sense.
Poorer materially, of course, but above all poorer in its shriveled soul, divorced from its neighborhood, internally fractured, smaller, meaner, more insular, more alone, no longer a protagonist in the great miracle of the postwar years â€” Europeâ€™s journey toward borderless peace and union.
Britain, in a fit of deluded jingoism, has opted for littleness.
The fiasco was captured this week when that pompous and pitiful British nationalist, Nigel Farage, waved a miniature Union Jack in the European Parliament as he bid farewell and was cut off by the vice-president of the Parliament, Mairead McGuinness.
â€œPut your flags away, youâ€™re leaving, and take them with you,â€ she said.
Farage looked like a sheepish schoolboy caught breaking rules.
He blushed.
An Irish woman from a country uplifted by European Union membership reprimanding the new breed of little-England male as he exits history in pursuit of an illusion: the symbolism was perfect.
â€œHip, hip hooray!â€ Farageâ€™s flag-waving Brexit Party cohorts chanted.
Save me, please, for I shall weep.
Speaking of symbolism, the fact that President Trump has been a fulsome supporter of this folly is apt.
An ahistorical, amoral American leader cheering on a British abdication sums up the end of an era.
The world was rebuilt after 1945 on something of more substance than British-American lies and bloviation; it took resolve.
The torch has passed.
To whom exactly is unclear, perhaps to a country slow to contain a plague.
That is a problem.
Brexit belongs to this era in one quintessential way.
It is an act of the imagination, inspired by an imaginary past, carried along by misdirected grievances, borne aloft by an imaginary future.
The age of impunity is also the age of illusion turbocharged by social media.
Inequality, poor infrastructure, low investment, inadequate schools are real British problems but the take-back-your-country transference of blame for them onto â€œBrussels bureaucratsâ€ proved that the imagination now overwhelms reality.
Truth withers.
The mob roars.
This, too, is a problem.
Yes, Britain was undefeated in World War II and helped liberate Europe.
But it could do so only with its allies; and it was precisely to secure what it is now turning its back on: a free Europe offering its people the â€œsimple joys and hopes which make life worth living.â€ Those are Churchillâ€™s words in 1946 in a speech that also contained this phrase: â€œWe must build a kind of United States of Europe.â€ Unbowed Britain was once consequential Britain; no longer.
I used the word â€œabdicationâ€ advisedly.
Europe needs the great tradition of British liberalism at a moment when Hungary and Poland have veered toward nationalism and, across the Continent, xenophobic hatred is resurgent.
It is perverse for Britain to try to look away.
Europe is part of Britain.
Visit the great Norman monasteries in England and tell me this is not so.
The British dead who lie in the Continentâ€™s soil having given their lives for its liberty tell the same story of interlaced fate from a different perspective.
To be so orphaned is painful.
The 47 years of British membership cover the entire arc of my adult life.
Europa was our dream.
I covered Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian president, speaking to the European Parliament about hope and peace in 1981, eight months before his assassination.
So much for dreams.
Yet they persist, for otherwise life is unlivable.
I wandered from Brussels to Rome to Paris to Berlin to London and everywhere I lived I experienced some iteration of Europeâ€™s beauty, as a physical thing, as a cultural bond and as a transformative idea.
The sensation was most acute in Germany, where the idea of the union was the most effective escape from postwar shame and the rubble of 1945, a form of atonement.
But it was ubiquitous, the guarantor of our deliverance and the symbol of our capacity to reinvent the world and even make it better.
Every European country, through the goal of ever closer union, changed itself.
They grew richer, no small thing.
But they also reframed their self-image.
Italy and Spain left Mussolini and Franco behind to become stable, prosperous democracies.
France found its tortuous way to truth after the humiliations and predations of Vichy and discovered a European avenue to express once more its universal message of human rights founded on human dignity.
Central European countries stabilized their escape from the deadening Soviet imperium to which Yalta had confined them.
Britain ceased equating Europe with scourges like intellectuals, rabies and garlic, as it had in my childhood.
Hyde Park became a babble of European tongues.
The British economy surged.
Britain had given up its colonies and found a new identity in association with Europe, or so it seemed, flickeringly.
Then I lived in Sarajevo covering the Bosnian war and I saw, in inert bodies torn by shrapnel, and in history revived as galvanizing myth of might and conquest, the horror from which the European Union had saved my generation.
It had laid bad history to rest.
That was enough to be forever a European patriot.
But not enough for the British a quarter-century later.
In the words of my friend Ed Vulliamy, who also covered that war, Britain has become a country â€œthat boards cheap flights for stag outings to piss all over Krakow.â€  Hip, hip hooray!
When I lived in Berlin, I would cross the nearby Polish border and never failed to marvel that where millions had perished decades earlier a nonexistent frontier traced its invisible line across fields of wheat.
I would pass from the German world to the lands of the Slavs and nobody asked me who I was, what papers I bore or what was my intent.
If German-Polish reconciliation has been possible, anything is possible, my only solace at this moment.
A bunch of flag-waving fantasists, at the wrong end of actuarial tables, have robbed British youth of the Europe they embrace.
They will be looking on as 450 million Europeans across the way forge their fate.
Their automatic right to live and work anywhere from Lisbon to Stockholm will be lost.
Iâ€™ve lost a limb; more than a limb, my heart.
Europe helped Britain grow bigger and more open and more prosperous.
Now it will shrink.
Another suffering friend, Patrick Wintour, the diplomatic editor of The Guardian, sent me these lines of Auden:  In the nightmare of the dark  All the dogs of Europe bark,  And the living nations wait,  Each sequestered in its hate;  Intellectual disgrace  Stares from every human face,  And the seas of pity lie  Locked and frozen in each eye.
A better epitaph for the aborted story of Britain in Europe and the tragedy of a disoriented nationâ€™s willful infliction of enduring self-harm is impossible to imagine.
Senate Republicans Are Bathed in Shame By Frank Bruni Jan. 18, 2020  The impeachment trial of Donald John Trump began on Thursday when John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, directed all of the senators to stand and raise their right hands.
Ever since I canâ€™t get two questions out of my head.
The first: How in Godâ€™s name â€” and it was in Godâ€™s name â€” can the Republicans who have already decided to acquit President Trump take a solemn oath to administer â€œimpartial justiceâ€?
Theyâ€™re partial to the core, unabashedly so, as their united march toward a foregone conclusion shows.
A mind-meld this ironclad isnâ€™t a reflection of facts.
Itâ€™s a triumph of factionalism.
The majority of the partyâ€™s senators have said outright or clearly signaled that they have no intention of finding the president guilty and removing him from office.
Yapping lap dogs like Lindsey Graham and obedient manservants like Mitch McConnell have gone further, mocking the whole impeachment process.
So the oath they took: How does that work?
Did they cross the fingers on their left hands?
Do they reason that American politics has reached a nadir of such fundamental hypocrisy and overweening partisanship that no one regards that pledge as anything but window dressing?
Certainly theyâ€™re telling themselves that their own political survival, hinging on obsequiousness to a president with a talent for retribution, matters more than honor.
Over the three years of the Trump presidency, theyâ€™ve become expert at that calculation.
My second question is really a subset, corollary or anagram of the first: How can Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Martha McSally stand to look at themselves in the mirror?
Iâ€™m singling out these three somewhat randomly, but also because theyâ€™ve traveled particularly self-mortifying journeys away from self-respect.
At a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Senateâ€™s Democratic minority, said that when the chief justice walked into the chamber earlier that day, â€œI saw members on both sides of the aisle visibly gulp.â€ Schumer attributed that to the palpable â€œweight of history.â€ But for many of them, it probably had more to do with their awareness that they were about to sell out again, this time in circumstances that would be remembered long into the future.
Democrats, too, have made up their minds, and that would be equally upsetting but for the mountain of actual evidence on which their judgment rests.
You can erase all the testimony in the House by Gordon Sondland, David Holmes, Alexander Vindman, Fiona Hill and others.
You can delete Mick Mulvaneyâ€™s admission, at a White House news conference, of a quid pro quo.
You can discount Lev Parnasâ€™s ongoing aria of atonement.
Still you have the transcript (of sorts) of Trumpâ€™s â€œperfectâ€ phone call with the president of Ukraine, in which itâ€™s clear to any sane reader with a semblance of common sense that heâ€™s trying to trade American aid for the smearing of Joe Biden.
If there were nothing to this, why would Trump stonewall Congress to the extent that he has?
Thatâ€™s not how the innocent act.
When witness after witness tells a version of the same story, providing pieces of a puzzle that fit snugly together, you can reach a conclusion about the whole of it.
Thatâ€™s called logic.
And if the actual case against Trump were weak, why would Republicans keep redirecting attention to Democratsâ€™ motivations â€” to how much they despise the president?
Thatâ€™s called distraction.
McSally practiced it on Thursday when, in a moment of breathtaking hostility, she answered a reasonable question from Manu Raju of CNN about whether any new evidence should be presented during the Senate trial by snarling, â€œLiberal hack!â€  Sheâ€™s terrified.
Her state, Arizona, is increasingly purple.
She lost her 2018 race for the Senate and ended up in the chamber only by appointment following John McCainâ€™s death.
She has to run again this year, against Mark Kelly, the former astronaut, whoâ€™s a popular figure.
Sheâ€™s vulnerable, and standing with Trump is almost as much of a gamble as standing up to him would be.
But she once did stand up to him.
She used to have guts.
Before going into politics, she blazed trails as an Air Force pilot and even sued the secretary of defense when she detected discrimination against women.
During her successful campaign for the House in 2016, she pointedly didnâ€™t endorse Trump and just as pointedly spoke out against the behavior that he copped to â€” no, bragged about â€” in that infamous â€œAccess Hollywoodâ€ tape.
McSally had a moral compass then.
Now she just has a hunger to hold onto her suite of offices in the Capitol.
She has wagered that emulating Trump is her best bet.
At the conclusion of this pathetic excuse for a trial, sheâ€™ll vote to acquit him â€” impartially, of course.
Sheâ€™ll be joined by Cruz and Rubio, who are special targets of my disappointment because they were once special targets of Trumpâ€™s ugliness.
They know it firsthand and well.
They campaigned against him for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, when he didnâ€™t just criticize them but viciously belittled and even savaged them.
He conspiracy-theorized a role for Cruzâ€™s father in John F. Kennedyâ€™s assassination.
â€œA pathological liar,â€ Cruz called Trump.
But now that Trump is president and his base has become the most impassioned constituency in the party, Cruz is his biggest cheerleader and a ready mouthpiece for all of those lies.
He has swapped thoughts of 2016 for thoughts of 2024, when thereâ€™s another opportunity to reach for the White House and Trumpâ€™s loyalists will come in handy.
Heâ€™ll have to muscle aside Javanka and Don Jr., but thatâ€™s a pickle for another day.
First step: acquittal!
Rubio has long fashioned himself a foreign-policy maven and took a hard line when it came to Russia.
So you might think that the Trump presidency would be especially galling to him.
You might also think that Trumpâ€™s bullying of Ukraine â€” which left the country more vulnerable to Russian aggression â€” would be some sort of breaking point.
But heâ€™s a Republican member of Congress in 2020, which means heâ€™s a sycophantic shell of his former self.
And having bitten his tongue about Trumpâ€™s global misadventures, heâ€™ll now abet more of the same by helping Trump stay in office.
There are so many other Republican senators to marvel at.
Mitt Romney, what was the point of diving back into public life if youâ€™re going to prop up a president whose fraudulence you once gave a whole long speech about?
Lamar Alexander, you venerated Howard Baker, a fellow Tennessean who once held your Senate seat and put principle above partisanship by standing up to President Nixon.
Why not do the same and stand up to President Trump?
Susan Collins, I canâ€™t imagine the exhaustion of your role as political wild card, scrutinized to a fare-thee-well.
But come on.
If youâ€™re going to pride yourself on autonomy, you need to exercise it when it matters most.
Itâ€™s not fun to be any of you right now, with McConnell above you and #MAGA hellions below you poised to make your life a misery if you stray.
But no one forced you into public service.
When you entered the Senate, you took an oath, and you took another one on Thursday.
I have a third question, maybe just a rewording of the first and second: Doesnâ€™t that nag at you even a little?
â€˜Sesame Streetâ€™ Is Opening Up to Syrian Refugees By Alex Carp Jan. 31, 2020  In its 50 years on television, â€œSesame Streetâ€ has presented an expansive idea of the challenges of childhood, offering lessons on divorce, racism, grieving and autism â€” as well as help with the alphabet and accepting friends who are a bit taller and more birdlike.
Next week, a new version of the show will begin airing for an audience that, less than a decade ago, didnâ€™t exist: children displaced by the war in Syria and their neighbors in the communities where many of the refugees have fled or sought asylum.
â€œAt this point, there are lots of 7-year-olds who were born as refugees from Syriaâ€ and remain far from permanent resettlement, a staff member on the project said recently.
â€œThatâ€™s not changing soon.â€  Since the start of the conflict, in 2011, nearly seven of every 10 residents of Syria have been forced from their homes.
More than 11 million have fled to unfamiliar parts of Syria or to the countries across its borders, with only around 150,000 permanently resettled.
They are now the largest displaced population in the world.
And displacement, in the Middle East and elsewhere, lasts longer than ever before: â€œOnce refugees are displaced for at least five years, as is the case for most Syrian refugees,â€ the president of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, said at a Senate hearing last year, theyâ€™re likely to stay displaced for more than two decades.
â€œSesame Streetâ€ began as an experiment in television and became a global model for early-childhood education.
Its new project, launched with the I.R.C.
and educators in Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, is an effort to rethink humanitarian aid.
â€œAid is good at keeping people alive,â€ Mr. Miliband has argued.
â€œBut it doesnâ€™t give them the tools to thrive.â€ It has traditionally been directed to immediate needs â€” nutrition, security, shelter â€” but displacement that can last for decades presents a very different kind of problem.
Parents often carry the trauma of forced migration with them in unexpected ways, and a childhood of makeshift housing, isolation from an extended community of familiar faces, and few safe places to play can affect not only childrenâ€™s behavior and learning skills but also brain development, gene expression and the ability to build the fundamental tools of resiliency.
â€œIt can be very hard to moderate, or to cope,â€ said Sherrie Westin, Sesame Workshopâ€™s president of social impact and philanthropy.
Preliminary research conducted in Jordan and Lebanon found that displaced children have trouble finding the language to express their emotions.
They describe what they feel only very broadly: sad, happy, scared.
The show will focus on identifying and managing emotions, and will be coupled with thousands of outreach workers going to clinics, community centers, homes and other gathering spaces in the four countries, where they will meet with children, parents and caregivers to provide support and extend many lessons of the series.
Today, less than 2 percent of humanitarian aid worldwide is targeted at education, â€œand just a tiny fraction of that goes to early education,â€ Ms. Westin said.
â€œWeâ€™re talking about a generation-scale intervention.â€  Just as American â€œSesame Streetâ€ teaches counting and the alphabet before deeper literacy and numeracy, the new series, called â€œAhlan Simsim,â€ or â€œWelcome Sesame,â€ will start with the basics.
â€œWe want this first season to dive into identifying different emotions, like frustration and anger, nervousness and loneliness, fear,â€ Scott Cameron, an executive producer at Sesame Workshop, said.
â€œBut we also have to make that entertaining.
And we have to do that without, in the case of fear, terrifying the kids.â€  To do that, Mr. Cameron and his colleagues built on techniques developed throughout the programâ€™s years on the air.
â€œWe thought a lot about the iconic â€˜Sesameâ€™ characters whoâ€™ve been useful for curriculum goals in the past,â€ he said.
â€œWe need some kind of comedic foils, but we donâ€™t want to do negative modeling â€” we donâ€™t want villains.â€  â€œOscar the Grouch, for example, was developed in the very early stages of â€˜Sesameâ€™ as a way to represent differences, and a kind of mutual respect,â€ Mr. Cameron explained.
â€œHeâ€™s grumpy, and he thinks smelly fish are great.
But he can help model different perspectives.
Oscar and Grover and Cookie Monster are all monsters â€” meaning theyâ€™re not humanoid, like Bert and Ernie â€” so theyâ€™re a little bit removed from humans,â€ Mr. Cameron explained.
â€œYou get a little more leeway that way.â€  â€œAhlan Simsim,â€ which will air in Arabic and Kurdish, has two main characters.
Both were built at Jim Hensonâ€™s Creature Shop in Queens, where rows of desks are covered with half-constructed muppets and older ones midrepair.
(Muppets bigger than a desk â€” Mr. Snuffleupagus, for example â€” might lean against a wall.)
Jordan Pioneers Production Company, based in Jordan, collaborated with Sesame Workshop to develop the characters, write scripts and shoot the episodes.
When producers from â€œSesameâ€ made a series of visits to the Creature Shop last year to discuss muppet design and look at prototypes, Zaid Baqaeen and Khaled Haddad of Jordan Pioneers, the showâ€™s head writer and an executive producer, joined from Amman via video chat.
â€œJordan Pioneers pitched us a boy and a girl character that were roughly the same age, and we loved that,â€ Mr. Cameron said.
â€œTwo new friends who go on adventures together.â€ For names, they suggested Basma and Jad.
â€œBasma means smile, and Jad has a bunch of meanings, but connotes somebody whoâ€™s kind of generous but a little bit buttoned up.
Very earnest.â€  Mr. Baqaeen added: â€œCompletely different, but they complement each other.
Basma is dynamic, adventurous, go-go-go.
Sheâ€™s kind of impatient when sheâ€™s excited about an idea or a challenge that she wants to take on.
Jad, we think of him as the planner, meticulous.â€ Heâ€™s a painter, and he likes to paint plans in midair; viewers will learn that his brush once belonged to his grandfather, who is absent from the show.
What Basma should look like came relatively easily â€” a purple non-humanoid girl (â€œLike Elmo is a boy, but not necessarily a human boy,â€ Mr. Cameron explained.)
Skewed pigtails, oval face, no bracelets or jewelry.
And no clothing, which can bring in local connotations that interfere with a characterâ€™s identity.
It can also be hard to adjust: Bert and Ernie have been stuck in striped shirts since 1969.
Jad was trickier.
The team passed around some early sketches.
â€œWe dragged a whole bunch of our monster muppets out,â€ said Rollie Krewson, a master builder at the Creature Shop.
She and Jason Weber, the Creature Shopâ€™s New York creative supervisor and an expert fabric painter and dyer, call them â€œanything muppetsâ€ â€” on occasion, they sit in for firefighters or police officers in the background of a scene, or once, for Elmoâ€™s grandmother.
â€œWe had one in a drawer that sounded like what they were describing, just character-wise,â€ Mr. Weber said.
â€œIt has this beautiful roundish head, and the mouth is straight across, but when you change the angle to make eye contact with the viewer, you can start to see a friendly, open smile just underneath.â€  Ms. Krewson adjusted the design to communicate Jadâ€™s introversion and express the challenges he sometimes has letting his feelings out.
â€œHe can also look very contemplative,â€ she said.
â€œHeâ€™s got a very loose jaw.
I can push it way forward, and I can pull his chin back, so he can look perplexed and sad, more internal.â€  Mr. Weber added, â€œHe has what we call a very good smile curve.â€ Smaller touches link the characters visually.
Jadâ€™s nose is purple, like Basmaâ€™s, and Basmaâ€™s nose is Jadâ€™s golden yellow.
The pair is joined by Maâ€™zooza, a goat sidekick who provides comic relief, mostly by eating everything in sight.
â€œSheâ€™s a baby, learning how to walk and climb, and sheâ€™s voracious,â€ in the tradition of Cookie Monster, Mr. Cameron said.
â€œCookie has trouble with self-regulation, self-control.
And Maâ€™zooza allows Basma and Jad, who are almost 6, to have a younger friend that they can nurture, so theyâ€™re not always the ones being nurtured.
She also has these long, floppy ears, which are adorable.â€  Ms. Westin said that â€œwith Basma and Jad, one has left his home, becomes best friends with someone from somewhere else.
You can see where that creates opportunities for children to relate to those stories and feel less alone.â€ Most refugee families live in host communities and neighborhoods, and â€œthe benefit of mass media is that we know we can reach not only displaced Syrian children, but we can reach them side by side with their new neighbors.â€  Before shooting could begin, Basma, Jad and Maâ€™zooza were bagged, packed in boxes and shipped to Amman.
Sesame estimates that the project, through television, mobile phones, home visits, preschools and the efforts of educators across the region, will reach as many as nine million children â€” what they expect to be the largest early-childhood intervention in the history of humanitarian response.
To measure its effectiveness with parents, caregivers and on TV, childhood development specialists will design and conduct studies during the projectâ€™s first five years.
Their work will double the amount of research available on the experience of childhood in humanitarian crisis.
â€œWeâ€™re going to share what works and what doesnâ€™t work, and not just to help us achieve the outcomes weâ€™re setting out to achieve here,â€ Ms. Westin said.
It will be one of the first projects of its scale to think about how fuller lives might be lived within the consequences of the conflict and within long-term crises elsewhere.
â€œWe want this project to be a model for humanitarian response not just in the Middle East,â€ Ms. Westin added, â€œbut for refugee children wherever they may be.â€ Starr Chamber: The Sequel By Maureen Dowd Jan. 18, 2020  Can a woman be president of the United States?
Hell, yes.
Iâ€™ve covered the men who run the world my whole life.
And there have been a lot of screw-ups, from Vietnam to Watergate to Afghanistan to Iraq to pushing the economy off a cliff.
There has also been plenty of creepy behavior, culminating in the news that Donald Trump, Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz have joined together in a pervy, hypocritical cabal to argue that Trump did not smirch the Constitution.
So please, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, stop whingeing about sexism and just show how you could wield power like a boss.
Ibid: Nancy Pelosi.
When Steve Bannon called Pelosi a â€œtotal assassin,â€ according to the hot new book â€œA Very Stable Genius,â€ by Washington Post writers Phil Rucker and Carol Leonnig, he meant it as the highest compliment.
You wonâ€™t find Pelosi keening about gender; sheâ€™s too busy taking care of business.
Hillary Clinton did not lose because she was a woman.
She faced sexism, of course, just as Barack Obama faced racism.
She lost because she ran an entitled, joyless, nose-in-the air campaign and because she didnâ€™t emulate her husbandâ€™s ethos of campaign â€™til the last dog dies and the last bowling alley closes, and always make it about the voters.
She lost because she and her campaign manager, Robby Mook, didnâ€™t listen to Bill Clinton, the worldâ€™s leading expert on the white, male, rural vote, when he warned them that there was trouble and offered to help out.
Donald Trump operates from the id, which is fitting because he represents a last-gasp primal scream from working-class Americans threatened by the changes transforming the country.
Women are now a majority of the work force and whites are heading toward a minority status.
Hollywood cannot cling to its benighted â€” and self-defeating â€” desire to stay a white male club forever, despite the fact that women have always made up half the audience.
Trumpâ€™s ascent does not make it harder for women to ascend â€” just the opposite.
Look at the throng of women who were outraged enough about Trump to march and run and get elected in 2018.
Once a woman electrifies Democrats the way J.F.K., Bill Clinton and Obama did â€” and the way Trump does his base â€” she will win.
Trump is once more doing his part to energize women voters.
On Friday, we learned that the president will get help from Starr and Dershowitz for the impeachment trial in the Senate.
The Starr chamber was a shameful period of American history, with the prissy Puritan independent counsel hounding and virtually jailing Monica Lewinsky and producing hundreds of pages of panting, bodice-ripping prose that read more like bad erotica than a federal report, rife with lurid passages about breasts, stains and genitalia.
Like the Rev.
Arthur Dimmesdale and other Pharisaic Holy Rollers before him, the prosecutor who read the Bible and sang hymns when he jogged became fixated on sex in an unhealthy, warped way.
Even Trump was appalled.
â€œStarrâ€™s a freak,â€ the bloviating builder told me back in 1999. â€œI bet heâ€™s got something in his closet.â€ In other interviews, he called Starr â€œa lunatic,â€ â€œa disasterâ€ and â€œoff his rocker,â€ and expressed sympathy for Hillary having to stand by her man when he was â€œbeing lambasted by this crazy Ken Starr, who is a total wacko.â€  Starr, who once clutched his pearls over Bill Clintonâ€™s sexual high jinks, is now going to bat for President â€œAccess Hollywood.â€ After playing an avenging Javert about foreplay in the Oval, Starr will now do his utmost to prove that a real abuse of power undermining Congress and American foreign policy is piffle.
In 2007, he defended Jeffrey Epstein.
By 2016, Starr was being ousted as president of Baptist Baylor University for failing to protect women and looking the other way when football players were accused and sometimes convicted of sexual assaults.
In other words, heâ€™s a complete partisan hack who doesnâ€™t give a damn about sexual assault.
And then thereâ€™s Dershowitz, whose past clients have included such sterling fellows as Epstein, Claus von BÃ¼low, O.J.
Simpson and Harvey Weinstein.
How did he miss Ted Bundy?
Still, Dershowitz has put himself on the side of an impressive pantheon of villainy in the realm of violence against girls and women.
Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrewâ€™s accuser, has also claimed that she was offered as a teenager to Dershowitz for sex â€” a contention that Dershowitz has denied in a countersuit.
On Fox News, Dershowitz has made the case that it is Pelosi who put herself above the law by delaying the delivery of the articles of impeachment.
Good luck with that one.
The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan government watchdog, a few days ago deemed that Trumpâ€™s slimy Ukraine gambit violated a law.
Yet Dershowitz will somehow argue that it doesnâ€™t represent high crimes and misdemeanors.
He tweeted that heâ€™s nonpartisan because he opposed Billâ€™s impeachment and voted for Hillary, even as he joined up with Billâ€™s persecutor.
Dershowitz said that he is participating â€œto defend the integrity of the Constitution.â€  That assertion may fly in Foxworld.
But in the real world, itâ€™s ridiculous.
You can bet that Trump and his buddies will continue to turn out the womenâ€™s vote.
Steve Jobs Was Right: Smartphones and Tablets Killed the P.C.
By Farhad Manjoo Nov. 13, 2019  I got an iPad Pro recently, and Iâ€™ve fallen madly in love with it.
This was unexpected.
Iâ€™ve had iPads before, but like a lot of people, I hadnâ€™t found them to be very useful.
Tablets were good for surfing the Web and watching Netflix, but theyâ€™ve always been dogged by the charge that you couldnâ€™t get a lot of work done on them.
Appleâ€™s latest iPads are different.
Not only can you get work done on them; in many ways theyâ€™re productivity dream machines.
Todayâ€™s iPads are powered by custom-designed processors that are faster than the chips on some of the Macs Apple makes, and the iPadâ€™s separately sold keyboard is better and more durable than the accursed, falling-apart mess of a keyboard that Apple is shipping on its much-maligned current line of laptops.
Apple unveiled a new 16-inch MacBook with a revamped keyboard on Wednesday, good news for the many Apple lovers whoâ€™ve been grumbling about the companyâ€™s lackluster slate of recent Macs.
But I think the iPad is already beginning to eclipse the traditional personal computer.
In the four months Iâ€™ve had this latest model, the iPad Pro has eaten into the time I spend on my phone and my old-school laptop and desktop.
Among other things, I now research and write just about every column using an iPad (I still compose many first drafts by speaking into my headphones, but Iâ€™m an odd duck).
I thought I had gotten out of the gadget-reviewing business for good last year.
Since the smartphone had gobbled up everything from cameras to music players to portable gaming systems, I declared the whole field of gadgetry dead.
But just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in.
The history of the iPad is a story about consolidation, focus and the power of scale in the tech business.
Itâ€™s a story about how thoroughly one company, Apple, has dominated the entire hardware business this decade.
And it is also, really, a story about the only thing that mattered in tech in the 2010s â€” the smartphone â€” and the way that one device became the gravitational center of the entire tech business, shaping every market in the industry, and much of the non-tech world beyond it.
The iPad has always been freighted with great expectations.
Although the iPad was unveiled in 2010, three years after the iPhone, development of the iPad predated development of the phone, and Steve Jobs, Appleâ€™s co-founder, always seemed to have his heart in the tablet.
In one of his last interviews before his death in 2011, Jobs declared the iPad to be the future of computing.
â€œPCs are going to be like trucks,â€ he told the journalists Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg â€” meaning the traditional Mac and Windows machines would still be around, but like big rigs, theyâ€™d be used by a small set of power users for a dwindling set of specific, high-power tasks.
The â€œcarsâ€ of the tech industry, as Jobs saw it, would be phones and tablets.
For a while, he was only partially right.
The iPad sold well at launch, but after a few years it hit some hurdles.
After Jobsâ€™s death, Apple left the iPad to languish, and did something similar with the Mac.
Meanwhile, something amazing happened with the iPhone and the many Android-based copycat phones it inspired.
In the 2010s, smartphones became more popular, more powerful and more profitable than anyone in the tech industry thought possible.
Within a few years, their sales and usage eclipsed that of PCs, and for much of the decade they were the fountain of most new consumer innovations across the technology industry.
Smartphones made Uber and Instagram and Snapchat and TikTok possible.
Smartphone cameras began to surpass stand-alone cameras, turning much of culture and society into a meme-soaked playground where visual media matters more than text.
The smartphone also altered the business dynamics of the tech industry.
When the iPhone came out, Apple was just one of many successful hardware companies in the world.
But the smartphone decimated a host of phone brands (remember Nokia?
Motorola?
), and as smartphones gained more power, they began making life impossible for a slate of hardware start-ups, from GoPro to Jawbone.
On the strength of the iPhone, Apple began capturing a greater and greater slice of the tech hardware business; although it didnâ€™t sell a majority of units, its commitment to the high end of the market allowed it to make the bulk of profits.
In the last quarter of 2017, according to one estimate, Apple made 86 percent of profits in the smartphone industry.
Appleâ€™s dominance came despite the fact that the company made some big mistakes and was late to many big innovations.
Samsung, not Apple, invented huge-screen phones.
Appleâ€™s Mac line was plagued by delays and dead ends, including a 2013 redesign of the Mac Pro that looked like a trash can and proved just as useful.
And on the iPad, for many years, Apple just seemed to fall asleep.
The iPadâ€™s stylus and keyboard-forward design?
Microsoft did it first on the Surface.
Yet none of this mattered.
Because of its hold on the smartphone business and a very sticky software ecosystem that users found hard to leave, Apple has been able to incorporate many innovations pioneered elsewhere and sell its customers on a series of peripheral billion-dollar businesses, including the Apple Watch and AirPods.
And ultimately, itâ€™s the ecosystem that explains why I canâ€™t stop raving about the iPad.
When it came out, the big knock on the iPad was that it was just a big phone; today, thatâ€™s what I love about it â€” like the Watch or AirPods, the iPad feels intuitive and natural to me because it works just like the device I use most often, my phone.
Like a phone, in most scenarios I find the iPad to be faster, more portable and easier to use and maintain than any traditional P.C.
Iâ€™ve ever owned.
The iPadâ€™s limited screen space and emphasis on full-screen apps also makes for fewer distractions than on a traditional personal computer.
The iPad, like my phone, lets me log in to my bank using my face; the Mac, in 2019, doesnâ€™t even have a touch screen.
The iPad still canâ€™t do everything a laptop can, and I still have to log in to a â€œrealâ€ computer sometimes.
I had a long chat recently with Dan Seifert, the deputy editor of the Verge, who uses an iPad every day on the subway but often finds the device infuriating.
â€œFor someone like me, whoâ€™s been using a desktop operating system for a long time, thereâ€™s a lot of built-in conventions that Iâ€™m used to that can be frustrating,â€ Seifert said.
In particular, the iPad doesnâ€™t work with antiquated work flows that are built for PCs.
Say you need to log into your companyâ€™s bespoke publishing system or expense program?
Itâ€™s possible those wonâ€™t work on your iPad â€” at least not yet â€” because they were built for much older devices.
But Seifert agreed with me that many of these uses are a special case.
He still uses P.C.s because often, in Jobsâ€™s parlance, he needs a truck.
Most people, however, donâ€™t need trucks, and few of us will need them in the future.
Seifert isnâ€™t teaching his kids how to use desktop operating systems like the Mac or Windows, and neither am I.
It took longer than he expected, but Steve Jobs was right.
Over the past decade, for most people, in most use cases, phones killed the P.C.
To get work done, now you just use a big phone â€” which Apple happens to call an iPad.
Tech Loses a Prophet.
Just When It Needs One.
By Kara Swisher Jan. 29, 2020  Itâ€™s nothing but noise, all the time.
We get hammered every second from an incessant sousaphone of tweets and from the righteous rage machine that screams at us in this digitized 24/7/365 communications world that we have built.
What you might not know is that we have long had a name for what started this all: â€œdisruptive innovation.â€ The concept was pioneered by Clay Christensen, a high-profile and well-regarded Harvard professor of management who died of cancer last week at 67.
Professor Christensenâ€™s remarkable legacy grew out of a seminal book he published in 1997, â€œThe Innovatorâ€™s Dilemma.â€  The book covered esoteric industries like the disk drives market and excavating to analyze and illustrate the power of disruptive technologies.
His ideas exploded through the then-nascent internet scene and throughout Silicon Valley.
I recall reading an early copy and thinking that it was a manifesto that the tech world would embrace â€” and that Professor Christensen was techâ€™s prophet.
The Intel founder and chief executive Andy Grove was a fan.
So was the Apple legend Steve Jobs.
Both men were doubtlessly attracted to the idea that start-ups made up of outsiders could find ways to create new markets and new value â€” and disrupt and overwhelm established companies.
In the face of disruption, older companies could do almost nothing.
It wasnâ€™t that they couldnâ€™t see the new threats of start-ups, but that they were stuck on serving their current businesses, and they failed to change their products and services out of fear of cutting into profits.
Professor Christensenâ€™s formula was elegant: â€œFirst, disruptive products are simpler and cheaper; they generally promise lower margins, not greater profits.
Second, disruptive technologies typically are first commercialized in emerging or insignificant markets.
And third, leading firmsâ€™ most profitable customers generally donâ€™t want, and indeed initially canâ€™t use, products based on disruptive technologies.â€  It was that simple.
Professor Christensenâ€™s book came out a year before Google was founded, seven years before Facebook, eight years before YouTube and 11 years before Uber.
Each of these companies, knowingly or unknowingly, would follow his map.
While Professor Christensen would go on to write a sequel and many more books on adjacent topics ripe for disruption, like education (â€œDisrupting Classâ€ in 2008) and health care (â€œInnovatorâ€™s Prescriptionâ€ in 2009), it was his initial idea that was devastatingly insightful.
I use the term devastate because, though no fault of Professor Christensenâ€™s, disruptive innovation took a turn for the worse in tech.
Silicon Valley failed to marry disruption with a concept of corporate responsibility, and growth at all costs became its motto.
The more measured approach that Professor Christensen taught was ignored.
Thus, in tech, the idea was more like â€œdestructive innovation,â€ which to me was distilled in Facebookâ€™s famous sign that was once plastered all over the walls at its headquarters: â€œMove Fast and Break Things.â€  I have always wondered why the company chose those words.
I have no problem with â€œmove fast,â€ which Professor Christensen would not have quibbled with, since being nimble was a core competency that he touted.
It was the word â€œbreakâ€ that stuck in my head like a bad migraine.
Why use a violent and thoughtless word like â€œbreakâ€ and not one more hopeful, like â€œchangeâ€ or â€œtransformâ€ or â€œinventâ€?
And, if â€œbreakâ€ was to be the choice, what would happen after the breaking?
Would there be fixing?
Could there be any fixing after the breaking?
â€œBreakâ€ sounded painful.
And, back to todayâ€™s subject, Professor Christensen never talked about that.
In fact, Professor Christensenâ€™s approach was quite the opposite.
He learned in 2010 that he had lymphoma, then he had a stroke.
Within two years, he published the book that I like best, titled â€œHow Will You Measure Your Life?â€ It is at turns spiritual and sometimes self-helpy, taking Professor Christensenâ€™s management thinking and applying it to how to live a life.
This book should be newly relevant, as tech is casting about for its next act; weâ€™ve been talking about the negative impact of techâ€™s disruptive innovations for a while now.
Techies measure everything â€” and so Professor Christensenâ€™s bracing prescriptions are perhaps perfect as the tech industry seeks redemption.
For example, he wrote:  â€œItâ€™s easier to hold your principles 100 percent of the time than it is to hold them 98 percent of the time.â€  And: â€œIn fact, how you allocate your own resources can make your life turn out to be exactly as you hope or very different from what you intend.â€  And, most of all: â€œDecide what you stand for.
And then stand for it all the time.â€  Perhaps the tech industry does not deserve the kind and good advice that Professor Christensen imparted, but it should take it anyway.
That way, while he rests in peace, it could give us some, too.
That Beloved Hospital?
Itâ€™s Driving Up Health Care Costs By Elisabeth Rosenthal Sept. 1, 2019  As voters fume about the high cost of health care, politicians have been targeting two well-deserved villains: pharmaceutical companies, whose prices have risen more than inflation, and insurers, who pay their executives millions in salaries while raising premiums and deductibles.
But while the Democratic presidential candidates have devoted copious airtime to debating health care, many of the countryâ€™s leading health policy experts have wondered why they have given a total pass to arguably a primary culprit behind runaway medical inflation: Americaâ€™s hospitals.
Data shows that hospitals are by far the biggest cost in our $3.5 trillion health care system, where spending is growing faster than gross domestic product, inflation and wage growth.
Spending on hospitals represents 44 percent of personal expenses for the privately insured, according to Rand.
A report this year from researchers at Yale and other universities found that hospital prices increased a whopping 42 percent from 2007 to 2014 for inpatient care and 25 percent for outpatient care, compared with 18 percent and 6 percent for physicians.
So why have politicians on both the left and right let hospitals off scot-free?
Because a web of ties binds politicians to the health care system.
Every senator, virtually every congressman and every mayor of every large city has a powerful hospital system in his or her district.
And those hospitals are as politically untouchable as soybean growers in Iowa or oil producers in Texas.
As hospitals and hospital systems have consolidated, they have become the biggest employers in numerous cities and states.
They have replaced manufacturing as the hometown industry in a number of rust-belt cities, including Cleveland and Pittsburgh.
Can Kamala Harris ignore the requests of Sutter Health, Kaiser Permanente, U.C.L.A.
or any of the big health care systems in California?
Can Elizabeth Warren ignore the needs of Partners HealthCare, Bostonâ€™s behemoth?
(Bernie Sanders may be somewhat different on this front because Vermont doesnâ€™t have any nationally ranked hospitals.)
Beyond that, hospitals are often beloved by constituents.
Itâ€™s easy to get voters riled up about a drug maker in Silicon Valley or an insurer in Hartford.
Itâ€™s much riskier to try to direct their venom at the place where their children were born; that employed their parents as nurses, doctors and orderlies; that sponsored local Little League teams; that was associated with their Catholic Church.
And, of course, thereâ€™s election money.
Hospital trade groups, medical centers and their employees are major political donors, contributing to whichever party holds power â€” and often to the out-of-power party as well.
In 2018, PACs associated with the Greater New York Hospital Association, and individuals linked to it, gave $4.5 million to the Democratsâ€™ Senate Majority PAC and $1 million to their House Majority PAC.
Its chief lobbyist personally gave nearly a quarter of a million dollars to dozens of campaigns last year.
Senator Sanders has called on his competitors for the Democratic nomination to follow his lead and reject contributions from pharma and insurance.
Can any candidate do the same for hospitals?
The campaign committees of all 10 candidates participating in the upcoming Democratic debate have plentiful donations linked to the hospital and health care industry, according to Open Secrets.
But the symbiosis between hospitals and politicians operates most insidiously in the subtle fueling of each otherâ€™s interests.
Zack Cooper, a health economist at Yale, and his colleagues looked at this life cycle of influence by analyzing how members of Congress voted for a Medicare provision that allowed hospitals to apply to have their government payments increased.
Hospitals in districts of members who voted yea got more money than hospitals whose representatives voted nay, to the collective tune of $100 million.
They used that money to hire more staff and increase payroll.
They also spent millions lobbying to extend the program.
Members who voted yea in turn received a 25 percent increase in total campaign contributions and a 65 percent increase in contributions from individuals working in the health care industry in their home states.
It was a win-win for both sides.
To defend their high prices, medical centers assert that they couldnâ€™t afford to operate on Medicare payments, which are generally lower than what private insurers pay.
But the argument isnâ€™t convincing.
The cost of a hospital stay in the United States averaged $5,220 a day in 2015 â€” and could be as high as over $17,000, compared with $765 in Australia.
In a Rand study published earlier this year, researchers calculated that hospitals treating patients with private health insurance were paid, overall, 2.4 times the Medicare rates in 2017, and nearly three times the rate for outpatient care.
If the plans had paid according to Medicareâ€™s formula, their spending would be reduced by over half.
Most economists think hospitals could do just fine with far less than they get today from private insurance.
While on paper many hospitals operate on the thinnest of margins, that is in part a choice, resulting from extravagance.
It would be unseemly for these nonprofit medical centers to make barrels of money.
So when their operations generate huge surpluses â€” as many big medical centers do â€” they plow the money back into the system.
They build another cancer clinic, increase C.E.O.
pay, buy the newest scanner (whether it is needed or not) or install spas and Zen gardens.
Some rural hospitals are genuinely struggling.
But many American hospitals have been spending capital â€œlike water,â€ said Kevin Schulman a physician-economist at Stanford.
The high cost of hospitals today, he said, is often a function of the cost of new infrastructure or poor management decisions.
â€œMedicare is supposed to pay the cost of an efficient hospital,â€ he said.
â€œIf theyâ€™ve made bad decisions, why should we keep paying for that?â€  If hospitals were paid less via regulation or genuine competition, they would look different, and theyâ€™d make different purchasing decisions about technology.
But would that matter to medical results?
Compared with their European counterparts, some American hospitals resemble seven-star hotels.
And yet, on average, the United States doesnâ€™t have better outcomes than other wealthy nations.
By some measures â€” such as life expectancy and infant mortality â€” it scores worse than average.
As attorney general in California, Kamala Harris in 2012 initiated an antitrust investigation into hospitalsâ€™ high charges.
But as a senator and presidential candidate, she has been largely silent on the issue â€” as have all the other candidates.
As Uwe Reinhardt, the revered Princeton health economist who died in 2017, told me, â€œIf you want to save money, you have to pay less.â€ That means taking on hospital pricing.
So fine, go after drug makers and insurers.
And for good measure, attack the device makers who profit from huge markups, and the pharmacy benefit managers â€” the middlemen who negotiate drug prices down for insurers, then keep the difference for themselves.
But with Congress returning to Washington in the coming days and a new Democratic debate less than two weeks away, our elected officials need to address the elephant in the room and tell us how they plan to rein in hospital excesses.
Beware the Pandemic Panic By Farhad Manjoo Jan. 29, 2020  Coronavirus is starting to freak me out â€” not the illness itself but the amped-up, ill-considered way our frightened world might respond to it.
Yes, the novel virus appears to be spreading quickly at the outbreakâ€™s epicenter in the Chinese province of Hubei, but after a late start the Chinese government is now imposing unprecedented measures to contain it.
As the World Health Organization declared last week, it remains too early to call the outbreak a global public health emergency.
So far, the Wuhan coronavirus is not much more frightening than the outbreaks of other recent coronaviruses like SARS in 2003 or MERS in 2012, each of which killed fewer than a thousand people around the world.
The new virusâ€™s death toll has just exceeded 130; for context, according to the CDC, about 15 million Americans have been sickened by the seasonal flu so far in the 2019-2020 flu season, and 8,200 have died from it.
(The flu kills between 300,000 and 650,000 people around the world annually.)
What worries me more than the new disease is that fear of a vague and terrifying new illness might spiral into panic, and that it might be used to justify unnecessarily severe limits on movement and on civil liberties, especially of racial and religious minorities around the world.
I also worry that the online world may give rise to dangerous skepticism, and that in the event of an actual pandemic a large number of people may delay treatment or refuse vaccines because they donâ€™t believe the science or are suspicious of the government.
â€œI predict that the next major outbreak â€” whether of a highly fatal strain of influenza or something else â€” will not be due to a lack of preventive technologies,â€ warned Heidi Larson, the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project, in a 2018 article in the journal Nature.
â€œInstead, emotional contagion, digitally enabled, could erode trust in vaccines so much as to render them moot.â€ Social media, she added, â€œshould be recognized as a global public-health threat.â€  Tech giants have been racing to tamp down conspiracy theories and hoaxes about the Wuhan virus, but I worry that their efforts wonâ€™t be very successful, because society seems to have no good answer to the kind of emotional contagion Dr. Larson describes.
Itâ€™s not just that many people get their news from a medium given to rumor, exaggeration and wild misinformation, especially on issues about health or science â€” see the persistence of antivaxers or climate-change deniers.
There is also a growing partisan divide over how Americans interpret scientific expertise and health policy, leaving decisions about public health vulnerable to the kind of partisan squabbling you hear on cable news every night.
I also worry about the hair-trigger state of geopolitics.
From Donald Trump to Xi Jinping to Boris Johnson, strongmen with authoritarian tendencies run many of the worldâ€™s most powerful governments.
It is worth remembering that disease, or the fear of disease, can bring out the worst in humanity â€” pandemics often feed scapegoating (Jews were widely blamed for the Black Death), creating a fertile field for demagogues.
When you put all these factors together, youâ€™ve got a dangerous recipe for global repression.
Already, Chinaâ€™s response appears to be driven by political considerations more than epidemiological ones.
The government has imposed a travel lockdown on more than 35 million people, which experts say is a quarantine of unprecedented size and scale, yet it may not even turn out to be very effective.
Experts say that quarantines work best during the earliest stages of an outbreak, but that they can also backfire, causing medical shortages, corroding trust in health officials and pushing some people to look to evade care to escape any restriction on their rights.
China took weeks to mount a full-scale response to the virus.
According to Wuhanâ€™s mayor, five million people left the city before restrictions were imposed, suggesting the country is effectively locking the barn door after the horse has run off.
â€œTheyâ€™re doing it because people who are in political leadership always think that if you do something dramatic and visible that youâ€™ll gain popular support,â€ Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, told The Washington Post.
â€œThey couldnâ€™t have any sound public health advice.â€  We should keep this sense of caution in mind in case American politicians begin pushing for travel bans, overbroad quarantines or other measures that might not be supported by the science.
You might wonder what the great harm is â€” if the government needs to temporarily limit peopleâ€™s movements or prevent some people from entering the country, shouldnâ€™t it take those measures in the face of dangerous illness?
Perhaps, but given the checkered history of quarantines â€” throughout history, they have been used to persecute the marginalized â€” lawmakers and the media should rigorously examine the bases for any such restrictions.
We should especially make sure any restrictions imposed are indeed temporary and adhere to the science â€” something we donâ€™t always do.
Consider that 30 years after the AIDS outbreak, men who have sex with men are still restricted from donating blood in the United States, long after the scientific basis for such a ban has passed.
So far, President Trump has offered a measured response to the virus.
â€œWe have it totally under control,â€ he said this week.
But online, misinformation about the scale of the virus is already trending.
(It is not, as you might have read on Twitter, â€œthermonuclear pandemic level bad.â€) So are racist memes blaming Chinese people and Chinese culture for the virus.
I fear that the conditions are ripe for a situation similar to what occurred in the summer of 2014, when an outbreak of Ebola overran West Africa.
After the Obama administration scrambled to bring home two American health workers who had become infected with the disease in Liberia, Trump went on a monthslong Twitter tirade about Ebola.
The future president favored extreme isolationism, seeing no benefit to American help in Africa.
â€œPeople that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences!â€ he wrote â€” ultimately sparking a growing partisan movement against the governmentâ€™s response to the virus.
Today, Trump runs an administration that is hemorrhaging scientific expertise, and his political agenda is rife with efforts to target immigrants, minorities and the poor.
In 2016, a terrorist attack prompted Trump to propose banning Muslims from the country; when he won the White House, he instituted a version of that ban.
I fear that panic about a foreign virus offers society another chance to target marginalized people.
So letâ€™s keep our fear in check; panic will hurt us far more than itâ€™ll help.
The American Health Care Industry Is Killing People By Farhad Manjoo Dec. 4, 2019  Wonâ€™t you spare a thought for Americaâ€™s medical debt collectors?
And while youâ€™re at it, will you say a prayer for the nationâ€™s health care billing managers?
Letâ€™s also consider the kindly, economically productive citizens in swing states whose job it is to jail pregnant women and the parents of cancer patients for failing to pay their radiology bills.
Put yourself in the entrepreneurial shoes of the friendly hospital administrator who has found a lucrative new revenue stream: filing thousands of lawsuits to garnish sick peopleâ€™s wages.
And who can forget the lawyers?
And the lobbyists!
Oh, arenâ€™t they all having a ball in Americaâ€™s health care thunderdome.
Like the two lobbyists who were just caught drafting newspaper editorials for state representatives in Montana and Ohio, decrying their partyâ€™s push toward a â€œgovernment-controlledâ€ health care industry.
Itâ€™s clear why these lobbyists might prefer the converse status quo: a government controlled by the health care industry.
If we moved to a single-payer system, how would lobbyists put food on the table, and who would write lawmakersâ€™ op-ed essays?
Welcome to the bizarre new argument against â€œMedicare for allâ€: Itâ€™s going to cost us jobs.
Lots of jobs.
Good, middle-class, white-collar jobs in Americaâ€™s heartland, where Democrats need to win big to defeat Donald Trump.
The argument is specious and morally suspect.
Last week, health researchers reported that American life expectancy is declining for the first time in half a century, and some of the leading causes have to do with the ruinous health care system.
Even if it is the case that reforming American health care might eliminate some jobs, it would seem to be a good trade for the likely benefit: More people might gain access to affordable health care and get to keep living.
But I worry that the jobs argument might sway moderate politicians, centrist pundits and much of the establishment, because it plays on one of the major fault lines of health reform: that in fixing the system so that more people benefit, those who now enjoy a privileged slice of American health care might end up worse off than they are today.
As a matter of ethics and equality, this should be O.K.
; sticking with a system that is the source of so much death, debt and financial ruin just because you like your doctor or your insurance company or your medical-billing job is not really a defensible position.
On the other hand, in America, â€œIâ€™ve got mine and I donâ€™t want to lose itâ€ is always pretty good politics.
The jobs argument goes like this: Thereâ€™s a lot of fat in the American health care industry, and any effort to transform it into a simpler system in which everyone is covered would necessarily eliminate layers of bureaucracy and likely reduce overhead costs.
Every year Americans collectively pay about $500 billion in administrative costs for health care â€” that is, for things like billing and insurance overhead, not for actual medical care.
These costs are significantly higher than in most other wealthy countries.
One study on health care data from 1999 showed that each American paid about $1,059 per year just in overhead costs for health care; in Canada, the per capita cost was $307.
Those figures are likely much higher today.
Wouldnâ€™t lowering overhead costs be an obviously positive outcome?
Ah, but thereâ€™s the rub: All this overspending creates a lot of employment â€” and moving toward a more efficient and equitable health care system will inevitably mean getting rid of many administrative jobs.
One study suggests that about 1.8 million jobs would be rendered unnecessary if America adopted a public health care financing system.
So what if some of these jobs involve debt collection, claims denial, aggressive legal action or are otherwise punitive, cruel or simply morally indefensible in a society that can clearly afford to provide high-quality health care to everyone?
Jobs are jobs, folks, as Joe Biden might say.
Indeed, thatâ€™s exactly what Bidenâ€™s presidential campaign is saying about the Medicare for all plans that Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are proposing: They â€œwill not only cost 160 million Americans their private health coverage and force tax increases on the middle class, but it would also kill almost two million jobs,â€ a Biden campaign official warned recently.
Note the word â€œkillâ€ in the statement.
That word might better describe not what could happen to jobs under Medicare for all but what the health care industry is doing to many Americans today.
Last week, the medical journal JAMA published a comprehensive study examining the cause of a remarkably grim statistic about our national well-being.
From 1959 to 2010, life expectancy in the United States and in other wealthy countries around the world climbed.
Then, in 2014, American life expectancy began to fall, while it continued to rise elsewhere.
What caused the American decline?
Researchers identified a number of potential factors, including tobacco use, obesity and psychological stress, but two of the leading causes can be pinned directly on the peculiarities and dysfunctions of American health care.
The first is the opioid epidemic, whose rise can be traced to the release, in 1996, of the prescription pain drug OxyContin.
In the public narrative, much of the blame for the epidemic has been cast on the Sackler family, whose firm, Purdue Pharma, created OxyContin and pushed for its widespread use.
But research has shown that the Sacklers exploited aberrant incentives in American health care.
Purdue courted doctors, patient groups and insurers to convince the medical establishment that OxyContin was a novel type of opioid that was less addictive and less prone to abuse.
The company had little scientific evidence to make that claim, but much of the health care industry bought into it, and OxyContin prescriptions soared.
The rush to prescribe opioids was fueled by business incentives created by the health care industry â€” for Purdue, for many doctors and for insurance companies, treating widespread conditions like back pain with pills rather than physical therapy was simply better for the bottom line.
Opioid addiction isnâ€™t the only factor contributing to rising American mortality rates.
The problem is more pervasive, having to do with an overall lack of quality health care.
The JAMA report points out that death rates have climbed most for middle-age adults, who â€” unlike retirees and many children â€” are not usually covered by government-run health care services and thus have less access to affordable health care.
The researchers write that â€œcountries with higher life expectancy outperform the United States in providing universal access to health careâ€ and in â€œremoving costs as a barrier to care.â€ In America, by contrast, cost is a key barrier.
A study published last year in The American Journal of Medicine found that of the nearly 10 million Americans given diagnoses of cancer between 2000 and 2012, 42 percent were forced to drain all of their assets in order to pay for care.
The politics of Medicare for all are perilous.
Understandably so: If youâ€™re one of the millions of Americans who loves your doctor and your insurance company, or who works in the health care field, I can see why you would be fearful of wholesale change.
But itâ€™s wise to remember that itâ€™s not just your own health and happiness that counts.
The health care industry is failing much of the country.
Many of your fellow citizens are literally dying early because of its failures.
â€œI got mine!â€ is not a good enough argument to maintain the dismal status quo.
The Apps on My Phone Are Stalking Me By Farhad Manjoo Jan. 22, 2020  There is much about the future that keeps me up at night â€” A.I.
weaponry, undetectable viral deepfakes, indefatigable and infinitely wise robotic op-ed columnists â€” but in the last few years, one technological threat has blipped my fear radar much faster than others.
That fear?
Ubiquitous surveillance.
I am no longer sure that human civilization can undo or evade living under constant, extravagantly detailed physical and even psychic surveillance; as a species, we are not doing nearly enough to avoid always being watched or otherwise digitally recorded.
Your location, your purchases, video and audio from within your home and office, your online searches and every digital wandering, biometric tracking of your face and other body parts, your heart rate and other vital signs, your every communication, recording, and perhaps your deepest thoughts or idlest dreams â€” in the future, if not already, much of this data and more will be collected and analyzed by some combination of governments and corporations, among them a handful of megacompanies whose powers nearly match those of governments.
Why am I so pessimistic?
Over the last year, as part of Times Opinionâ€™s Privacy Project, Iâ€™ve participated in experiments in which my devices were closely monitored in order to determine the kind of data that was being collected about me.
The experiments have given me new insight into the psychology underpinning surveillance; Iâ€™ve realized how blind we are to the kinds of insights tech companies are gaining about us through our gadgets.
Our blindness not only keeps us glued to privacy-invading tech â€” it also means that weâ€™ve failed to create a political culture that is in any way up to the task of limiting surveillance.
Thatâ€™s why, across the species, whether under American or European democracy or Chinese authoritarianism, few of our cultural or political institutions are even much trying to tamp down the surveillance state.
In China, the government is building a frightening surveillance dragnet in broad daylight, stitching together facial recognition, fingerprint and other databases into an all-seeing eye aiming to closely watch more than a billion citizens.
Yet the United States and other supposedly liberty-loving Western democracies have not ruled out such a future.
Just consider the odd politics surrounding privacy invasion.
Donald Trump and his supporters repeatedly argue that the F.B.I.
is corrupt and untrustworthy.
Yet, like Barack Obama before him, Trump and the Justice Department are pushing Apple to create a backdoor into the data on encrypted iPhones â€” they want the untrustworthy F.B.I.
and any local cop to be able to see everything inside anyoneâ€™s phone.
Apple, mercifully, is resisting, just as it did the request of Barack Obamaâ€™s Justice Department to create a loophole in iPhone security â€” but the fact that both Obama and Trump agreed on the need for breaking iPhone encryption suggests how thoroughly political leaders across a wide spectrum have neglected privacy as a fundamental value worthy of protection.
Indeed, because of a dearth of laws protecting our privacy â€” and almost no high-profile political discussion about the stakes at hand â€” Americans are sleepwalking into a future nearly as frightening as the one the Chinese are constructing.
I choose the word â€œsleepwalkingâ€ deliberately, because when it comes to digital privacy, a lot of us prefer the comfortable bliss of ignorance.
As a result, much of the surveillance engine operates underground â€” just beyond where many of us dare to look.
In recent months my colleagues at The Times and other media outlets have published a series of shattering investigations into modern digital surveillance.
Among other revelations: Advertising companies and data brokers are keeping insanely close tabs on smartphonesâ€™ location data, tracking users so precisely that their databases could arguably compromise national security or political liberty.
There are few meaningful checks on scanning for people using facial recognition, genetic profiles or other biometric data.
Tracking technologies have become cheap and widely available â€” for less than $100, my colleagues were able to identify people walking by surveillance cameras in Bryant Park in Manhattan.
This past weekend, The Timesâ€™s Kashmir Hill reported on a company called Clearview AI that has created a tool that â€œcould end your ability to walk down the street anonymously.â€ By scraping pictures from Facebook, YouTube and other websites to create a huge database of faces, the company lets cops identify people just by snapping a photo.
Itâ€™s Shazam for faces, not very different from the kind of facial recognition tools we worry the authorities may be using in China â€” and even though hundreds of police departments may have access to it, almost no one outside the company understands how it works.
The Clearview AI story suggests another reason to worry that our march into surveillance has become inexorable: Each new privacy-invading technology builds on a previous one, allowing for scary outcomes from new integrations and collections of data that few users might have anticipated.
I was recently confronted by this sort of cascade with my own smartphone tracking data.
Late last year, with the help of Stuart Thompson, an Opinion editor, I set up my phone to monitor how certain apps were tracking me.
I focused on apps that required me to grant them access to my physical location â€” among them apps to find cheap gas, coupons and nearby retail discounts, and to otherwise help me navigate and find deals as I wandered about the world.
The upshot: As the location-tracking apps followed me, I was able to capture the pings they sent to online servers â€” essentially recording their spying.
I sent the data to Stuart and his team, who interpreted and mapped the pings the apps had collected about me.
Their picture shocked me; the apps had followed me far more closely, capturing much more data and far more often, than I had imagined when Iâ€™d said yes to their tracking.
Look at this map, which follows the pings collected by the apps on one Sunday afternoon last year:  On the map, you can see the apps are essentially stalking me.
They see me drive out one morning to the gas station, then to the produce store, then to Safeway; later on I passed by a music school, stopped at a restaurant, then Whole Foods.
But location was only one part of the data the companies had about me; because geographic data is often combined with other personal information â€” including a mobile advertising ID that can help merge what you see and do online with where you go in the real world â€” the story these companies can tell about me is actually far more detailed than I can tell about myself.
Like a lot of people, Iâ€™ve long justified my apathy about privacy through innocence: Iâ€™m a stand-up guy â€” what do I have to hide?
But looking at the Godâ€™s-eye-view that a few coupon apps can glean about me, I can no longer pretend Iâ€™ve got nothing to worry about.
Sure, Iâ€™m not a criminal â€” but do I want anyone to learn everything about me?
And more to the point: Is it wise for us to let any entity learn everything about everyone?
Because those are the stakes.
The remaining uncertainty about the surveillance state is not whether we will submit to it â€” only how readily and completely, and how thoroughly it will warp our society.
Will we allow the government and corporations unrestricted access to every bit of data we ever generate, or will we decide that some kinds of collections, like the encrypted data on your phone, should be forever off limits, even when a judge has issued a warrant for it?
In the future, will there be room for any true secret â€” will society allow any unrecorded thought or communication to evade detection and commercial analysis?
And, if there can be no more secrets, how will we account for what we lose?
How completely will living under surveillance numb creativity and silence radical thought?
Can human agency survive the possibility that some companies will know more about all of us than any of us can ever know about ourselves?
Iâ€™m worried weâ€™ll soon be forced to find out.
The Bernie Sanders Fallacy By David Brooks Jan. 16, 2020  This is a golden age for â€œTheyism.â€ This is the belief that there is some malevolent, elite â€œtheyâ€ out there and â€œtheyâ€ are destroying life for the rest of us.
There is Donald Trumpâ€™s culture-war Theyism: The coastal cultural elites hate genuine Americans, undermining our values and opening our borders.
And there is Bernie Sandersâ€™s class-war Theyism: The billionaires have rigged the economy to benefit themselves and impoverish everyone else.
Each of these stories takes a genuine tension in society and blows it up into an all-explaining cartoon in which one part of America is trying to destroy the other part.
The G.O.P.
has been swallowed by Trumpâ€™s culture war, and many Democrats seem to be rushing to join Sandersâ€™s class war.
These Democrats are doing this even though itâ€™s political suicide.
Class-war progressivism always loses to culture-war conservatism because swing voters in the Midwest care more about their values â€” guns, patriotism, ending abortion, masculinity, whatever â€” than they do about proletarian class consciousness.
Democrats are doing this even though the Sanders class-war story is wrong.
Sanders starts with a truth: Workers need more bargaining power as they negotiate wages with their employers.
But then he blows this up into an all-explaining ideology: Capitalism is a system of exploitation in which capitalist power completely dominates worker power.
This ideology crashes against the facts.
In the first place, over the past few years wages for workers toward the bottom of the income stream have been rising faster than wages for those toward the top.
If the bosses have the workers by the throat, how can this be happening?
Second, wages are still generally determined by skills and productivity.
For example, Edward Lazear of Stanford University finds that between 1989 and 2017, productivity in mostly high-skill industries rose by roughly 34 percent and wages in those industries rose by 26 percent.
Productivity in industries with mostly less-skilled workers rose by 20 percent while wages grew by 24 percent.
As Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute puts it, capitalism is doing what itâ€™s supposed to do.
Itâ€™s rewarding productivity with pay, and some people and companies are more productive.
If you improve worker bargaining power, that may help a bit, but over the long run people canâ€™t earn what they donâ€™t produce.
Third, and most important, most of the increase in earnings inequality has happened between companies, not within them.
As John Van Reenen of M.I.T.
has found, all over the world superstar businesses are racing ahead of their competitors.
As those companies grow more productive, they earn more profit per employee and pay their workers more.
Companies that canâ€™t match that productivity donâ€™t, and their workers lag behind.
A recent Brookings Institution/Chumir Foundation report also notes that there is a growing productivity gap between superstar companies and everybody else.
Whether it is in tech, retail, manufacturing, utilities or services, productivity growth at the leading companies in each industry has remained very strong.
Those productive businesses are capturing larger and larger market shares.
But productivity is not growing fast among the lagging companies.
Workers in those businesses suffer.
Todayâ€™s successful bosses are doing what they should be doing: increasing productivity, growing their businesses and offering great service.
A side effect of their efficiency is they spend a smaller share of their revenue on labor even while raising their workersâ€™ wages.
In a global information-age economy, the rewards for being best are huge.
Thus, the core problem is not capitalists exploiting their workers; itâ€™s the rise of productivity inequality.
Itâ€™s the companies and individuals who donâ€™t have the skills to take advantage of new technologies.
The real solution, therefore, is not class war to hammer successful businesses.
Itâ€™s to boost and expand productivity for everybody else.
Thatâ€™s done the old-fashioned way â€” by having better schools and better vocational training, by having more open competitive markets, by creating incentives to expand investment, by making sure superstar businesses donâ€™t use lobbyists to lock in their advantages.
I understand if you want to stick to an us-versus-them political ideology.
Itâ€™s emotionally satisfying to base your political ideology on blaming people you dislike.
In fact, I strongly recommend Michael Lindâ€™s new book, â€œThe New Class War,â€ which is the best version of us/them.
Lind makes a lot of vague generalizations about the â€œmanagerial elite,â€ which he blames for our problems.
But at least heâ€™s interesting and provocative.
At least he understands that a politically plausible â€œTheyismâ€ is economically left and socially right â€” combining the culture war and class war into a tidy narrative.
But if you want to deal with our real problems, stop the us/them warfare and start dealing with productivity inequality.
Successful executives are doing whatâ€™s best for their companies, gathering as much talent as they can.
This isnâ€™t evil.
Itâ€™s not exploitation.
The job of public policy is to make it easier for everybody to do what successful people are doing.
Productivity is the key to national prosperity.
Every time we increase productivity for one person, we all thrive a little more, together.
The Flawed Humanity of Silicon Valley By Charlie Warzel Jan. 28, 2020  Every week brings a fresh hell in the tech world.
As news of the latest scandals pile up over weeks, months and eventually years, narratives switch.
Friendly tech companies become â€œBig Tech.â€ The narrative is flattened.
The tech giants become monolithic and their employees become caricatures â€” often of villains.
The truth is always messier, more interesting and more human.
It is a central tension animating Anna Wienerâ€™s excellent memoir, â€œUncanny Valley.â€ The book traces Ms. Wienerâ€™s navigating the tech world as a start-up employee in the mid 2010s â€” what might be thought of as the last years before Silicon Valleyâ€™s fall from darling status.
Ms. Wiener said she was drawn into the tech world by its propulsive qualities.
Graduating into a recession and spending her early 20s in publishing, tech offered opportunities: jobs, the seductive feeling of creating something and, of course, the money was good.
But what makes â€œUncanny Valleyâ€ so valuable is the way it humanizes the tech industry without letting it off the hook.
The book allows us to see the way that flawed technology is made and marketed: not by villains, but by blind spots, uncritical thinking and armies of ambivalent people coming into work each day trying their best â€” all while, sometimes unwittingly, laying the foundation of the surveillance economy.
From a privacy standpoint, â€œUncanny Valleyâ€ is helpful in understanding what itâ€™s like being on the other end of the torrent of information that streams from our devices each minute.
Early on, Ms. Wiener recounts working for a successful data analytics company and the gold rush toward big data, noting that â€œnot everyone knew what they needed from big data, but everyone knew that they needed it.â€  When confronted with the mass of information her company collected, Ms. Wiener describes feeling uncomfortable with the â€œGod Modeâ€ view that granted employees full access to user data.
â€œThis was a privileged vantage point from which to observe the tech industry, and we tried not to talk about it,â€ she writes.
This, she notes, becomes a pattern.
When Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the National Security Agencyâ€™s Prism program in 2013, employees at her own data company never discussed the news.
What she describes is a familiar dissociation for anyone who spends time interrogating tech companies on their privacy policies.
Her company simply didnâ€™t consider itself part of the surveillance economy:  â€œWe werenâ€™t thinking about our role in facilitating and normalizing the creation of unregulated, privately held databases on human behavior.
We were just allowing product managers to run better A/B tests.
We were just helping developers make better apps.
It was all so simple: people loved our product and leveraged it to improve their own products, so that people would love them, too.
There was nothing nefarious about it.
Besides, if we didnâ€™t do it, someone else would.
We were far from the only third-party analytics tool on the market.
The sole moral quandary in our space that we acknowledged outright was the question of whether or not to sell data to advertisers.
This was something we did not do, and we were righteous about it.
We were just a neutral platform, a conduit.
If anyone raised concerns about the information our users were collecting, or the potential for abuse of our product, the solutions manager would try to bring us back to earth by reminding us that we werenâ€™t data brokers.
We did not build cross-platform profiles.
We didnâ€™t involve third parties.
Users might not know they were being tracked, but that was between them and our customer companies.â€  They were, in other words, just doing their jobs.
Ms. Wiener frequently returns to this reticence to question the product, the end goals of the technology and the Silicon Valley ethos as a whole.
At her next job working on the terms of service team for a large open source code platform, she reveals how the evolution of the internet pushed her and her co-workers into becoming â€œreluctant content moderators.â€ Soon it became her teamâ€™s job to fashion a balance between preserving free speech on her platform and protecting it from trolls and neo-Nazis:  â€œWe wanted to tread lightly: core participants in the open-source software community were sensitive to corporate oversight, and we didnâ€™t want to undercut anyoneâ€™s techno-utopianism by becoming an overreaching arm of the company-state.
We wanted to be on the side of human rights, free speech and free expression, creativity and equality.
At the same time, it was an international platform, and who among us could have articulated a coherent stance on international human rights?â€  As a journalist who has covered content moderation issues for the better part of a decade, the perspective is somewhat clarifying.
Decisions that feel ad hoc or made by one or two people in the belly of a large company often are.
What looks from the outside like a conspiracy or nefarious techno-authoritarianism is often just confusion caused by poor management, poor communication and dizzying growth.
â€œMost of the company did not seem aware of how common it was for our tools to be abused,â€ Ms. Wiener writes of her group of de facto moderators.
â€œThey did not even seem to know that our team existed.
It wasnâ€™t their fault â€” we were easy to miss.
There were four of us for the platformâ€™s nine million users.â€  In this instance, â€œUncanny Valleyâ€ shows how the internet can thrust ordinary people into extraordinary positions of power â€” usually without qualifications or a how-to guide.
This is not to say that the book excuses any of the industryâ€™s reckless behavior.
Like a good travel writer, Ms. Wiener positions herself as an insider-outsider, â€œparticipating in something bigger than myself and still feeling apart from it.â€ And she is sufficiently critical of her and her peersâ€™ participation in the industry.
She writes that she would â€œwonder whether the N.S.A.
whistle-blower had been the first moral test for my generation of entrepreneurs and tech workers, and we had blown it,â€ she writes at one point near the end of the memoir.
Ms. Wienerâ€™s memoir comes at a point where the backlash against Silicon Valley is strong enough to have earned its own name.
Narratives have hardened and aggrieved tech employees are adopting a â€œbunker mentality.â€ As Ranjan Roy of the newsletter Margins wrote recently of Facebook, â€œthe rank and file are seeing that they are the villains, and will increasingly become so.â€ As so much of the reporting shows, the increased scrutiny and criticism of the techlash is important and almost all is warranted.
Big Tech has amassed wild, unregulated power that has grown unchecked.
Still, itâ€™s easy to get conspiratorial and to fall comfortably into black and white notions of good versus evil.
â€œUncanny Valleyâ€ is a reminder that the reality is far more muddled but no less damning.
Our dystopia isnâ€™t just the product of mustache-twirling billionaires drunk with power and fueled by greed â€” though it is that, too, sometimes.
Itâ€™s also the result of uncritical thinking, blind spots caused by an overwhelmingly white male work force and a pathological reluctance to ask the bigger question: Where is this all going?
What am I building?
What Iâ€™m Reading: Facebook will now show you exactly how it stalks you â€” even when youâ€™re not using Facebook.
Ring doorbell app packed with third-party trackers.
Leaked documents expose the secretive market for your web browsing data.
40 groups have called for a U.S. moratorium on facial recognition technology The Future of American Politics By David Brooks Jan. 30, 2020  Men and women are primarily motivated by self-interest.
No other partial truth has done as much damage as this one.
If you base your political and social systems on the idea that the autonomous self-interested individual is the basic unit of society, then you will wind up with an individualistic culture that widens the maneuvering room between people but shreds the relationships and community between people.
You will wind up with a capitalism in which superstar performers get concentrated in superstar cities and everybody else gets left behind.
In a system based purely on competitive individual self-interest, those who are advantaged get to race out further ahead year by year.
The sense of common community and equal dignity is annihilated.
This is the flaw of unrestrained liberalism, what the radicals call â€œneoliberalismâ€ or â€œlate capitalism.â€ And they are not entirely wrong.
Populists on the right and the left look at this current reality and they come to a swift conclusion: The game is rigged!
Liberalism is a con!
Then they come to a different conclusion.
The essential logic of society is not actually individuals seeking their self-interest.
Itâ€™s groups struggling for power.
Society is an arena where certain groups crush other groups.
On the Trumpian right itâ€™s the coastal cultural elite trying to crush and delegitimize the white Christian patriots of the heartland.
On the cultural left itâ€™s the whole Michel Foucault legacy.
Language is a tool the oppressor class uses to permanently marginalize the oppressed.
On the economic left itâ€™s the Bernie Sanders class war.
The greedy capitalist class rigs the system and immiserates the working class.
The populist narratives differ but all have the same underlying structure.
Weâ€™re locked in a life-or-death struggle of oppressor vs. oppressed groups.
Itâ€™s Us versus Them â€” the good people here and the bad people there.
The problems in society didnâ€™t just happen; they were consciously engineered by The Evil Other, who must be broken.
Our very existence is at stake!
If the anthropology of unrestrained liberalism is the autonomous individual making his own way, the anthropology of populism is warrior ants in a ruthless tribal war.
These are very different views of human nature, but they have something in common: Both narratives make us miserable!
In one, life is isolation, inequality and the feeling of being invisible.
In the other, itâ€™s malice, fear and constant war.
And thatâ€™s because both of these political tendencies are wrong about human nature.
They create societies that pulverize who we are and are made to be.
Human beings didnâ€™t evolve into the worldâ€™s dominant species because we are more autonomous.
We didnâ€™t do it because weâ€™re more vicious in tooth and claw.
We thrived as a species because we are better at cooperation.
We evolved complex social networks in our brains to make us better at bonding, teaching and collaborating.
We donâ€™t cooperate only to get things we want individually.
Often, we collaborate to build shared environments we can enjoy together.
Often, we pick a challenge just so we can have the joy of collaborating.
Relationships are ends to themselves.
Thus, the best future for American politics is not based on individual competition or group war.
Itâ€™s based on this narrative: We are an incredibly diverse society that got good at collaboration because we had to.
The best future politics puts collaborative pluralism, weaving, at the center.
That means, first, electing leaders who are masters at cooperation.
No offense, but if youâ€™re supporting Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders this year, collaboration skills are not high on your list of priorities.
Second, it means infusing cooperative weaver values into all of our organizations.
Thereâ€™s a fantastic community organization in Baltimore called Thread that has a few core competencies that shape its culture.
Weâ€™d be in much better shape if every organization in America lived out these values:  Show all the way up.
Be fully present, honest and vulnerable in all interactions.
Recognize your own value.
Push through discomfort to connect deeply with others.
Learn from all voices.
Most of our challenges are complex.
It takes every perspective to see an issue whole.
Assume people have the best of intentions, and actively focus on the value they bring.
Be intentional about being with those different from you.
Treat relationships as wealth.
Human bonds are the chief resource of your organization.
Recognize the inherent value of each person and meet each person where she or he is.
Fail forward.
Life is iterative.
Your vision is not always the answer, but rather a step in a creative learning process.
Set up feedback mechanisms that support change and personal growth.
Dogma wonâ€™t get you to the solution.
Openness and adjustment will.
The third task of weaver politics is reforming institutions so they encourage collaboration.
Some of our institutions, like Congress, have been completely subsumed by tribal warfare.
Other institutions, as Yuval Levin writes in his book â€œA Time to Build,â€ are no longer formative places where we learn and serve; they have become platforms individuals use to broadcast their supreme selves.
Still other institutions have become dehumanized.
Our schools, hospitals, prisons and welfare systems donâ€™t embed people in thick relationships.
They treat them as units to be processed and shoved out the door.
Still other institutions cease to exist.
Why do we still not have a national service program?
America has an enormous task of institutional reform ahead of it, just as it did in the Progressive era.
The fourth and final task of this kind of politics is transformative policies that directly address our most serious divides.
For example, reparations are a way to acknowledge the wrongs inflicted on African-Americans and to begin to heal that breach.
Congressman Ro Khanna has a proposal that would show rural America that everyone has a place in the new economy.
He would fund research and technology hubs throughout the country â€” a land grant college system for the 21st century.
The politics of weaving grows out of the acknowledgment that there is no dominant majority in America.
There is no moderate center.
Your group will never pulverize and eliminate your opposing group.
Thereâ€™s no choice but to set up better collaborative systems across difference.
This is not a problem, itâ€™s an adventure.
Yes, human beings are partly selfish and self-interested.
But we are also supremely social and collaborative.
This is the part we have to work on now.
The Meaning and Melodrama of an Italian-American Christmas By Frank Bruni Dec. 24, 2019  Grandma Bruni lived in a working-class neighborhood in a two-family home that Iâ€™d struggle to describe â€” it was that ordinary, that humble.
But it was known for blocks in every direction, at least around this time of year, and not because she went wild with multicolored lights or put one of those sleigh-plus-Santa monstrosities on the roof, the way some Christmas exhibitionists did.
No, it was famous because it was where Jesus was born.
And born.
And born.
Year after year, decade upon decade, in a ritual as reliable as the sunrise and equally comforting.
Presidents came and presidents went.
The economy roared; the economy whimpered.
Friends moved away, favorite television shows went dark.
But I could count on baby Jesus in all his plaster-of-Paris glory.
Grandma, you see, had this beloved crÃ¨che, but it wasnâ€™t the kind of miniature tableau that enabled the entire sprawling cast of the Nativity to fit on an end table or a bureau.
Hers took up a significant patch of her front lawn in White Plains, N.Y., and its centerpiece was a big wood shack, the pieces of which were hauled every year from a backyard shed and hammered together so that Mary and Joseph would have somewhere dry to hang out from the end of November until the Big Day.
They and their entourage were more than half life-size.
It was as if Grandma had invited a large party of anachronistically dressed dwarfs to camp out in her yard for the holiday season.
But for most of December, something was missing: baby Jesus, who was perhaps three-quarters life-size.
He would stay missing â€” metaphorically in utero, though technically in a bottom drawer of Grandmaâ€™s bedroom dresser â€” until the midnight moment when Christmas Eve became Christmas Day.
Grandma held to this schedule as if historical accuracy depended on it and White Plains occupied the same time zone as Bethlehem of millenniums ago.
At 11:58 p.m. on Dec. 24, sheâ€™d dim the lights.
Sheâ€™d put on a record of â€œSilent Night.â€ And sheâ€™d fetch baby Jesus from that drawer, where he lay swaddled in her finest white linens.
Gently cradling him in her arms, sheâ€™d walk slowly through the living room, out the front door and over to the shack.
Then sheâ€™d place him in a manger between Mary and Joseph.
And sheâ€™d cry, because the moment was an emotional one and, sheâ€™d somberly inform us, this Christmas just might be her last.
Her talent for pasta was surpassed only by her gift for melodrama.
Religion played a smaller part in her midwifery than youâ€™d think.
Grandma was nominally and notionally Roman Catholic and saw the church as the proper, even necessary, setting in which to mark the milestones of a life: birth, marriage, death.
But that was as much about continuity â€” about a predictable rhythm, with reliable ornaments â€” as it was about creed.
Jesus was a character in a commonly adopted narrative, a lyric in a widely sung song.
He was a totem.
Above all he was a tradition, and the Nativity scene in front of her house went hand in hand with a Christmas Eve menu of seven fishes, in accordance with Italian-American convention, and with the rule that gift opening started with the youngest of the clan and proceeded upward in accordance with age.
Doing things â€œthe right wayâ€ grounded her.
It was her center of gravity.
She died some three decades ago, and Iâ€™ve no idea what happened to that crÃ¨che.
But I know what happened to the family who found it both bonkers and beautiful, extravagant and essential.
In the manner of modern America, we scattered â€” pulled in this direction by work, in that direction by adventure, our commitments metastasizing, our free time shriveling.
We do better than most at forging moments together, but theyâ€™re less and less predictable.
Where I could once tell you without hesitation how Iâ€™d spent the previous two, three or four Christmas Eves â€” with Grandma and baby Jesus â€” I now have to strain to remember.
Last year, in a peculiar mood, I went alone to Las Vegas.
The year before that?
Iâ€™m honestly not sure.
That saddens me in ways that it would regardless of whatâ€™s happening in this seething country and this fractious world, but current events intensify my appreciation for customs now lost, for touchstones that have crumbled.
Weâ€™re at one of those junctures where so little can be taken for granted, so much is up for grabs.
The worthiest of values come under fire.
The sturdiest of institutions buckle.
Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not alone in finding that holidays matter more, as do the familiar scripts and cherished props with which theyâ€™re celebrated.
Theyâ€™re assertions of normalcy amid change and loss.
The solace is in the details.
Grandma understood this.
She had a wisdom as ancient as the birth of baby Jesus.
The Meaninglessness of the .Org Domain By Sam Wineburg and Nadav Ziv Dec. 5, 2019  Are todayâ€™s high school students, the ones we call â€œdigital natives,â€ able to separate fact from fiction?
Not according to a survey we released last month in which 3,446 high school students across the country evaluated the trustworthiness of different websites.
One such site was co2science.org, a climate-change skeptic group that claims to â€œdisseminate factual reports and sound commentary.â€ Students could go anywhere on the web to investigate the site.
A quick search uncovers the groupâ€™s past ties to the fossil fuel industry.
But 96 percent of students never uncovered this industry connection.
Too often studentsâ€™ evaluations stalled at three letters: â€œThis page is a reliable source to obtain information from,â€ one wrote, â€œyou see in the URL that it ends in .org as opposed to .com.â€  The kids are wrong.
Dot-org symbolizes neither quality nor trustworthiness.
Itâ€™s a marketing tool that relies on a widespread but false association with credibility.
Kids arenâ€™t the only ones misinformed.
A 2012 international study found that nearly half of Americans, and larger percentages in France, Brazil and India, believed that an organization must meet â€œsome criteriaâ€ before it could register under .org.
The dot-org domain is controlled by the Public Interest Registry, which was sold last month to Ethos Capital, a private equity firm.
The three letters are marketed as â€œa powerful signal that your site serves a greater good â€” rather than just a bottom line.â€ Itâ€™s a claim that leads people to make errors about whom and what to trust.
Unlike dot-gov or dot-edu, which are closed to the general public, dot-org is an â€œopenâ€ domain.
Anyone can register a dot-org without passing a character test.
Even commercial sites can be dot-orgs.
Craigslist â€” among the worldâ€™s largest ad sites â€” is craigslist.org.
There are over 10 million dot-orgs, each of which pays roughly $10 per year to register.
All you have to do to get one is fill out an online form and provide payment.
Registration fees generated $92 million in revenue for the Public Interest Registry in 2018 alone.
In theory these revenues could grow much larger soon â€” in June, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the supervisory body that regulates the internetâ€™s domain name system, agreed to lift price caps on dot-orgs.
Still, Andy Shea, a spokesperson for the Public Interest Registry, says it plans to keep the pricing for dot-orgs low, with increases of no more than 10 percent on average a year.
In the Public Interest Registryâ€™s latest marketing blitz, they unveiled a logo painted in â€œdeep royal blue,â€ a shade they say evokes â€œfeelings of trust, security and reliability.â€ They tell new customers to expect an increase in â€œdonations, and trust for donorsâ€ when they become part of the â€œdomain of trust.â€  Noteworthy nonprofits, civic organizations and religious groups have embraced the domain â€” and so have a host of bad actors.
All reaped the benefits of dot-orgâ€™s association with credibility.
Educational institutions unwittingly shape misperceptions around dot-orgs.
Many colleges and universities, including Harvard and Northwestern, steer students in the wrong direction.
They equate dot-orgs with nonprofit groups and issue no warning of the dangers lurking beneath the domainâ€™s positive aura.
Dot-org is the favored designation of â€œastroturfâ€ sites, groups that masquerade as grass roots efforts but are backed by corporate and political interests.
One of these is the Employment Policies Institute, which claims to sponsor â€œnonpartisan research.â€ It was actually founded and run by the head of a public relations firm that represents the restaurant industry.
Another dot-org, Americans for Prosperity Foundation, says it addresses major social problems through â€œbroad-based grass roots outreach.â€ In reality, it was founded by the billionaire Koch brothers and many of its â€œgrass rootsâ€ activists are paid.
Thereâ€™s an even bigger risk to equating dot-org sites with do-gooders.
Dozens of neo-Nazi, anti-L.G.B.T., anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant groups bear the dot-org seal.
A random sample of a hundred organizations designated as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that 49 percent carry the dot-org domain.
â€œTypically the domain name system is not an appropriate tool to address website content questions and speech issues,â€ said Shea, the Public Interest Registry spokesperson.
â€œThat said, if a site on a .org domain engages in specific threats of violence, we would not hesitate to take action on it under our Anti-Abuse Policy.â€  A 2019 United Nations survey showed that citizens the world over have lost trust in the internet.
Restoring it will take herculean efforts.
The groups that control the internetâ€™s domain system could lead the way by being honest about what these initials do and donâ€™t represent.
The Public Interest Registry and Ethos Capital could channel some of the millions earned from the dot-org mirage to fund initiatives that educate the public on the domainâ€™s shortcomings.
They can start by adding a bright red asterisk to their royal blue logo: â€œDot-org implies nothing about an organizationâ€™s intent.
Buyer Beware.â€ The Next Decade Will Be Just as Bad By Farhad Manjoo Nov. 20, 2019  We will remember the 2010s as a grifterâ€™s paradise.
These were the years when our collective sense of objective reality totally fell apart and when politics, business, technology, culture and even ordinary life fell fully under the sway of a new breed of swindler, huckster, influencer, troll and hacker.
Scams and fakery were not just ascendant this decade â€” they were often the dominant story line.
It was a time of â€œlife comes at you fastâ€ and â€œmilkshake duck.â€ The primary feeling of the 2010s was one of punch-drunken disorientation, of always having the rug pulled out from under you.
And this was the big lesson of the 2010s: Almost nothing is as it seems.
Doubt everything.
Trust no one.
Not that this idea works very well: Doubting everything may be a workable plan for individual survival in a fracturing media universe dominated by algorithms and digital media of dubious authenticity, but pervasive doubt could just as well bring on civilizational ruin.
Getting through modern life seems to require adopting a corrosive view of society that makes a hash of our fundamental ideas about the value of cooperation and trust among our fellow humans.
Weâ€™re bringing on a death-spiral of distrust â€” and I fear that in the 2020s and beyond, grifters peddling alternative facts may come to suffocate us all.
The most obvious example of the hucksterâ€™s rise was, of course, Donald Trump.
When Trump announced his bid for the presidency in 2015, much of the political and media establishment, including many leading Republicans, thought the idea of a self-dealing, conspiracy theorizing reality TV star winning the White House was a pretty funny joke.
Few of them understood Trumpâ€™s effectiveness at hacking the news landscape to command our attention completely.
Few of them could have guessed that rather than the establishment foiling Trump, his slippery style and overwhelming blizzard of lies would so fully alter political and media culture that by the end of the decade, members of the G.O.P.
would be embracing and echoing his conspiracy theories as a way to forestall his removal from office.
While conspiracy thinking took full flower on the right, it began to bloom on the left, too.
Trumpâ€™s election was followed by the rise of anti-Trump online influencers who came to dominate news and activism.
These were the â€œresistance griftersâ€ â€” Michael Avenatti, the brothers Ed and Brian Krassenstein, the nearly self-parodic Louise Mensch â€” who peddled a self-serving brand of breathless anti-Trumpism heavily peppered with calls to buy their books and other merch.
A specter of foreign disinformation led to widespread suspicion, and it became a handy defense for grifters to dismiss opposition as bots or Russian shills.
The grift wasnâ€™t limited to politics.
The tech industry welcomed hucksters with open arms.
Look at WeWork, Uber and Theranos â€” once high-flying start-ups that promised to change the world in big ways and small, each unmasked for peddling false prospects, unreal tech or hiding systemic corruption and abuse.
Facebook and other social media services were not just a haven of state-sponsored disinformation; with dodgy, easily gamed stats, social media increasingly came to provide a false view of the world.
Facebook admitted a series of errors overstating advertising metrics.
YouTubeâ€™s stats were shown to be lousy with fake views, Twitterâ€™s were overwhelmed by fake followers and Amazon was full of fake luxury goods.
Scams pervaded new technologies and old ones.
The spectacular rise in the price of Bitcoin in 2017 was later found to be the product of market manipulation.
And, according to a report by the telecommunications firm First Orion, about 29 percent of all voice calls placed in 2018 were scam robocalls; one estimate puts the volume of spam calls at billions per month.
Why are we being overrun by scams?
Societyâ€™s signals for judging reputation and trustworthiness havenâ€™t caught up with the changing tech.
Even though we know better, we reflexively mistake Instagram for reality â€” online influence is seen as a proxy for real-world authenticity, and so we are constantly falling under the sway of people whoâ€™ve found ways to game the digital realm.
On your phone, the Fyre Festival looks irresistible.
We are also too easily blinded by wealth, or markers for wealth.
Anna Sorokin, the Russian immigrant convicted this year of conning New York society into thinking she was a German heiress named Anna Delvey, defrauded hotels and banks of hundreds of thousands of dollars by pretending to be rich.
Sheâ€™d hand out $100 bills to anyone and everyone.
â€œFor a stretch of time in New York, no small amount of the cash in circulation was coming from Anna Delvey,â€ Jessica Pressler wrote.
You could argue that my take on the end of truth is too gloomy.
Consider the clarifying power of #MeToo â€” how in the cases of Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein, Bill Cosby and other once-powerful men, we witnessed the power of facts and objective, clear eyed investigation to alter the brutal power structures that had long held victims in silence.
You might also argue that collectively, weâ€™re getting better at spotting hucksters and frauds.
The resistance grifters had a good run, but we found them out.
Less than a year from now, if not sooner, Trump, too, may hit the end of his run.
But Iâ€™m skeptical that these things signal some reason for optimism.
Our information system has slipped its moorings, and as a result, lying and scheming and fraud has simply become too effective a life strategy.
As I argued in March, when the celebrity college admissions scandal broke, weâ€™re seeing the â€œuberizationâ€ of corruption â€” bending the rules is becoming routine and pervasive, a push-button cheat code for modern life.
Itâ€™s not a big leap from â€œTrust no oneâ€ to â€œswindle everyone.â€ Happy new decade, I guess.
The Perverse Servility of Bill Barr By Frank Bruni Dec. 10, 2019  Donald Trump famously said that he could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and not â€œlose any voters.â€ I donâ€™t know about that.
But Iâ€™m confident that he wouldnâ€™t lose Bill Barr.
Execution privilege, Barr would probably call it.
Heâ€™d release a statement or hold a news conference to say that Trump had a spastic trigger finger or was triggered by Adam Schiff or was set up by those dastardly Ukrainians, who are never up to any good.
Such is the magnitude of Barrâ€™s servility, the doggedness of his deference.
Heâ€™s the presidentâ€™s moral launderer.
Trump does evil, and Barr washes him clean.
As attorney general, heâ€™s supposed to be the nationâ€™s lawyer.
But he has bought into the autocratic delusion that Trump equals America, that national interest and presidential prerogative are inextricably intertwined.
So heâ€™s Trumpâ€™s advocate, come hell or high crimes, as surely as Pat Cipollone or Rudy Giuliani is.
On Monday, showing fresh contempt for the people who work under him in the Justice Department, Barr renounced a determination by the departmentâ€™s inspector general that the F.B.I.â€™s investigation into the Trump campaignâ€™s ties to Russia was legitimate and that anti-Trump bias was not its animating force.
He did this instantly.
And then, on Tuesday, did it again, with even less subtlety and more sanctimony.
â€œIt was a travesty,â€ he said of the investigation, and he was speaking not just of the sloppiness and haste of some of the F.B.I.â€™s actions, with which the inspector general also took issue.
He was dismissing the whole effort as rotten.
It was an eerie echo of his efforts last spring, when he sought to neuter Robert Muellerâ€™s findings about the Trump campaignâ€™s openness to Russian help and the presidentâ€™s attempts to obstruct justice.
Give Barr points for consistency.
He has bought fully into the idea that the zeal of Trumpâ€™s detractors matters more than the presidentsâ€™ abuses of power.
But what of the Constitution?
What of common decency?
Barr isnâ€™t concerning himself with those.
To do so would call into question the honor of serving in this administration, the compliment of holding the job that Trump gave him.
And he wants that compliment.
That pedestal.
He prefers to see himself as a holy warrior than as an unholy dupe.
To appreciate his perspective, you must travel back two months, to the University of Notre Dame, where he delivered a speech that garnered some headlines but not nearly enough of them.
You should read it.
You should savor its grandiosity â€” it has references to the dawn of homo sapiens, the twilight of the Judeo-Christian order, Edmund Burke, James Madison â€” so that you can understand his current overreach, born of his certainty that he knows better than the rest of the body politic and is called to heal us.
You should note his remarksâ€™ obsession with morality and you should try not to laugh, the same way you stifle chuckles when youâ€™re reminded that Mike Pompeo is a putatively worshipful Christian and you try to square that with how he abetted the persecution of Marie Yovanovitch, leaves his State Department charges twisting in the wind and genuflects before a false prophet.
In Trump he trusts.
You should dwell on the part of Barrâ€™s jeremiad where he says that â€œmen are subject to powerful passions and appetites and, if unrestrained, are capable of ruthlessly riding roughshod over their neighbors and the community.â€ Ruthless?
Roughshod?
Thatâ€™s Trump in an alliterative nutshell, but Barr seemed to be perversely oblivious to that.
He was making a case for Trumpâ€™s presidency.
The wonder of this wretched moment has never been the existence and stench of a bad egg in the Oval Office.
Thatâ€™s hardly strange, given how ably shamelessness serves ambition.
The wonder is how many other bad eggs the current president has assembled or hatched.
The wonder is this fluffy, funky omelet of unscrupulousness.
All these supposedly godly men â€” Barr, Pompeo, Mike Pence, Ben Carson, Rick Perry and more â€” cluster around such a demonstrably godless one.
They rationalize that Trumpâ€™s indulgence of certain religious factions absolves him of his sins.
Barr is the principal agent of that absolution.
Heâ€™s also a paragon of hypocrisy, telling Pete Williams of NBC News that the F.B.I.
investigation of Trumpâ€™s campaign was an ominous abuse of government power for partisan aims.
That description better suits the conduct for which Trump is about to be impeached.
I donâ€™t know how Barr kept a straight face.
Actually, I do.
Since betrothing himself to Trump, he has had ample practice.
In the Notre Dame speech, without any palpable sense of irony, he urged a â€œmoral renaissanceâ€ and delivered this priceless line: â€œNo society can exist without some means for restraining individual rapacity.â€ I agree.
In our society, impeachment is one of those means.
The law is another.
And if Barr could dig out his conscience from under all those layers of ego, heâ€™d see that the rapacious individual in direst need of restraint is the one heâ€™s letting roam free.
The Politics of Exhaustion By David Brooks Dec. 12, 2019  There are two power blocs driving politics today.
First, thereâ€™s the proletariat.
These are the working-class voters who go to Trump rallies in the U.S. and powered Brexit and Boris Johnsonâ€™s campaign in the U.K.
They see their best world receding and they want a tough guy to bring it back.
Second, there is the precariat.
These are the young and educated voters caught in the gig economy, who see no career security ahead.
They want leaders like Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn who will promise enveloping policies â€” free college, free internet, free child care â€” to give them some sense of safety.
These two groups are different in some ways.
When the proletarians attack their enemies, they do so from a position of perceived social inferiority, so their attacks are resentful and brutal.
When the precariat attacks, it does so from a position of perceived moral superiority, so its attacks are filled with ridicule, mockery and scorn.
But the movements do have parallels.
Both are driven by a fear of the future, and of each other.
Both have a tendency to embrace catastrophic, apocalyptic visions of the ruin around us.
Dystopia has become the opiate of the activist class.
Haunted by economic insecurity, they will tolerate any sin in their leader â€” racism, anti-Semitism, dishonesty â€” so long as that person is willing to fight and be on their side.
They both support massive, unrealistic policy proposals, because they reject the idea that politics is simply the muddled way we settle differences with people we disagree with.
These two power blocs are driving the debate and setting the agenda.
But thereâ€™s another group of people, who have become the most interesting part of the electorate, both here and in Britain.
Itâ€™s the exhausted 75 percent, people who are defined not by any common ideology but by an affective state â€” they are simply worn out by the endless war between these two armies.
Exhaustion has become an independent force in modern politics.
Many people are voting for whatever candidate will exhaust them less.
Thursdayâ€™s British election was defined by the fact that most voters were simply ground down by Johnson and Corbyn.
The Economist called the election â€œBritainâ€™s nightmare before Christmas.â€  Writing in The Guardian, Rafael Behr observed, â€œWe live with the undertow of sadness and dread.
We are braced for that feeling, like seeing callous hands rummaging in a private drawer where a delicate, tangled identity is stored and pulling at the threads.
It feels like exile.â€  People in the exhausted camp are tired of having politics thrust in their face every hour.
As Ryan Streeter of the American Enterprise Institute has found, young people who are â€œlonely at least once in a whileâ€ are more than seven times more likely to be active in politics than those who are socially active.
Those who are exhausted have other things to do.
They want to restore politics to its rightful place, and find meaning, attachment, entertainment and morality in something else besides Twitter wars and election campaigns.
Years and years of exhaustion have also made these people weary, cynical and disgusted.
Exhaustion, as always, induces a sort of pessimism, a feeling that we are living in terrible times, a sort of weariness of the soul.
As Peter Stockland of the think tank Cardus put it, â€œThe combined effect of fear and exhaustionâ€ is â€œproducing a cynicism so deep and murky and toxic that it verges on the sin of bearing false witness against reality.â€  But the chief feature of the voters in the exhausted group is timidity.
They do not get energy from conflict, the way, say, Trump does.
Their instinct is to keep their heads down and just get through this craziness.
On campuses 10 percent of students are able to intimidate the other 90 percent, who donâ€™t want to say the wrong thing and get canceled.
In Congress, the Trumpians are able to intimidate the members who realize what a problem he is.
The people in the two big power blocs are not good at winning the war against each other, but they are really good at intimidating the moderates on their own side.
In this way, those in the exhausted camp perpetuate their own misery.
They complain about the terrible choices each election cycle, but never organize enough or become imaginative enough to offer something they themselves might want.
In Britain theyâ€™ve mostly taken money out of politics, but they still had an election even worse and more polarized than our own.
In the end, if Johnson, as expected, wins easily, it will be in part because exhausted voters will have swung to Trump/Johnson nationalist demagogy since the only alternative is a Corbyn/Sanders class war.
In the States, voters still have a chance to turn the emotional page, to elect a person who displays that you can be a progressive or you can be a conservative without turning politics into perpetual war.
Pete Buttigieg is rising and Joe Bidenâ€™s support is resilient precisely because they are not exhausting.
The interesting question is whether, in the heat of battle, the exhausted voters can get over their fatigue, cynicism and timidity and take their own side in a fight.
A Ridiculously Optimistic History of the Next Decade By David Brooks Jan. 2, 2020  Looking back at the 2020s from our vantage point in 2030, the first great event was the complete destruction of Donald Trumpâ€™s Republican Party.
As the former Republican consultant Mike Murphy had noticed, there were roughly 300 state and federal elections during the Trump years and Republicans did horribly in most of them.
The 2020 vote was a continuation of that trend.
Trumpâ€™s landslide defeat left him humiliated, and the Republicans lost their Senate majority.
Trump cried fraud and tried to whip up his followers, but they turned their backs.
He went from idol to scapegoat in an instant.
It seemed they could forgive him everything but losing.
Many temporarily retreated from political life, the way evangelical Christians did after the ignominy of the Scopes trial.
President Joe Biden faced an interesting dynamic in his party.
The political power was with moderates.
The intellectual power was with the left.
People of color, whose views were largely more moderate, became the crucial swing faction.
As president, Biden resisted the interest groups that wanted him to address health care first.
Instead, he did child and earned-income tax credits, infrastructure, expanded early childhood education, expanded prison reform, and so on â€” what some writers called â€œreparations by any other name.â€ He gave regulatory czar Elizabeth Warren a special portfolio to take on Big Tech.
The major events of the decade were cultural, not political.
The Trump era had witnessed a crisis of connection at the bottom of society and a crisis of authority at the top.
Social repair was the top order of the day once a new president took office.
The first whiff of the cultural restoration was the â€œAccountability Clubsâ€ that spread across the nationâ€™s campuses.
College students realized that America stinks at accountability.
Either there is no accountability (Wall Street after the financial crisis) or people have their lives destroyed for a â€œproblematicâ€ tweet.
The Accountability Clubs bore the motto â€œTruth and Mercy.â€ Students wanted to restore a culture in which facts mattered.
They were also searching for a way to judge others in a graduated and humane manner, allowing for repentance, forgiveness and restoration.
Marshall McLuhan once remarked that â€œmoral indignation is a technique used to endow an idiot with dignity.â€ Suddenly indignation, the keystone emotion of the Trump years, was lame.
Empathy made a comeback.
The second cultural trend of the decade was the rise of the urban church.
Suburban megachurch attendance fell, because the pastors had disgraced themselves under Trump.
But suddenly there was a surge in church plants in places like Brooklyn, Washington, D.C., Chicago and San Francisco, as highly educated people found homes for their spiritual longings.
The churches were liturgically highly charismatic (Bethel music) and highly universalistic and intellectual (Richard Rohr).
Their politics were an odd mix â€” pro-L.G.B.T.Q., pro-life, active on climate change, pro-animal rights (one of the signature moral causes of the decade).
The religious left gained on the religious right.
At the same time, the racial justice conversation went intimate.
America is involved in a multigenerational process of truth and reconciliation.
In the teens, the truth-telling had generally revolved around historic events â€” slavery, lynching, redlining.
In the 2020s, a series of writers, artists and directors gave us vivid descriptions of the subtleties of contemporary black life.
The profusion of video streaming networks allowed a new generation of artists to take audiences inside the psychological lives of people of color.
These artists realized that structural change would happen when people learned to see one another whole.
The most important cultural change came to be known as the Civic Renaissance.
During the first two decades of the century, hundreds of thousands of new civic organizations came into being â€” healing political divides, fighting homelessness, promoting social mobility and weaving communities.
But these organizations were small.
They did not grow into the big national chapter-based structures that had repaired Americaâ€™s social fabric a century earlier â€” the Y.M.C.A., the Rotary, the Boy Scouts.
By the 2020s, philanthropists and community builders realized the only way to change culture and weave the social fabric was by creating an A.F.L.-C.I.O.
of civil society, with big national voices and large, decentralized national organizations so that people across America had easy and practical pathways to get involved in community revival.
In the 2010s, it seemed like the liberal order was cracking up.
In the 2020s, that feeling vanished.
The decline of the Chinese economy delegitimized the authoritarian model.
It turns out you canâ€™t run a centrally controlled economy without a lot of waste, corruption and riot police.
Meanwhile, the American political system began to work better.
The G.O.P.
re-emerged under Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio as a better version of a working-class party â€” socially right, economically left.
Democrats remained dominant through the decade.
Their partyâ€™s biggest accomplishment was in foreign affairs â€” the repair of Americaâ€™s alliances and the restoration of global American leadership.
Americans were more collaborative in the 2020s.
And the New York Mets won the World Series every single year.
The Shaky Future of .org Domains By Josephine Wolff Jan. 27, 2020  Online commerce and for-profit activity have largely shaped the internet over the past 25 years, but a few important corners of the internet have remained staunchly nonprofit, retaining some of the internetâ€™s early charm and resistance to commercial interests.
One of those corners is the .org top-level domain, the go-to domain for nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations looking to establish an affordable and reputable online presence.
Domain names for websites, like nytimes.com or un.org or tufts.edu, are the key real estate of the internet.
Without a domain, it is next to impossible to have an online presence; there are now more than 350 million domain names registered worldwide.
Those domain names are sold to customers by registrars (like GoDaddy) which partner with registries (like Verisign, which manages the .com top-level domain or all the domain names ending in .com).
Domain names are big business â€” thereâ€™s a lot of money at stake when divvying them up among all the registrars and registries.
At the top of the domain name hierarchy sits the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a nonprofit that designates which registries control which top-level domains and helps resolve disputes around domain ownership.
ICANN has a unique governance structure: It is run by a board of directors that incorporates feedback from different advisory committees composed of government officials, industry representatives and civil society members.
It is a model that ICANN refers to as â€œmultistakeholderâ€ governance based on the premise â€œthat all users of the internet deserve a say in how it is run.â€  Since 2002, domains ending in .org have been purchased through an agency called the Public Interest Registry, which is owned by the Internet Society, a well-regarded nonprofit working to expand access to the internet across the world.
But, in November, the Internet Society announced it was planning to sell the Public Interest Registry â€” along with control of all the .org domains â€” for $1.1 billion to a recently formed private equity company called Ethos Capital with close ties to former leaders of the internet governance community.
The proposed sale has sparked outrage from many people at prominent internet nonprofits, including the Wikimedia Foundation and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and rightly so.
One worry is that Ethos, in an attempt to make the .org top-level domain as profitable as possible, will rapidly raise prices for its customers.
For years, a 2013 contract capped the cost of an .org domain at $8.25 with an allowed increase of no more than 10 percent a year â€” a restriction that kept .org domains affordable.
Today, a .org domain costs $9.93 a year.
But in June 2019, ICANN approved a new contract with the Public Interest Registry eliminating the price cap, even though thousands of people voiced opposition to that decision during a period of public comment.
Ethos has said it will continue to raise prices for .org domains by no more than 10 percent per year, but itâ€™s not clear how those promises will be enforced, or by whom, and the timing of the sale â€” following immediately on the elimination of the price cap â€” has contributed to some of the skepticism surrounding the deal.
Another fear is that Ethos will cave to pressure from foreign governments about which organizations should and should not be allowed to own .org domains.
Currently, .org is an open domain so anyone is allowed to register a .org domain, and there are more than 10 million of them registered worldwide.
But the Public Internet Registry has the authority to suspend domain names for illegal activity, and one of the concerns raised in a public letter opposing the sale is the potential for governments to target NGOs by accusing them of illegal activity and pressuring the Public Internet Registry to take down their domains.
Just last month, for instance, the Chinese government sanctioned five United States-headquartered NGOs for their involvement in the protests in Hong Kong; all five of those NGOs have .org domains.
There are other reasons to be worried about the sale.
The circumstances of the deal between Ethos and the Internet Society seem at odds with the multistakeholder model of cooperative, transparent governance that the internet community has worked so hard to develop.
Beyond just threatening the integrity of the .org top-level domain, the sale of the Public Interest Registry without any further community involvement or oversight from ICANN threatens the integrity of that governance model and the publicâ€™s trust that the organizations responsible for running the internet have their best interests at heart.
ICANN has the ability to block the deal, as well as to question the involved parties about how they would manage the .org domain and protect customers, but in a statement to The Financial Times, ICANN said it â€œdoes not have authority over the proposed acquisition,â€ a claim that is patently false.
ICANN itself, in a blog post last month, acknowledged that â€œPIR must obtain ICANNâ€™s prior approval before any transaction that would result in a change of control of the registry operatorâ€ and pledged to take â€œits responsibility in evaluating this proposed transaction very seriously.â€ But while ICANN says it has asked PIR for more information about the sale, it has told the public very little about those inquiries or the ensuing responses, and it has not solicited any public comments on the transaction.
ICANNâ€™s reasoning seems to be that since the sale does not threaten the security, reliability or stability of the .org domain, it is not its place to intervene.
But ICANN regularly makes decisions about domain ownership that are unrelated to issues of security and stability â€” just last year, for instance, it granted Amazon ownership of the .amazon top-level domain over the objections of several South American countries.
That decision resolved a seven-year-long dispute, dating to 2011 when ICANN decided to open up more top-level domains beyond the standard ones like .com, .org and .gov.
ICANN received nearly 2,000 applications in 2012 for new top-level domains like .google, .love, .microsoft and .wine, and for each application the applicant had to pay ICANN $185,000, in addition to ongoing fees for maintaining the domains.
This brought a massive influx of cash for ICANN that helped fund its subsequent international expansion and the process of severing its final ties with the United States government in 2016.
The point of severing those ties was to engender greater international trust in ICANN and, by extension, the system of global internet governance that it oversees.
But instead, ICANN seems at risk of being captured by commercial interests â€” a risk that first became apparent with the lucrative 2012 expansion of the top-level domains that benefited no one besides ICANN.
Odds are that seven years later youâ€™ve still never interacted with a website ending in one of those domains and, if you have, it was probably only a means of delivering spam or malware to your computer.
Today, ICANN is in a very delicate position because it derives its authority not from a contract with the United States but instead from its ability to balance the interests of all its various stakeholders from government officials to civil society groups and for-profit companies and maintaining credibility with the worldwide community.
Itâ€™s easy to see why it is not eager to jump into the fray and interfere with, or even question, the Ethos deal for fear of drawing criticism.
But the real risk to ICANN is in failing to protect the remaining corners of the internet preserved for public good and letting its for-profit stakeholders become the dominant voice in its decision-making processes.
Just as ICANNâ€™s former relationship with the United States government proved problematic for it in trying to sustain a credible role in global governance activities, so will a too-close relationship with the for-profit sector at the expense of individual internet users.
ICANN should publicly investigate this sale so that all of its stakeholders can see exactly which safeguards will be put in place to protect .org customers.
And if those safeguards are not sufficient or enforceable, if they meet with widespread disapproval and dissatisfaction from .org customers and registrars, then ICANN should make good on its promise to provide consensus-based multistakeholder governance and, if necessary, block the deal from going through.
ICANN cannot and should not be hiding from controversial domain disputes.
It is the only entity with authority over these decisions, and its willingness to exercise that power will ultimately be good not just for the internet and internet users but also for ICANN itself.
The Sidney Awards By David Brooks Dec. 19, 2019  Iâ€™ve been giving out the Sidney Awards (initially called the Hookies) for long-form essays since 2004, in honor of the late great philosopher Sidney Hook.
This year there were more phenomenal articles than ever before, many more than I can list.
The topics they tackled were also more downbeat than ever before.
Itâ€™s been that kind of year.
Several of the people who sent me their own lists of favorites suggested Candace Voglerâ€™s essay â€œA Spiritual Autobiography,â€ in Comment.
Itâ€™s unlike any essay youâ€™ve ever read.
Vogler suffered a childhood of unimaginable sexual abuse and neglect.
â€œI was afraid to be alone.
I was afraid of the other children in school.
I was afraid of the other children in the neighborhood.
I feared that an evil thing had attached itself to me, and could injure anyone who got close to me.â€  Her life took a series of improbable turns: Berkeley feminism, Quakerism, a range of gay friends in society high and low, family disruption, bar fights, an Afro-Brazilian spiritual practice called Umbanda.
From Jesus she learned that not all men are toxic.
She is now an esteemed philosopher at the University of Chicago.
You canâ€™t summarize this essay because itâ€™s so hard to encapsulate this lifeâ€™s twists and turns.
â€œI enjoy a kind of peace now that I could not have imagined before.
I am the luckiest person I know,â€ Vogler writes, reflecting on the arrival of many graces into her life.
Iâ€™ve co-taught with her a couple of times (sheâ€™s an amazing teacher) and had no idea of the back story that she carries around â€” a reminder that many people we meet carry back stories that are simply mind-boggling.
In â€œWhen the Culture War Comes for the Kids,â€ in The Atlantic, George Packer describes what happens when the ferociously competitive meritocratic culture of the New York educated class collides with the ferocious social justice warrioring of the New York educated class.
Packer traces his own familyâ€™s perilous adventure through a few Brooklyn schools and writes a piece that captures the zeitgeist of our age.
His sonâ€™s public school coerced parents into opting out of standardized tests and made the bathrooms gender neutral, leading female students to hold their bladder all day rather than go to the bathroom with boys.
It taught the oppression of every out-group but never the history of the American founding.
Itâ€™s not the schoolâ€™s decisions themselves that are so remarkable but the atmosphere of P.C.
religious zealotry that surrounds them, and the anguish of progressive parents who have to send their precious children into the maw of ideological re-education camps that in theory they agree with.
In â€œThe Unthinkable Has Happened,â€ in Vulture, Jayson Greene describes what happened when a brick fell from an eighth-floor windowsill and hit his daughter in the head.
Itâ€™s a fatherâ€™s wrenching and beautiful minute-by-minute account of the next few days.
At one point he and his wife are in the hospital absorbing the doctorâ€™s prognosis: â€œWe know Greta is going to die, all of us, although we havenâ€™t allowed the thought into our conscious minds yet.
None of us is ready for it to maraud through our subconscious, killing and burning everything it sees.
But we hear banging at the gates.
We glance around us, realizing this is the last weâ€™ll ever see of the world as weâ€™ve known it.
Whatever comes next will raze everything to the ground.â€ You will read it and cry and hug your children tighter.
Iâ€™ve always given Sidneys to individual essays, but this year it seems right to give one to an entire issue of a magazine, the December issue of The Atlantic, titled â€œHow to Stop a Civil War.â€ That issue felt like a civic act.
Iâ€™d particularly recommend Yoni Appelbaumâ€™s essay, â€œHow America Ends,â€ which captures the political moment we are in.
America is undergoing a demographic revolution, with the dominant white majority becoming a minority.
Weâ€™re also at a moment when hyperpartisans fear that losing an election will be more catastrophic than losing our democracy.
Such people are willing to destroy democratic norms to stay in power (look around you).
Appelbaum also argues that the key to the countryâ€™s future is building a healthy center-right.
As someone whoâ€™s worked on this problem for 25 years, I say good luck with that.
Iâ€™d also recommend Caitlin Flanaganâ€™s â€œThe Dishonesty of the Abortion Debateâ€ from that issue.
Flanagan does something that should be more common: She takes the most vivid arguments from each side of a controversy and she jams them into one essay.
The most vivid argument of the pro-choice side is the back-alley and other dangerous abortions that result when you make the procedure illegal and the women who die as a result.
Flanagan takes you there.
The most vivid argument of the pro-life side is the sonogram, and the growing evidence that cognitive life begins sooner than we thought.
These images, Flanagan writes, â€œare proof that what grows within a pregnant womanâ€™s body is a human being, living and unfolding according to a timetable that has existed as long as we have.
Obviously, it would take a profound act of violence to remove him from his quiet world and destroy him.â€ Thereâ€™s a reason this debate is so hard.
On a lighter note, Sports Illustrated had an essay by Emma Baccellieri, called â€œMud Maker: The Man Behind MLBâ€™s Essential Secret Sauce.â€ In 1920, the Cleveland Indians shortstop Ray Chapman was killed when a pitch hit him in the head.
Baseball needed a way to help pitchers have greater control of their pitches.
The solution was to coat the balls with a thin layer of mud, thus improving their grip.
Jim Bintliff is the man who collects that mud, with shovels and buckets, from a secret spot along the Delaware River.
His mud now coats roughly 240,000 balls per season.
The story is about Bintliff, who cultivates the mud as if it were fine wine.
â€œI know the mud.
Iâ€™m the only one on the planet who does,â€ he says.
In â€œThe Day the Dinosaurs Died,â€ in The New Yorker, Douglas Preston describes what happened when an asteroid struck the earth 66 million years ago, the most significant event in the history of our planet.
Twenty-five trillion metric tons of debris were thrown up into the atmosphere.
The energy released was more powerful than a billion Hiroshima bombs.
A mountain rose up higher than Mount Everest.
Fires consumed 70 percent of the worldâ€™s forests and killed 99.9999 percent of all living organisms.
Prestonâ€™s tale gets more astounding from there.
In â€œMagic Eraser Juice,â€ in Hazlitt, Elizabeth Rosen describes what itâ€™s like to be an E.M.T.
in the age of the opioid epidemic.
The piece is gripping throughout but especially when sheâ€™s describing how people who have overdosed are brought back to life when she administers Narcan.
Some are overcome with grief that they have fallen so low.
Others are nonchalant: â€œOh, Iâ€™ve ODâ€™d a bunch of times.â€  I hope everybody has read Richard Powersâ€™s phenomenal novel â€œThe Overstory,â€ about how trees communicate (and a lot more).
Robert Macfarlaneâ€™s essay â€œThe Understory,â€ in Emergence Magazine, is even more astounding, explaining how trees communicate underground.
One of the ways they do it is through hyphae, which are superfine threads that fungi send out through the soil to create an interconnected social network.
A single teaspoonful of soil can hold up to seven miles of hyphae.
I found the American Scholar essay â€œHow I Learned to Talk,â€ by Emily Fox Gordon, a pure delight.
When she was a young woman, Gordon found a psychoanalyst, Leslie Farber, who didnâ€™t try to force epiphanies and breakthrough â€œAha!â€ moments.
He didnâ€™t treat therapy as work.
He saw it as an occasion for friendship and beautiful talk.
This kind of talk, Gordon writes, â€œis playful and gratuitous.
Though it often contains elements of argument and analysis, its first aim is not to solve problems.
In the case of Farberâ€™s practice, any therapeutic benefit lay in the talk itself, the self-forgetting human connection that can lift a person out of desperate isolation and remind him that in the future such reprieves will continue to be possible.â€ Gordonâ€™s narrative voice is lovely and wise.
Farber is someone we would all like to have known â€” and can through this essay.
The final Sidney winner is a bit of a cheat.
â€œCop Diaryâ€ by Edward Conlon was first published in The New Yorker in 1997 and was reposted this year by The Sun.
Itâ€™s certainly the most realistic description of police work that I have read.
â€œI take prisoners,â€ Conlon writes, â€œand to exercise that authority is to invoke a profound social trust.
Each time a surgeon undertakes the responsibility of cutting open a human being, it should be awesome and new, no matter how necessary the operation, no matter how routine.
A police officer who takes away someoneâ€™s freedom bears a burden of at least equal gravity.
Let me tell you, itâ€™s a pleasure sometimes.â€  When I read these essays at the end of the year, I feel like Iâ€™ve been given gifts and a deeper appreciation of the reality around us.
When I spend the rest of the year following impeachment on Twitter, not so much.
A lot of people help me find great essays each year, but Iâ€™m especially grateful to Robert Cottrell, who runs one of my favorite spots on the web, The Browser; Conor Friedersdorf, whose The Best in Journalism newsletter is a weekly dose of intellectual nutrition; and Robert Atwan, who runs The Best American Essays series at Houghton Mifflin.
All three are generous with their time and erudition.

The Three Crucial Flaws in Trumpâ€™s â€˜Peace Visionâ€™ By Micah Goodman Jan. 29, 2020  President Trumpâ€™s â€œUltimate Dealâ€ for Israeli-Palestinian peace isnâ€™t ultimate, and it isnâ€™t quite a deal.
Released on Tuesday, the plan â€” or â€œPeace Vision,â€ as itâ€™s called in its official document â€” has three flaws.
None are fatal.
First, the dissonance between its pretension and its timing: It purports to change history, but coming just one month before Israelâ€™s elections, it serves petty politics.
Second, there is a mismatch between the planâ€™s stated aim and the actors who are meant to put it into place: It seeks to bring peace between Israel and the Palestinians, but the Palestinians are not full partners in its implementation.
Third, and the biggest problem: The plan doesnâ€™t meet the Palestiniansâ€™ minimum conditions.
Can anyone imagine that the Palestinians, who have previously rejected plans that offered them nearly 100 percent of the West Bank, might be happy with just 70 percent?
The peace plan, in other words, will not bring peace.
But these three flaws should not distract us from the big opportunity the plan presents: It cleverly redivides, even temporarily, the territories in dispute.
This division can rearrange the conflict.
If put in place, the plan would create a Palestinian state with almost full sovereignty on some 70 percent of the West Bank, while fully addressing Israelâ€™s security needs.
The conflict would not end, but it would be functionally different.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a conflict between occupiers and the occupied.
But after the plan it would become a conflict between two separate political entities â€” and thatâ€™s an entirely new paradigm.
This should be the planâ€™s big ambition: Instead of seeking to end the battle, it should fundamentally redraw the battle lines.
The problem with the â€œUltimate Dealâ€ is the mismatch between the plan and its stated aim.
As a peace plan, itâ€™s laughable.
But sometimes, all thatâ€™s needed to fix a problem is to rethink the purpose of the solution.
And here, we can stop pretending that the United States plan will end the conflict, and admit that it might be better at transforming its character.
And with more modest goals, it might enjoy better success.
To turn the Trump administrationâ€™s proposal from a bad plan to end the conflict into a good plan to transform the conflict, all references to ending the conflict should be removed.
The Palestinians cannot be expected to recognize Israel as a Jewish state, formally renounce the right of return or sign a document announcing an â€œend to claims.â€  What would Israel gain from a plan to reconfigure the conflict?
Plenty.
Most Israelis are trapped between two national aspirations.
On the one hand, they donâ€™t want to rule over the Palestinian people, but on the other, they donâ€™t want to live under the threat of rockets from a Palestinian state.
The tension between these two impulses has paralyzed Israelâ€™s ability to address the conflict.
A plan to reconfigure the conflict would dramatically reduce Israelâ€™s control over the Palestinians and do so without putting Israel in danger.
In other words, for Israelis, the Trump plan would smash the zero-sum game between security and ending the occupation.
Israelis would be able to greatly reduce their rule over the Palestinians without being any more threatened by them.
And what do the Palestinians stand to gain from a plan to reconfigure the conflict?
Also plenty.
The Palestinians, too, are trapped.
On the one hand, they want an independent state of their own, but on the other, most of them want the Palestinian refugees to â€œreturnâ€ â€” that is, to be relocated to Israel.
Moreover, a large section of Palestinian society is unwilling to recognize non-Muslim sovereignty over any part of the Holy Land.
Reconciling with Israel would be a religious concession, and relinquishing the â€œright of returnâ€ would be a national concession.
For many Palestinians, those two concessions would mean renouncing their most sacred beliefs, which form a part of Palestinian identity.
For many years, the various peace plans proposed to the Palestinians expected them to forgo these two axioms.
But the Palestinians have always refused a deal in which they would have to relinquish core elements of their national identity as the price for independence.
A plan to rearrange the conflict would give the Palestinians a state without expecting them to pay for it by renouncing their demand for a right of return and thereby conceding a plank of their national identity.
Under the plan, the new Palestinian state will not be completely sovereign, but it will be mostly sovereign, and the elements of the occupation that immiserate Palestinians in their day-to-day lives â€” namely restrictions on movement, construction and economic growth â€” will be swept away.
In other words, any plan would need to drop the pretense of realizing either sideâ€™s perfect deal.
This plan begins to do that.
Under it, the Palestinians could dramatically enhance their sovereignty without conceding their aspirations, and Israel should control far fewer Palestinians without conceding its security.
Neither side will give up on what is truly important to it, and both will reduce what is truly painful.
It wonâ€™t be peace.
It wonâ€™t be a new Middle East.
But it will be progress.
Conflicts between neighbors are not only healthier than conflicts between occupiers and the occupied â€” they are also more likely to support negotiations.
Talks in the future would be between two sovereign states.
In other words, reconfiguring the conflict will create new opportunities to continue shrinking it.
Itâ€™s time to stop devoting our energy and political capital to ending the conflict in a single, â€œUltimate Deal,â€ and start focusing on a much more modest mission â€” transforming its nature.
Instead of rejecting the plan â€” we should think again about what it can and should realistically achieve.
Thatâ€™s the way to break through the deadlock, minimize suffering and forge a new reality.
The White House Motto: Watch Your Back By Michelle Cottle Nov. 14, 2019  Thereâ€™s no honor among thieves nor, apparently, among anxious political hacks who bound themselves to a president with a penchant for subordinating the national interest to his own.
Once-eager presidential enablers have turned on one another with feral abandon as the facts of what Mr. Trumpâ€™s flunkies were doing in Ukraine have become clear and the impeachment investigation moves into its public phase.
John Bolton, the former national security adviser, appears to be spoiling for a fight.
He has a deal worth around $2 million to write a book about his time in the administration, which he left on not-so-friendly terms in September.
In a private speech last week, Mr. Bolton offered a harsh assessment of the presidentâ€™s foreign-policy chops and suggested that Mr. Trumpâ€™s policy toward Turkey has been driven by personal and business interests, according to NBC News.
Mr. Boltonâ€™s lawyer told impeachment investigators that Mr. Bolton has information about â€œmany relevant meetings and conversationsâ€ concerning Ukraine that he might be willing to share if the courts give him the go-ahead.
Mr. Bolton is awaiting the outcome of a lawsuit brought by his former deputy, Charles Kupperman, asking the courts to decide whether a congressional subpoena outweighs the presidentâ€™s order to ignore it.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, tried to glom onto Mr. Kuppermanâ€™s lawsuit, but Mr. Bolton was having none of it.
On Monday, a lawyer who represents both him and Mr. Kupperman asked a judge to deny Mr. Mulvaneyâ€™s request, citing, among other objections, that Mr. Mulvaney may have waived any immunity from testifying when he acknowledged in a news conference last month that Mr. Trump had sought a quid pro quo from Ukraine in exchange for military aid and said that people needed to â€œget over it.â€  Mr. Mulvaney, who subsequently insisted he hadnâ€™t said what he said, was a key player in the pressure campaign to have Ukraine announce an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, while Mr. Bolton reportedly said he wanted nothing to do with â€œthe drug dealâ€ Mr. Mulvaney was â€œcooking upâ€ with Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union.
Surprised by the blowback, Mr. Mulvaney dropped his court request and now says he will abide by the presidentâ€™s edict not to cooperate.
Even so, he has been clashing with Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, over what each sees as the otherâ€™s mishandling of the presidentâ€™s impeachment defense.
Mr. Mulvaney also faces danger from House Republicans looking for someone to blame other than Mr. Trump for the Ukraine mess.
He is among the most promising scapegoats, according to The Washington Post, along with the presidentâ€™s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Mr. Sondland, two of the principal players.
But Mr. Mulvaney has implied to people that he knows too much to be fired.
Mr. Giuliani, now under criminal investigation over his Ukraine dealings, is facing newly revealed accusations from his â€œassociateâ€ Lev Parnas.
Mr. Parnas says Mr. Giuliani directed him to help pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Mr. Trumpâ€™s political rival.
For his part, Mr. Giuliani is contemplating starting an impeachment-themed podcast, which should terrify everyone concerned.
The president, meanwhile, is said to want to fire not only Mr. Mulvaney but also the inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, who alerted Congress to the whistle-blower complaint, kicking off the impeachment inquiry.
More publicly, Mr. Trump has been berating Republican lawmakers for suggesting that his behavior toward Ukraine was anything other than â€œPERFECTâ€ â€” as he has taken to ranting on Twitter.
While Secretary of State Mike Pompeo isnâ€™t under attack from his peers â€” yet â€” there are warning flags.
Last month, his former senior adviser Michael McKinley told investigators that Mr. Pompeo ignored his pleas to protect Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, who became the target of a Giuliani smear campaign that contributed to her ouster from Kiev â€” pleas that the secretary claims never to have heard.
Who knows where this could lead?
Even White House players not directly tied to impeachment are getting in on the action.
Peddling her new memoir, Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations, has been accusing former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former White House chief of staff John Kelly of having sought her aid in undermining the presidentâ€™s policy aims during their time in the administration.
For his part, Mr. Kelly says he warned the president before being pushed out that if he were replaced by a â€œyes man,â€ Mr. Trump would end up being impeached.
(Looking at you, Mick.)
Then thereâ€™s â€œAnonymous,â€ the senior administration official who published a September 2018 Op-Ed in The Times, who is out with a new tell-all book painting an unflattering picture of the president and charging, â€œThe White House, quite simply, is broken.â€  To be fair, with so many people having been pulled â€” willingly or otherwise â€” into Mr. Trumpâ€™s Ukraine scheme, it can be hard for the lackeys to keep their stories straight and avoid incriminating even themselves.
For instance, Mr. Sondland originally told impeachment investigators that he had no knowledge of a quid pro quo involving Ukraine.
Less than three weeks later, he amended his testimony to say that he did recall telling Ukrainian officials that they were unlikely to receive their promised military aid until they publicly announced the investigations sought by Mr. Trump.
This recovered memory brought Mr. Sondlandâ€™s testimony more into line with that of other witnesses.
All this should serve as a warning for the presidentâ€™s many apologists.
As the impeachment inquiry grinds on, the circular firing squad is likely to grow still larger â€” and potentially armed with higher-caliber ammunition.
The Wisdom Your Body Knows By David Brooks Nov. 28, 2019  This has been a golden age for brain research.
We now have amazing brain scans that show which networks in the brain ramp up during different activities.
But this emphasis on the brain has subtly fed the illusion that thinking happens only from the neck up.
Itâ€™s fed the illusion that the advanced parts of our thinking are the â€œrationalâ€ parts up top that try to control the more â€œprimitiveâ€ parts down below.
So itâ€™s interesting how many scientists are now focusing on the thinking that happens not in your brain but in your gut.
You have neurons spread through your innards, and thereâ€™s increasing attention on the vagus nerve, which emerges from the brain stem and wanders across the heart, lungs, kidney and gut.
The vagus nerve is one of the pathways through which the body and brain talk to each other in an unconscious conversation.
Much of this conversation is about how we are relating to others.
Human thinking is not primarily about individual calculation, but about social engagement and cooperation.
One of the leaders in this field is Stephen W. Porges of Indiana University.
When you enter a new situation, Porges argues, your body reacts.
Your heart rate may go up.
Your blood pressure may change.
Signals go up to the brain, which records the â€œautonomic stateâ€ you are in.
Maybe you walk into a social situation that feels welcoming.
Green light.
Your brain and body get prepared for a friendly conversation.
But maybe the person in front of you feels threatening.
Yellow light.
You go into fight-or-flight mode.
Your body instantly changes.
Your ear, for example, adjusts to hear high and low frequencies â€” a scream or a growl â€” rather than midrange frequencies, human speech.
Or maybe the threat feels like a matter of life and death.
Red light.
Your brain and body begin to shut down.
According to Porgesâ€™s â€œPolyvagal Theory,â€ the concept of safety is fundamental to our mental state.
People who have experienced trauma have bodies that are highly reactive to perceived threat.
They donâ€™t like public places with loud noises.
They live in fight-or-flight mode, stressed and anxious.
Or, if they feel trapped and constrained, they go numb.
Their voice and tone go flat.
Physical reactions shape our way of seeing and being.
Lisa Feldman Barrett, of Northeastern University, also argues that a main purpose of the brain is to read the body, and to regulate what she calls the body budget.
You may see a bully on the playground.
Your brain then predicts your next action and speeds your heart rate and breathing to deal with it.
You experience these changes as emotion â€” oh, this is fear or oh, this is anger â€” because your brain has created an emotion concept to make those physical changes meaningful.
â€œYou might think that in everyday life, the things you see and hear influence what you feel, but itâ€™s mostly the other way around: What you feel alters your sight and hearing,â€ Barrett writes in â€œHow Emotions Are Made.â€  When weâ€™re really young we know few emotion concepts.
Young children say, â€œMommy, I hate you!â€ when they mean â€œI donâ€™t like thisâ€ because they havenâ€™t learned their cultureâ€™s concepts for hatred vs. badness.
But as we get older we learn more emotional granularity.
The emotionally wise person can create distinct experiences of disappointment, anger, spite, resentment, grouchiness and aggravation, whereas for a less emotionally wise person those are all synonyms for â€œI feel bad.â€  A wise person may know the foreign words that express emotions we canâ€™t name in English: tocka (Russian, roughly, for spiritual anguish) or litost (Czech, roughly, for misery combined with the hunger for revenge).
People with high emotional granularity respond flexibly to life, have better mental health outcomes and drink less.
If bodily reactions can drive people apart they can also heal.
Martha G. Welch of Columbia University points to the importance of loving physical touch, especially in the first 1,000 minutes of life, to lay down markers of emotional stability.
Under the old brain-only paradigm, Welch argues, we told people to self-regulate their emotions through conscious self-talk.
But real emotional help comes through co-regulation.
When a mother and a child physically hold each other, their bodily autonomic states harmonize, connecting on a metabolic level.
Together they move from separate distress to mutual calm.
Welch has created something called the Welch Emotional Connection Screen, which measures the emotional connection between mothers and pre-term babies.
By encouraging this kind of deep visceral connection through 18 months, her therapy can mitigate the effects of autism.
When you step back and see the brain and body thinking together, the old distinction between reason and emotion doesnâ€™t seem to make sense.
Your very perception of the world is shaped by the predictions your brain is making about your physical autonomic states.
You also see how important it is to teach emotional granularity, something our culture pays almost no attention to.
You also see that weâ€™re not separate brains, coolly observing each other.
Weâ€™re physical viscera, deeply interacting with each other.
The important communication is happening at a much deeper level.
Trump Has Made Us All Stupid By David Brooks  Donald Trump is impulse-driven, ignorant, narcissistic and intellectually dishonest.
So youâ€™d think that those of us in the anti-Trump camp would go out of our way to show weâ€™re not like him â€” that we are judicious, informed, mature and reasonable.
But the events of the past week have shown that the anti-Trump echo chamber is becoming a mirror image of Trump himself â€” overwrought, uncalibrated and incapable of having an intelligent conversation about any complex policy problem.
For example, thereâ€™s a complex policy problem at the heart of this weekâ€™s Iran episode.
Iran is not powerful because it has a strong economy or military.
It is powerful because it sponsors militias across the Middle East, destabilizing regimes and spreading genocide and sectarian cleansing.
Over the past few years those militias, orchestrated by Qassim Suleimani, have felt free to operate more in the open with greater destructive effect.
Weâ€™re not going to go in and destroy the militias.
So how can we keep them in check so they donâ€™t destabilize the region?
Thatâ€™s the hard problem â€” one that stymied past administrations.
In the Middle East, and wherever there are protracted conflicts, nations have a way to address this problem.
They use violence as a form of communication.
A nation trying to maintain order will assassinate a terrorism leader or destroy a terrorism facility.
The attack says: â€œHey, we know weâ€™re in a long-term conflict, but letâ€™s not let it get out of hand.
Thatâ€™s not in either of our interests.â€  The attack is a way to seize control of the escalation process and set a boundary marker.
These sorts of operations have risks and rewards.
A risk is that it wonâ€™t cease the escalation, just accelerate it.
The radicals on the other side will get enraged and take to the streets.
Their leaders will have to appease that rage.
A reward is that maybe you do halt the escalation.
The other side implicitly says: â€œMessage received.
Weâ€™ll do some face-saving things to appease the streets, but we donâ€™t want this to get out of hand, either.â€ Another reward is that youâ€™ve managed to eliminate an effective terrorist like Suleimani.
Talent doesnâ€™t grow on trees.
The decision to undertake this sort of operation is a matter of weighing risk and reward.
And after the Suleimani killing, you saw American security professionals talk in the language of balancing risk and reward.
Stanley McChrystal, a retired general, and Michael Mullen, a retired admiral, thought it was worth the risk.
Susan Rice, a former national security adviser, thought it wasnâ€™t.
But in the anti-Trump echo chamber, thatâ€™s not how most people were thinking.
Led by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, they avoided the hard, complex problem of how to set boundaries around militias.
Instead, they pontificated on the easy question not actually on the table: Should we have a massive invasion of Iran?
A great cry went up from the echo chamber.
Weâ€™re on the brink of war!
Trump is leading us to more endless wars in the Middle East!
Weâ€™re on the precipice of total chaos!
This was not the calibrated language of risk and reward.
It was fear-stoking apocalyptic language.
By being so overwrought and exaggerated, the echo chamber drowned out any practical conversation about how to stabilize the Middle East so we could have another righteous chorus of â€œDonald Trump is a monster!â€  This is Trumpâ€™s ultimate victory.
Every argument on every topic is now all about him.
Hating Trump together has become the ultimate bonding, attention-grabbing and profit-maximization mechanism for those of us in anti-Trump world.
So you get a series of exaggerated fervors â€” the Mueller report!
Impeachment!
The Steele dossier!
â€” that lead ultimately nowhere.
Most of this weekâ€™s argument about the Middle East wasnâ€™t really about the Middle East.
It was all narcissistically about ourselves!
Democrats defend terrorists!
Republicans are warmongers!
Actual Iranians are just bit players in our imperialistic soap opera, the passive recipients of our greatness or perfidy.
The world is more complicated than this cartoon.
Love or hate him, Trump has used military force less than any other president since Jimmy Carter.
When it comes to foreign policy, he is not like recent Republicans.
He is, as my colleague Ross Douthat put it, a Jacksonian figure, wanting to get America out of foreign entanglements while lobbing a few long-distance attacks to ensure the crazy foreigners stick to killing one another and not us.
And this is the final paradox.
For all the Sturm und Drang that surrounds Trump, populist Republicans and Democrats are gravitating toward the same foreign policy: Weâ€™re in the middle of a clash of civilizations; the Middle East is so screwed up, we should just get out; weâ€™re too stupid/ineffective/racist/imperialistic to do any good there anyway.
We fight viciously about Trump, but underneath, a populist left-right curtain is descending around America, separating us from the Mideast, China, even Europe.
The real high-risk move is the one both parties are making together: that if we ignore the world it will ignore us.
(It wonâ€™t.)
Maybe once the Inflammatory One is finally gone from the scene we can have an intelligent conversation about that.
Trumpâ€™s Contempt for True Professionals By Frank Bruni Nov. 12, 2019  The impeachment inquiry and the events that led to it tell many stories.
One, obviously, is about the abuse of power.
Another illuminates the foul mash of mendacity and paranoia at the core of Donald Trump.
But this week, as several longtime civil servants testify at the inquiryâ€™s first public hearings, a third narrative demands notice, because it explains the entire tragedy of the Trump administration: the larger scandals, the lesser disgraces and the current moment of reckoning.
That story is the collision of a president who has absolutely no regard for professionalism and those who try to embody it, the battle between an arrogant, unscrupulous yahoo and his humble, principled opposites.
Right now the opposites have the microphone.
I mean William Taylor, Americaâ€™s top diplomat in Ukraine, who is, tellingly, the first impeachment witness to testify on live television.
Stephanie Grisham, the White Houseâ€™s peerlessly nasty press secretary, has sought to discredit Taylorâ€™s account of the pressure on Ukraineâ€™s new president by saying that he belonged to a cabal of â€œradical unelected bureaucrats.â€  Hardly.
Heâ€™s a West Point graduate and Vietnam veteran with a half-century career thatâ€™s devoid of obvious partisanship and entirely about the public good.
He took the Ukraine post despite profound qualms because he felt he owed his country his expertise.
Heâ€™s a creature of duty and discipline and earnestly accrued knowledge â€” all precious commodities that are worthless in Trumpâ€™s eyes.
In other words, heâ€™s a true professional, and it was as such that he recoiled from what Trump, Rudy Giuliani and the wretched rest of them were up to.
Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, has a diplomatic rÃ©sumÃ© thatâ€™s three decades long and includes three ambassadorships, an unusual feat.
The fault that Giuliani and Trump found in her was her respect for correct procedure, her resistance to corrupt politics and her reluctance to tweet out dopey praise for the president.
They quibbled with her professionalism, which had no place in their schemes.
Trumpâ€™s disregard â€” no, contempt â€” for professionalism is in some ways an anagram of his aversion to norms, to tradition, to simple courtesy.
Or at least these attitudes exist as a Venn diagram with enormous overlap.
Theyâ€™re hostile to any set of values that places personal glory below other ideals.
But Trumpâ€™s war on professionalism and professionals is also its own distinct theme in his business career, which is rife with cheating, and his political life, which is greased with lies.
Go back to his initial staffing of senior posts and recall how shoddy the vetting process was.
Also notice two prominent classes of recruits: people who had profoundly questionable preparation for the jobs that he nonetheless gave them (Ben Carson, Betsy DeVos, Stephen Miller, Javanka) and genuine professionals who wagered that their skills would be critically necessary â€” and thus highly valued â€” and that Trump would surely rise to the established codes and expected conduct of his office.
Now look at how many of those professionals (James Mattis, H.R.
McMaster, Gary Cohn, Dan Coats) are gone.
And tell me whether Trump has ever had the epiphany that the presidency is, in fact, a profession.
A crisis of professionalism defines his administration, in which backstabbing is the new glad-handing, firings are cruel, exits are ugly, the turnover is jaw-dropping, the number of unfilled positions is mind-boggling, and many officials have titles that are prefaced with â€œactingâ€ â€” a modifier with multiple meanings in this case.
Trump slyly markets his anti-professionalism as anti-elitism and a rejection of staid, cautious thinking.
But itâ€™s really his way of excusing his ignorance, costuming his incompetence and greenlighting his hooliganism.
He rejects professionalism because it tempers self-promotion and forbids such grandiose claims as his insistence that he knows more about the Islamic State than any military general.
â€œI alone can fix it,â€ he boasted at the Republican convention in 2016. â€œIâ€™m the only one that matters,â€ he said the following year when dismissing any concerns about job vacancies.
A true professional would have trouble uttering those words.
They roll easily off a true hucksterâ€™s tongue.
Professionalism involves credentials, benchmarks, all sorts of yardsticks by which a person can be judged, sometimes unkindly.
Trump wants only affirmation.
And professionalism is a reality-based enterprise.
Trump prefers fiction: The Ukraine call was â€œperfect.â€ â€œRead the transcriptâ€ because it exonerates him.
His critics are partisan hacks.
Heâ€™s the target of an interminable â€œwitch hunt.â€  But Robert Mueller was no more hunting witches than Bill Taylor is an agent of the deep state.
In fact Mueller stands out as a consummate professional, so much so that he politically neutered himself, and â€œdeep stateâ€ is Trumpâ€™s deeply cynical pejorative for â€œseasoned professionals.â€  Itâ€™s the professionals who keep pushing back at him, whether at the Federal Reserve, the Birmingham, Ala., office of the National Weather Service or the State Department, which is where Taylor, Yovanovitch and this weekâ€™s other impeachment witness, George Kent, worked.
Michael McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Russia, wrote about Taylor and Yovanovitch recently in an essay for The New York Review of Books titled â€œThe Deeply Dedicated State,â€ observing: â€œBoth always have struck me as first-rate government servants, singularly focused on advancing American national interests.
Both have served Republican and Democratic presidents, and even after decades of interacting with them both, I could not guess how either of them votes.â€  He characterized them as â€œaccidental heroesâ€ who arenâ€™t â€œlikely to seek the limelight.â€ â€œThey are extremely well trained, competent, and highly regarded professionals,â€ he summarized.
Thatâ€™s why they bucked Trump.
And thatâ€™s why he canâ€™t bear them.
Trumpâ€™s Digital Advantage Is Freaking Out Democratic Strategists By Thomas B. Edsall Jan. 29, 2020  In a blog post published in November, a year before the 2020 election, Brian Burch, the president of CatholicVote.org, a socially conservative advocacy group, announced that in Wisconsin alone his organization had identified 199,241 Catholics â€œwhoâ€™ve been to church at least 3 times in the last 90 days.â€  Nearly half of these religiously observant parishioners, Burch wrote, â€œ91,373 mass-attending Catholics â€” are not even registered to vote!â€ CatholicVote.org is looking for potential Trump voters within this large, untapped reservoir â€” Republican-leaning white Catholics who could bolster Trumpâ€™s numbers in a battleground state.
Burch, whose organization opposes abortion and gay marriage, made his plans clear:  We are already building the largest Catholic voter mobilization program ever.
And no, thatâ€™s not an exaggeration.
Our plan spans at least 7 states (and growing), and includes millions of Catholic voters.
How did Catholic Vote come up with these particular church attendance numbers for 199,241 Catholics?
With geofencing, a technology that creates a virtual geographic boundary, enabling software to trigger a response when a cellphone enters or leaves a particular area â€” a church, for example, or a stadium, a school or an entire town.
Geofencing is just one of the new tools of digital campaigning, a largely unregulated field of political combat in which voters have little or no idea of how they are being manipulated, in which traditional disclosure requirements are inoperative and key actors are anonymous.
It is a weapon of choice.
Once an area is geofenced, commercial data companies can acquire the mobile phone ID numbers of those within the boundary.
This is how the National Catholic Reporter described the process in an article earlier this month:  Politically minded geofencers capture data from the cellphones of churchgoers, and then purchase ads targeting those devices.
That data can be matched against other easily obtained databases, including voter profiles, which give marketers identifying information such as names, addresses and voter registration status.
Such information can be a gold mine.
Burch described what CatholicVote.org initiated in the 2018 election.
â€œWe created ad campaigns targeted to mobile devices that have been inside of Catholic churches,â€ Burch explained.
Whatâ€™s more,  We told Catholics in Missouri the truth about then-Senator Claire McCaskill â€” that she was pro-abortion, was unwilling to protect the Little Sisters of the Poor, and opposed Catholic judicial nominees because of their religious beliefs.
And she lost.
If you attend an evangelical or a Catholic Church, a womenâ€™s rights march or a political rally of any kind, especially in a seriously contested state, the odds are that your cellphone ID number, home address, partisan affiliation and the identifying information of the people around you will be provided by geofencing marketers to campaigns, lobbyists and other interest groups.
With increasing speed, digital technology is transforming politics, constantly providing novel ways to target specific individuals, to get the unregistered registered, to turn out marginal voters, to persuade the undecided and to suppress support for the opposition.
Democrats and Republicans agree that the Trump campaign is far ahead of the Democratic Party in the use of this technology, capitalizing on its substantial investment during the 2016 election and benefiting from an uninterrupted high-tech drive since then.
Republicans â€œhave a big advantage this time,â€ Ben Nuckels, a Democratic media consultant said in a phone interview.
â€œThey not only have all the data from 2016 but they have been building this operation into a nonstop juggernaut.â€  The new technology, Nuckels continued, allows campaigns to â€œdeliver a broader narrative over the topâ€ on television and other media, while â€œunderneath in digital you are delivering ads that are tailored to those voters that you need to influence and persuade the most.â€  The explosion of digital technology has created the opportunity for political operatives to run what amount to dark campaigns, conducted below the radar of both voter awareness and government oversight.
In some cases, the technology is very simple: the anonymous transmission of negative images of candidates by individuals to Facebook groups.
This activity is neither reported to the Federal Election Commission nor linked to official campaigns.
Steven Livingston, a professor of media and public affairs and director of the Institute for Data, Democracy and Politics at George Washington University, has been tracking this sub rosa electioneering in the current election cycle.
He found that supporters of two candidates, Trump and Bernie Sanders, are the primary practitioners.
The Washington Post and The New York Times have both reported on the activities of Sanders supporters, but, Livingston noted in an email, â€œOur evidence suggests that Trump supporters use automated promotion or cross posting four times as much as Sanders supporters.â€  Livingston described â€œthese digital shadow campaignsâ€ as â€œanalogous to and perhaps an actual digital manifestation of â€˜dark moneyâ€™ influence campaigns.â€ In addition, he continued,  Overwhelmingly, these pages and groups do not have ownership declarations or Facebook verifications.
We simply do not know what other digital properties might be operated by common sources with the groups.
There is money being spent but we donâ€™t know the sources.
It is unaccountable spending.
Livingston provided some of the kind of negative messages and images promoted by anonymous pro-Trump activists.
Here is one:  And here is one made by a Sanders enthusiast:  Experts in the explosively growing field of political digital technologies have developed an innovative terminology to describe what they do â€” a lexicon that is virtually incomprehensible to ordinary voters.
This language provides an inkling of the extraordinarily arcane universe politics has entered:  geofencing, mass personalization, dark patterns, identity resolution technologies, dynamic prospecting, geotargeting strategies, location analytics, geo-behavioural segment, political data cloud, automatic content recognition, dynamic creative optimization.
Geofencing and other emerging digital technologies derive from microtargeting marketing initiatives that use consumer and other demographic data to identify the interests of specific voters or very small groups of like-minded individuals to influence their thoughts or actions.
Microtargeting first had a significant impact on American politics in state level campaign work by Alec Gage, a Republican, and his firm TargetPoint in 2002.
Now, political operatives are exploiting commercial techniques to correlate microtargeting data with the identification numbers of cellphones.
This allows campaigns to mobilize, persuade and turn out â€” or to suppress turnout among â€” key voters.
In 2016, Trump spent far more than Hillary Clinton on digital campaigning, and since then his campaign, under the direction of Brad Parscale, has continued far outpace its Democratic rivals.
In a paper published this month, â€œThe digital commercialization of US politics â€” 2020 and beyond,â€ Kathryn Montgomery, a professor of communications at American University, and Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, described the differences between the 2016 Trump and Clinton campaigns:  Whereas 31 percent of Donald Trumpâ€™s total campaign expenditures were for digital media, only 6 percent of Hillary Clintonâ€™s expenditures were for digital.
Moreover, whereas almost 50 percent of Mr. Trumpâ€™s media expenditures were for digital, only 8 percent of Secretary Clintonâ€™s media expenditures were for digital.
So although Secretary Clinton outspent Mr. Trump by $75 million on media, it is quite possible that Mr. Trumpâ€™s heavy reliance on digital media allowed for a more efficient and targeted ad campaign that escaped the eye.
Parscale, who is now managing Trumpâ€™s 2020 campaign, claimed in a 2018 tweet that the Trump campaign tech operation was â€œ100 times to 200 timesâ€ more effective than the Clinton campaignâ€™s, adding â€œ@realDonaldTrump was a perfect candidate for Facebook.â€  On Monday, Parscale boasted on the conservative website Townhall that Trump rallies are providing a gold mine of data for the 2020 election:  Out of more than 20,000 identified voters who came to a recent Trump rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 57.9 percent did not have a history of voting for Republicans.
Remarkably, 4,413 attendees didnâ€™t even vote in the last election â€” a clear indication that President Trump is energizing Americans who were previously not engaged in politics.
Similar findings are coming out of other rallies, according to Parscale:  Nearly 22 percent of identified supporters at President Trumpâ€™s rally in Toledo, Ohio, were Democrats, and another 21 percent were independents.
An astounding 15 percent of identified voters who saw the president speak in Battle Creek, Michigan, has not voted in any of the last four elections.
In Hershey, Pennsylvania, just over 20 percent of identified voters at the rally were Democrats, and 18 percent were nonwhite.
In the current election cycle, Montgomery and Chester write,  further growth and expansion of the big data digital marketplace is reshaping electoral politics in the US, introducing both candidate and issue campaigns to a system of sophisticated software applications and data-targeting tools that are rooted in the goals, values, and strategies for influencing consumer behaviors.
Technologies used for â€œidentity resolution,â€ they write,  enable marketers â€” and political groups â€” to target and â€˜reach real peopleâ€™ with greater precision than ever before.
Marketers are helping perfect a system that leverages and integrates, increasingly in real-time, consumer profile data with online behaviors to capture more granular profiles of individuals, including where they go, and what they do.
The authors go on to warn that â€œall of these developments are taking place, moreover, within a regulatory structure that is weak and largely ineffectual.â€  Tara McGowan, executive director of the recently created pro-Democratic group Acronym, which plans to spend $75 million on digital and other media, replied to my questions by email:  Thereâ€™s no digital dark magic being deployed by Brad Parscale and the Trump campaign.
They just have near unlimited resources and are spending them wisely to reach their voters where they are â€” online, and especially on platforms like Facebook.
The greatest advantage, McGowan continued, that  the Trump campaign has over Democrats heading into 2020 is time.
Democrats may not settle on a general election nominee until late spring or summer.
That gives the Trump campaign much more time to talk to voters and define the Democrats in places where it counts.
In addition to ACRONYM, pro-Democratic groups like Priorities USA, American Bridge, America Votes and a host of others are working together, prepared to spend more than $300 million to counter the Trump efforts.
In addition, the campaigns of Mike Bloomberg, Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer are all spending huge amounts of money on digital strategies focused on Facebook, Google and other social media.
Still, there are concerns that much of the Democratic spending will have limited value in the general election, insofar as it is going toward states that will not be 2020 battlegrounds, including, for example, Alabama, Arkansas, California, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah and Vermont on Tuesday March 3, better known as Super Tuesday.
In addition, whoever becomes the Democratic nominee will not be able to share his or her data with the independent pro-Democratic groups, according to federal regulation.
Apple, Google and most other major internet players have adopted privacy policies that would appear to significantly constrain the ability of data management firms to obtain detailed household information, consumer spending and partisan leanings of smartphone users.
But it turns out that there are ways to get around the rules.
Serge Egelman, a research director at Berkeleyâ€™s International Computer Science Institute and a co-author of the paper â€œ50 Ways to Leak Your Data: An Exploration of Appsâ€™ Circumvention of the Android Permissions System,â€ replied to my email:  Most users are likely of the impression that apps will only collect the personal data that theyâ€™re asked about in the â€˜permissions dialoguesâ€™ that they encounter (i.e., pop-up notifications asking if itâ€™s O.K.
for an app to access certain data, such as location, address book contacts, photos, etc.).
These unsuspecting users were mistaken.
We discovered that there are â€œback channelsâ€ through which the same data is available without having to present the user with a permission dialogue.
What does this mean for politics?
We know that many of these entities are data brokers and analytics companies that are in the business of using this type of data to profile mobile device users, and then selling these profiles to various entities, including political campaigns.
The data  generally provides information about individual usersâ€™ day-to-day activities and preferences: Where they shop; What they do for fun; What other apps they use, for how long, and what they do in those apps; Where they live; Where they work; With whom they associate.
This data, he added, enables campaigns to list â€œindividual attendees at political rallies;â€ to identify â€œpolitical leanings based on online and offline preferences (where you live, work, shop, play, etc.
); and to segment â€œads based on inferred psychographic traits (i.e., exactly what Cambridge Analytica did, but instead of personalized political ads on Facebook, users get personalized ads in potentially all of their mobile apps).â€  Egelman noted that â€œfrom the userâ€™s perspective, thereâ€™s literally no way of preventing it from happening or even knowing when itâ€™s happening.â€ The expectation â€œthat app users should be able to figure this all out and manage it is absolutely ludicrous.â€  A pro-Democratic strategist who is helping coordinate the independent effort to defeat Trump â€” and who insisted on anonymity to protect his job â€” described what he believes is the current state of play in the role of digital technology in larger, overall strategy:  Thereâ€™s no question that as a technical matter, the Republicans and the Kochs are spending much more and have better data than Democrats/progressives.
But they also have a much more difficult product to sell: Trump.
If Marco Rubio were president in this thriving economy, he continued, â€œ2020 would not be a competitive election, and the Democrats might not have claimed the House in 2018.â€  â€œCrucially,â€ the strategist said,  Trump has two relevant advantages deriving from the asymmetry between the flow of Republican and Democratic information.
First, when Trump says something, Fox repeats it.
When a Democrat says something, The New York Times and the rest of the MSM knock it down if itâ€™s false or debatable.
In other words, a huge swath of Trump-supportive media does not perform fact-based journalism.
In addition, the Democratic strategist said,  Trump benefits enormously because of the Rightâ€™s aligned network of media properties (i.e., Sinclair), Facebook properties, YouTube influencers and bots/sock puppets.
This kind of amplification network barely exists for Democrats/progressives.
While studies show that â€œdigital ads have at most a slight persuasive effect,â€ he noted,  the real goal of paid advertising is for the content to become organic social media.
For example, a Trump ad saying that heâ€™s brought back manufacturing jobs would persuade almost no one.
But, when local news or your neighbor starts repeating that, it becomes more credible and persuasive.
Thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re after.
To sum up, their content is advantaged because it reaches their target audiences, without friction, from the media that audience trusts, and is quickly and reliably repeated by other voices they trust in their world.
Whatâ€™s the bottom line?
Finally, thereâ€™s the question of the size of the value of Trumpâ€™s data/digital advantage.
Big enough to enable him to win the popular vote?
Almost certainly not.
Big enough to win Wisconsin?
Frighteningly so.
Trump Wants Law and Order Front and Center By Thomas B. Edsall Jan. 8, 2020  Unexpectedly, the 2020 presidential campaign is drilling down on petty crime and homelessness.
Donald Trump and his Republican allies are reviving law-and-order themes similar to those used effectively by Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew in the late 1960s and early 1970s to demonize racial minorities.
To this end, Republicans seek to discredit liberalized law enforcement initiatives adopted by a new breed of Democratic prosecutors.
These Democratic district attorneys â€” in cities, counties and suburbs from Philadelphia, Orlando, Chicago and St. Louis to Contra Costa County, Calif., Suffolk County, Mass., and Durham County, N.C. â€” are pursuing policies intended to decriminalize vagrancy, and eliminate cash bail, and they are aggressively pursuing charges in cases of shootings by police officers.
They are playing a key role in a hotly politicized movement to curb mass incarceration and to roll back what has become known as â€œthe carceral state.â€  The decarceration movement is backed by a wide array of organizations tightly aligned with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party: the Real Justice PAC, Black Lives Matter, the Brennan Center for Justice, the ACLU, Justice Democrats, MoveOn.org and Brand New Congress.
Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center, and Adureh Onyekwere, a senior research and program associate there, along with Inimai Chettiar and Priya Raghavan, described the goals of the movement in a May 2019 essay, â€œEnding Mass Incarceration: Ideas from Todayâ€™s Leadersâ€: Mass incarceration is the civil rights crisis of our time.
The racial disparities pervasive in our justice system compound at every juncture: African Americans are more likely to be stopped by police, arrested, detained before trial, and given harsher sentences than whites.
How do we achieve change, the authors ask?
The solutions they envisage range broadly From eliminating prison for lower-level crimes to incentivizing states to decarcerate, from ending bail to abolishing private prisons, from reforming housing and employment laws to changing the public perception of the justice system and cultivating respect for all lives.
At the same time, as this movement has been gaining momentum, it has provided ammunition for a powerful counterattack from President Trump, his attorney general, William Barr, and other law-and-order Republicans.
The result is that the 2020 election is expanding the 50-year-old culture war into new territory as Democrats â€” often under pressure from younger voters â€” seek to extend broader rights to those who have been previously stigmatized or marginalized, now moving beyond protection for minorities, women and gays, to provide more freedom to criminal defendants, the homeless, the mentally ill and unknown numbers of men and women imprisoned through prosecutorial misconduct, judicial error or other forms of systemic failure.
Republicans, in turn, are betting that the Democratic presidential candidates have moved substantially farther to the left on issues of crime and punishment than the voting public.
Leading Democratic presidential candidates, for their part, are not shying away from the challenge, endorsing in whole or in part the decarceration and decriminalization agenda.
Even Joe Biden, one of the more moderate 2020 candidates, argued at the September Democratic presidential debate that â€œWe should be talking about rehabilitation.
Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crimeâ€ and that â€œNobody should be in jail for a drug problem.
We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons.â€  Once a strong supporter of the death penalty, Biden now calls for its elimination, noting on his website: Over 160 individuals whoâ€™ve been sentenced to death in this country since 1973 have later been exonerated.
Because we cannot ensure we get death penalty cases right every time, Biden will work to pass legislation to eliminate the death penalty at the federal level.
While many of the Democratic presidential candidates have effectively joined the decarceration movement, the same unity cannot be found among House and Senate Democrats.
At this level, the movement is one more source of conflict between the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wing and the many members of the House and Senate who must fight for re-election in more moderate districts and states, including those that cast majorities for Trump in 2016.
Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard, described the thinking underpinning progressive Democratic policies broadening the rights of the homeless.
In an email, Tribe wrote: The supposed â€œrightsâ€ of those who are upset or psychologically threatened by the homeless, the deinstitutionalized, or others similarly situated are what I would call second-order rights, rights that a polity cannot fairly treat as having as strong a claim to protection, as trumps that override utilitarian claims as is true of genuine rights.
Put another way, Tribe continued, my â€œrightâ€ not to be upset by your appearance or life choices cannot occupy the same plane as your right to live your life as you opt to, or are compelled to, live it if we are to have a viable social and legal system.
One neednâ€™t be a libertarian to recognize that there is a difference in kind between someoneâ€™s genuine right to be free of anotherâ€™s physical intrusion or displacement and someoneâ€™s ersatz right to be free of anotherâ€™s merely offending or upsetting behavior or circumstances.
In this view, according to Tribe, â€œrights of the first, or primary, sort can be universally recognized; rights of the second sort must be subordinated if social life is to be tolerable.â€  Trump, for his part, clearly rejects Tribeâ€™s distinction between first versus second order, or genuine versus ersatz, rights.
For Trump, the people who come into contact with the homeless have first order rights.
In a July 1, 2019, interview with Foxâ€™s Tucker Carlson, Trump declared: You canâ€™t have whatâ€™s happening â€” where police officers are getting sick just by walking the beat.
I mean, theyâ€™re getting actually very sick, where people are getting sick, where the people living there living in hell, too.
Trump went on: We cannot ruin our cities.
And you have people that work in those cities.
They work in office buildings and to get into the building, they have to walk through a scene that nobody would have believed possible three years ago.
And this is the liberal establishment.
This is what Iâ€™m fighting.
Republicans are responding to the initiatives of progressive prosecutors with a vengeance.
In a fiery speech on Aug. 12 at the Grand Lodge Fraternal Order of Policeâ€™s conference in New Orleans, Barr warned that progressive prosecutors in cities across the nation are â€œdemoralizing to law enforcement and dangerous to public safety.â€  This threat, Barr continued, comes from the emergence in some of our large cities of District Attorneys that style themselves as â€˜social justiceâ€™ reformers, who spend their time undercutting the police, letting criminals off the hook, and refusing to enforce the law.
These prosecutors, Barr declared, have been announcing their refusal to enforce broad swathes of the criminal law.
Most disturbing is that some are refusing to prosecute cases of resisting police.
Some are refusing to prosecute various theft cases or drug cases, even where the suspect is involved in distribution.
And when they do deign to charge a criminal suspect, they are frequently seeking sentences that are pathetically lenient.
So these cities are headed back to the days of revolving door justice.
The results will be predictable.
More crime; more victims.
Three days later, William M. McSwain, the Trump-appointed United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, called a news conference to explicitly attack the Philadelphia district attorney, Larry Krasner.
Krasner was elected in 2017 on a platform promising to End mass incarceration; Stop prosecuting insufficient and insignificant cases; Review past convictions, free the wrongfully convicted; Stop cash bail imprisonment; Treat addiction as a medical problem, not a crime.
To McSwain these policies are heretical: There is a new culture of disrespect for law enforcement in this city that is promoted and championed by District Attorney Larry Krasner â€” and I am fed up with it.
It started with chants at the DAâ€™s victory party â€” chants of â€œF*** the policeâ€ and â€œNo good cops in a racist system.â€  There are, McSwain argued, plenty of criminal laws in this city â€” but what we donâ€™t have is robust enforcement by the district attorney.
Instead, we have diversionary programs for gun offenses, the routine downgrading of charges for violent crime, and entire sections of the criminal code that are ignored.
Most recently, President Trump, at a rally on Dec. 10 in Hershey, Pa., told the crowd â€œYou have the worst district attorney,â€ referring to the Philadelphia D.A., roughly 95 miles east.
â€œIâ€™ve been hearing about this guy, he lets killers out almost immediately.
You better get yourself a new prosecutor.â€  Turning the decarceration movement into a 2020 campaign issue fits into Trumpâ€™s go-to strategy of inflaming divisive conflicts, especially those involving disputed rights â€” particularly those benefiting minorities â€” in order to activate racial resentment, to mobilize his core voters and to goad swing voters into lining up against the Democratic Party.
While Trumpâ€™s strategy was successful in 2016, it is by no means clear that this strategy will work as well in 2020.
A February 2019 paper, â€œEvaluating the Impacts of Eliminating Prosecutorial Requests for Cash Bail,â€ by AurÃ©lie Ouss, professor of criminology at the University of Pennsylvania, and Megan Stevenson, a law professor at George Mason, examined the consequences of Philadelphiaâ€™s â€œno-cash-bailâ€ policies.
Contrary to fears that the elimination of cash bail would â€œdecrease accountability and increase failure-to-appear in court,â€ the authors detected no change in failure-to-appear in court or in recidivism, suggesting that reductions in the use of monetary bail can be made without significant adverse consequences.
At the same time, however, the violent crime rate in Philadelphia has increased by 5 percent from 2018 to 2019, according to the cityâ€™s police department.
While homicide and rape both declined by 5 and 9 percent respectively, robbery without a gun increased 11 percent, aggravated assault with a gun by 13 percent and assault without a gun by 3 percent.
There is no evidence that the partial elimination of cash bail caused the increase in violent crime.
In fact, in 2018, the first full year when the policies were in effect, crime dropped 5 percent.
In some other cities that have elected to reduce the use of cash bail, crime has gone down.
In Boston, crime dropped 5 percent from 2018 to 2019, the first full year in office for Rachel Rollins, the Suffolk County district attorney.
Rollins pledged that she would not prosecute such crimes as larceny under $250, disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, receiving stolen propertyâ€ along with â€œbreaking and entering â€” where it is into a vacant property or where it is for the purpose of sleeping or seeking refuge from the cold and there is no actual damage to property breaking and entering, wanton or malicious destruction of property, drug possession with intent to distribute and a stand-alone resisting arrest charge, i.e.
cases where a person is charged with resisting arrest and that is the only charge.
The approach to prosecution adopted by Rollins and others directly contradicts the â€œbroken windowsâ€ policing strategy that was widely popular among both Democrats and Republicans in the 1990s.
The Economist described the premise behind broken windows law enforcement this way: â€œIn environments where disorderly behavior goes unchecked â€” where prostitutes visibly ply their trade or beggars accost passers-by â€” more serious street crime flourishes.â€  Over the past four years, many progressive Democrats have turned sharply against the aggressive policing that broken windows enforcement produced, arguing that it has contributed to excessive incarceration that results in the disproportionate imprisonment of African-Americans and other minorities.
At the presidential debate in September, virtually every candidate voiced strong opposition to mass incarceration and support for the release or sentence reduction of those convicted of nonviolent crime.
Many of the crimes progressive prosecutors are declining to press charges on are linked to homelessness, vagrancy, drug possession, disorderly conduct, breaking into vacant property, and so forth â€” which, from a strategic point of view, enables Trump and his allies to link homelessness with progressive Democratic law enforcement policies.
On this issue, one of Trumpâ€™s key allies is Tucker Carlson.
Every night this week, Carlson is devoting segments of his Fox News show to homelessness.
His show will reinforce the 2020 Republican election theme that Democrats are fostering endemic social disorder.
On Jan. 3, Carlson tweeted: â€œDrugs.
Homelessness.
Third world inequality.
San Franciscoâ€™s radical left wing government has turned their city into an American Dystopia.â€  This weekâ€™s series is the second time in less than a year that Carlson has devoted five straight nights to homelessness, with footage of men and women injecting themselves, evidence of public defecation, the vagrant mentally ill, and sidewalks in California lined for blocks with tents.
The Trump administration has been working for months to develop a new, hard-nosed federal policy on homelessness.
CityLab and other publications report that the administration is expected to fund local police efforts to remove public encampments and to put the homeless in federal shelters requiring strict adherence to rules of sobriety and non-disruptive behavior.
â€œThe White House is taking steps toward decisive new action on homelessness, bucking policies favored by advocates in favor of an aggressive approach that centers the role of law enforcement,â€ CityLab reported on Dec 17, 2019: Advocates say that they expect an executive order on homelessness to assign new resources to police departments to remove homeless encampments and even strip housing funds from cities that choose to tolerate these encampments.
The Trump campaign is gambling that Democrats are outside the mainstream of public opinion on these issues, while the leading Democratic candidates are convinced that enough of the electorate has become sufficiently skeptical of law-and-order strategies â€” and the accompanying racial undertones (and overtones) â€” to produce a Democratic victory on Nov. 3, 2020.
Over the past 50 years, Democratic strategies based on the presumption of increasing liberalism among voters at large have rarely succeeded.
Perhaps 2020 will be different.
Tucker Carlson Is Not Your New Best Friend By Frank Bruni Jan. 11, 2020  Suddenly youâ€™re digging him.
At least a little bit.
I know, Iâ€™ve seen the tweets, read the commentary, heard the chatter, detected the barely suppressed cheer: Hurrah for Tucker Carlson.
If only we had more brave, principled Republicans like him.
Right out of the gate, he protested President Trumpâ€™s decision to kill Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian military commander, noting that it didnâ€™t square with the presidentâ€™s determination not to get bogged down in the Middle East and warning of the possibility and horror of full-blown war.
Your pulse quickened.
You perked up.
He sounded that same alarm on his next show and the show after that.
Every night at 8 p.m., he worried about the bellicose itch of our leaders.
When all around him on Fox News were playing their usual roles (indeed, his usual role) as masseurs for the presidentâ€™s tender ego, he administered slaps, hard ones, the kind that leave angry red handprints.
Ouch â€” and donâ€™t stop.
You rejoiced.
Itâ€™s one thing when Democrats challenge what looks like a rush to war by a Republican president.
Itâ€™s another when typically fawning members of his own party do.
And while Carlson was hardly alone in his rebellion â€” three House Republicans voted with Democrats to check the presidentâ€™s war-waging authority and, over in the Senate, Mike Lee and Rand Paul raised a dissident ruckus â€” no one else had his ardor, his articulateness, his megaphone.
Carlson to the rescue!
Oh, please.
The fascination with him is itself fascinating, for many reasons.
Can you recall a modern president before Trump whose moods and movements could be reflected and predicted simply by watching one news organization and, for that matter, just a few of its offerings?
In lieu of a normally functioning White House communications department or a press secretary who holds actual press briefings (what a thought!
), we have â€œFox & Friendsâ€ in the morning and Carlsonâ€™s and Sean Hannityâ€™s shows in the evening.
They donâ€™t chronicle this presidency.
They shape it, not just in terms of the volume of their applause for Trump, who craves the loudest possible clapping, but in terms of actual interactions.
Carlson â€” like Hannity and another Fox fixture, Lou Dobbs â€” has in fact advised him behind the scenes.
Hence the rapt reaction to Carlsonâ€™s antiwar jeremiads.
They may well matter.
Also, those of us who regard Trump as a menace can be so eager â€” too eager â€” to welcome newcomers to our shores that we overlook the polluted seas they sailed to get there.
In a recent moment on the ABC talk show â€œThe Viewâ€ that was awkward at best, Joy Behar announced excitedly that the prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer had just disavowed Trump because of Iran.
Carlson, mind you, has not disavowed Trump.
In fact he performed semantic acrobatics to denounce Americaâ€™s military maneuvers against Iran without precisely blaming Trump.
Those slaps I mentioned landed more forcefully on the administration in general than on the man-child at its apex, who is, in Carlsonâ€™s tortured rendition, a gullible marionette, his strings pulled by inveterate, habitual warmongers.
If these profiteering elites would just let Trump be Trump and train his wrath on Mexicans instead of Iranians, a great presidency would get its groove back.
During his Tuesday show, Carlson performed political jujitsu and held two of the presidentâ€™s principal Democratic adversaries responsible for exacerbated tensions with Iran.
Referring to the Washington establishment and singling out Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, he said, â€œThese are people who have been basically advocating for a kind of war against Iran for an awfully long time.â€  â€œItâ€™s infuriating,â€ he added.
â€œItâ€™s because of Schumer and Pelosi and people like them that we got into Iraq in the first place.â€  Come again?
A Republican president, George W. Bush, urged and oversaw the invasion of Iraq, and while Schumer authorized it, Pelosi voted against it, as did many more Democrats than Republicans.
And Carlsonâ€™s portrait of Trump as puppet contradicts reporting from The Times and other news organizations that some Pentagon officials were stunned when the president ordered the strike against Suleimani, a measure more extreme than other options presented to him.
Carlson remains true to Carlson: selective with facts, slanted with truths and â€” this is the most important part â€” committed to his vision of America as a land imperiled by nefarious Democrats and the dark-skinned invaders they would open the gates to if not for sentries like him and Trump.
As Matt Gertz of Media Matters perceptively noted, Carlsonâ€™s antiwar stance â€œis not a break from his past support for Trump or his channeling of white nationalist tropes, but a direct a result of both.â€ Gertz explained that in the mind-set of Carlson and many of his fans on the far right, energy spent on missions in another hemisphere is energy not spent on our southern border.
Itâ€™s no accident that, in regard to the Middle East, he and Spencer are on the same page.
Following Suleimaniâ€™s death, Carlson asked his audience, â€œWhy are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping into another quagmire?â€  Carlson is defined not by a bold willingness to check Trumpâ€™s excesses or ugliest impulses but by his indulgence â€” no, his fervent encouragement â€” of those impulses as they pertain to racism and immigration.
On those fronts, Carlson himself grows ever uglier, as my colleague Farhad Manjoo and others have noted.
Itâ€™s why many sponsors have defected from Carlsonâ€™s show.
Carlson repeatedly uses variations of the word â€œinvasionâ€ to characterize migrants from Central America.
He insists that â€œwhite supremacyâ€ is a fiction, a hoax.
He has used language that buys into and promotes â€œreplacement theoryâ€ â€” a far-right fixation on the idea that declining birthrates among whites will cause a nonwhite takeover â€” and recently castigated immigrants for litter along the Potomac River.
Just last month he gave precious time on his show to an obscure Republican congressional candidate in North Carolina, Pete Dâ€™Abrosca, who has warned white Americans that theyâ€™re â€œbeing replaced by third world peasants.â€ Dâ€™Abrosca has also bragged of his support from the â€œgroyper army,â€ a far-right group with more than a whiff of anti-Semitism.
Is Carlson himself abetting hatred of Jews?
In a rare point of agreement, some Jews and white nationalists believe so, pointing to an on-air rant last month in which he bashed a Jewish billionaire, Paul Singer, by comparing him unfavorably with Henry Ford, who owned a newspaper that ran a lengthy series alleging a Jewish plot to dominate the world.
â€œThe Fox News host goes full anti-Semite,â€ wrote Tablet, a Jewish publication, while Mike Enoch, who rallied with the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Va., said on his podcast, â€œIf you didnâ€™t catch the German shepherd whistles where he praised Henry Ford and then went into a diatribe of a Jewish financier, you know, I donâ€™t know what universe youâ€™re existing in.â€  So thatâ€™s some of what Carlson was up to just before he turned his attention to Iran.
How warm and fuzzy are you feeling toward him now?
Black Britons Know Why Meghan Markle Wants Out By Afua Hirsch Jan. 9, 2020  The British press has succeeded in its apparent project of hounding Meghan,  Duchess of Sussex, out of Britain.
The part it perhaps didnâ€™t bargain for, however, is the loss of Prince Harry â€” a much loved royal and a key part of the familyâ€™s global brand â€” along with her.
In a statement released this week, the couple said they wanted to â€œcarve out a progressive new roleâ€ within the royal family and would â€œstep back as â€˜seniorâ€™ members, and work to become financially independent.â€  The British press reacted with surprise at the â€œshock move abroad,â€ described variously as â€œseismic,â€ â€œselfish,â€ â€œrogueâ€ and â€œan atrocious lapse of judgment.â€  If the media paid more attention to Britainâ€™s communities of color, perhaps it would find the announcement far less surprising.
With a new prime minister whose track record includes overtly racist statements, some of which would make even Donald Trump blush, a Brexit project linked to native nationalism and a desire to rid Britain of large numbers of immigrants, and an ever thickening loom of imperial nostalgia, many of us are also thinking about moving.
From the very first headline about her being â€œ(almost) straight outta Comptonâ€ and having â€œexoticâ€ DNA, the racist treatment of Meghan has been impossible to ignore.
Princess Michael of Kent wore an overtly racist brooch in the duchessâ€™s company.
A BBC host compared the coupleâ€™s newborn baby to a chimpanzee.
Then there was the sublimely ludicrous suggestion that Meghanâ€™s avocado consumption is responsible for mass murder, while her charity cookbook was portrayed as somehow helping terrorists.
Those who claim frequent attacks against the duchess have nothing to do with her race have a hard time explaining these attempts to link her with particularly racialized forms of crime â€” terrorism and gang activity â€” as well as the fact that she has been most venomously attacked for acts that attracted praise when other royals did them.
Her decision to guest-edit British Vogue, for example, was roundly condemned by large parts of the British media, in stark contrast to Prince Charlesâ€™s two-time guest editorship of Country Life magazine, Prince Harryâ€™s of a BBC program and Kate Middletonâ€™s at Huffington Post, all of which were quietly praised at the time.
Her treatment has proved what many of us have always known: No matter how beautiful you are, whom you marry, what palaces you occupy, charities you support, how faithful you are, how much money you accumulate or what good deeds you perform, in this society racism will still follow you.
In Britainâ€™s rigid class society, there is still a deep correlation between privilege and race.
The relatively few people of color â€” and even fewer if you count only those who have African heritage â€” who rise to prominence and prosperity in Britain are often told we should be â€œgratefulâ€ or told to leave if we donâ€™t like it here.
The legacy of Britainâ€™s history of empire â€” a global construct based on a doctrine of white supremacy â€” its pioneering role in the slave trade and ideologies of racism that enabled it, and policies of recruiting people from the Caribbean and Africa for low-paid work and then discriminating against them in education and housing, is with us today: The scandal surrounding the wrongful deportation of black British people in recent years is still reverberating.
Meghanâ€™s decision to join the family that is the symbolic heart of the establishment responsible for this troubled history was perplexing to many black British people, as we wondered whether she fully appreciated the institution she had entered.
Both she and Harry appear to have gained crystal clear vision as to their reality.
Itâ€™s no wonder the couple want to leave and â€” as the coded statement that they want to raise their son, Archie, â€œwith the space to focus on the next chapterâ€ seems to suggest â€” protect him from the bile to which theyâ€™ve been exposed.
The British press, having attacked the couple continuously, now reacts with shock at this move.
But the clues have been there for some time for anyone willing to read them.
There was the decision not to give Archie a title from birth â€” something that is expected among royal children of this rank but which Meghan and Harry appear to have chosen to avoid.
Then there were the rumors last spring that they might relocate to a country in southern Africa.
In recent months, the couple have begun bypassing official royal channels and communicating with the press directly â€” most notably when the duchess said in a television documentary that she found adjusting to royal life â€œhard,â€ and Harry revealed that the tragic experience of the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, made him want to â€œprotectâ€ his wife and family.
All were signs that the couple would not abide by royal business as usual, to the extent that even announcing this decision to step down from their roles as senior royals appears to have taken Buckingham Palace by surprise.
I am not at all surprised.
This was the bitter shadow of their sunny May 2018 wedding.
How many of us suspected â€” hoping but doubting we were wrong â€” that what would really initiate Meghan into her new role as a Briton with African heritage would be her experience of British racism.
And ironically, by taking matters into their own hands, Harry and Meghanâ€™s act of leaving â€” two fingers up at the racism of the British establishment â€” might be the most meaningful act of royal leadership Iâ€™m ever likely to see.
Two Deaths and My Life By Roger Cohen Jan. 10, 2020  Samuel Beckett, when asked one beautiful spring morning whether such a day did not make him glad to be alive, responded, â€œI wouldnâ€™t go as far as that.â€ Life is a predicament, death the elephant at the horizon that looms larger as the years pass.
Still, life is what we have.
To give less than everything to it is dereliction.
In the end its wonder is unimaginable without the presence of death.
As the dew dispels, the mist dissolves, and the sap rises on a morning such as the one that did not quite win over Beckett, the force of life is unmistakable.
That is what put us here in the first place.
Great souls resemble the elements in their immensity.
They absorb everything â€” pain, injustice, insult, folly â€” and give back decency and kindness.
They are not born of a piece.
They come into being through unflinching confrontation with lifeâ€™s spears.
They reach quiet.
Discipline is the backbone of graciousness.
Stoicism is the other face of wounds.
In the most beautiful smile, painful knowledge hovers.
Midwinter is not what prompted these reflections, although when a freezing wind whips off the East River all thoughts turn to refuge.
No, the death in quick succession of two friends was the catalyst.
They were older than me.
But they were not old enough and not so distant in age that their memento mori feel less than urgent.
Sonny Mehta, who died last month at the age of 77, would caress the books he loved.
For them he lived.
He guided Alfred A. Knopf through more than three decades of rapid change.
He was a complete publisher, eclectic in his tastes, ferocious in his will, guided by a mission to bring the finest books to Knopf and publish them only once editing had honed them to irreproachable form.
Yet he wanted to be remembered above all as a reader.
I knew Sonny for three decades.
He published my last two books.
His civility never wavered.
The twinkle in his eye never faded.
His friendship was constant.
Whisky and a cigarette and the meandering conversation that went with them were more his thing than the treadmill.
He was a beautiful man.
How so?
In his gentleness that contained wisdom, in his diffidence that contained enthusiasm, in his discretion that contained curiosity.
You had to listen carefully, for he spoke softly, to the clues he offered.
His long marriage to his wife, Gita, brought to my mind, in its respectfulness and vitality, Rilkeâ€™s phrase about love as protecting the solitude of the other.
A child of India, brown-skinned in what was when he started the white preserve of British publishing, once asked if he was perhaps seeking a job in the stockroom, Mehta never stooped to unkindness.
His writers knew they had come home.
He commanded the unswerving loyalty of the likes of Michael Ondaatje, Kazuo Ishiguro, Germaine Greer and Julian Barnes.
â€œI feel that my heart has been ripped out,â€ Jon Segal, his longtime colleague at Knopf, told me.
When Mehtaâ€™s father, a diplomat, died in Vienna, Mehta found in his desk a folder with every article ever published about him.
The pride of his father, who had never complimented his son, was evident.
Remote fathers: vast subject.
Hearing this story, I understood more of my friendâ€™s elegant stoicism.
Earlier in December, Ward Just, a journalist who turned to fiction, a great Washington Post correspondent in Vietnam who became a great novelist, died at the age of 84.
Like Mehta, he was a lover of Scotch.
I had not seen much of Just since we became friends in Berlin 20 years ago, but his death hit me hard.
I recalled him saying to me back then: â€œI was useless for journalism after Vietnam.
I knew I was not going to do any better work.â€  Truth, he decided, must be pursued elsewhere.
â€œMany of the things that make you a good journalist have to be discarded to make you a good writer,â€ he said.
â€œIn a novel, every fact is a rock thrown in the hull, and the boat sinks a bit.â€  Just probed the delusions of people and nations, and the damage they suffer.
His prose was understated.
In â€œA Dangerous Friend,â€ one character observes, â€œI have always believed that a mountainous ego resulted from an absence of conscience.â€ And that was before His Neediness seized the Oval Office.
As with Mehta, Justâ€™s prodding was subtle, his smile contained sorrows, his wisdom was hard-earned, his constant humor wry.
Wounded by a grenade blast in 1966, winched to safety by a chopper, he later wrote, as quoted in his Washington Post obituary: â€œWhen you got there, you said instinctively, I made it.
And over and over again, Jesus Christ.â€  I can hear my friend saying that, stress on the Christ.
Life hangs by a thread.
Pay attention to its ephemeral gifts.
Of Truman Schockley, dead at 19 in Vietnam, Just wrote in 1967:  â€œSmoking a Lucky Strike and staring off into the mountains, Schockley died with a sniperâ€™s bullet through the heart and stopped breathing before the cigarette stopped burning.â€  Now thereâ€™s a perfect sentence that might even have persuaded Beckett.
Spring passes.
Truth distilled does not.
Warren and Klobuchar Teach the Boys a Lesson By Frank Bruni Jan. 15, 2020  Would a female Democratic nominee have a harder time beating Donald Trump than a male one?
I canâ€™t tell you, because I donâ€™t have a crystal ball and because itâ€™s a stupid question, its answer dependent on which female candidate youâ€™re talking about, on how she runs her campaign, on the twists and turns of the national conversation between now and November.
But I can tell you this: Either of the two women among the six candidates on the stage in Des Moines on Tuesday night would give Trump a serious run for his money.
Both have earned the right to take him on.
Both would be formidable presidents.
And both made clear, with commanding performances, how absurd it is that this country hasnâ€™t yet shattered the highest glass ceiling of all.
Iâ€™m focusing on Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar because during the most electric stretch of this seventh debate of the Democratic primary, the focus was indeed on them â€” or, rather, on the idea that their party couldnâ€™t risk nominating one of them at a juncture when getting rid of a Republican incumbent has seldom, if ever, been so important.
You know the back story.
According to media reports over recent days, Warren and Bernie Sanders met 13 months ago to discuss their nascent presidential campaigns and he told her he didnâ€™t believe a woman could win the 2020 election.
Sanders denies saying that.
He denied it again on Tuesday night, and Warren declined to get into a back-and-forth about that conversation.
What she did instead was more effective â€” and certainly more stirring: She drew a contrast between the two women and the four men who had made the cut for this debate, which was the final one before the Iowa caucuses and had the fewest candidates so far.
That contrast was perfect, and got better still when Klobuchar chimed in, because what the two women said brilliantly cast them not as trailblazers who had something extra to prove, not as outsiders who had finagled a way in, not as underdogs urging voters to take some extraordinary leap of faith, not as high-minded gambles.
They turned the stubborn, sexist notion that their presence and presidential ambitions were exotic on its head, citing yardsticks by which they were demonstrably superior to their male rivals.
â€œI think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at peopleâ€™s winning record,â€ Warren, a second-term senator from Massachusetts, said.
â€œLook at the men on this stage.
Collectively, they have lost 10 elections.â€ She didnâ€™t name the men or the elections, but Joe Biden is the veteran of two previous, miserably unsuccessful campaigns for the presidency.
Pete Buttigieg lost bids to become the treasurer of Indiana and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
In contrast, Warren noted, â€œThe only people on this stage who have won every single election that theyâ€™ve been in are the women â€” Amy and me.
And the only person who has beaten an incumbent Republican any time in the past 30 years is me.â€  Klobuchar, a third-term senator from Minnesota, said you donâ€™t need to be male to win just as you donâ€™t need other qualities pronounced necessary or optimal by some unnamed, amorphous committee of pronouncers.
â€œYou donâ€™t have to be the skinniest person in the room,â€ she said.
â€œYou donâ€™t have to be the loudest person.
You have to be competent.â€  â€œAnd when you look at what I have done,â€ she added, â€œI have won every race, every place, every time.
I have won in the reddest of districts.
I have won in the suburban areas, in the rural areas.â€ That, she added, was why she had â€œthe most endorsements of current Iowa legislators and former Iowa legislators in this race.â€  I donâ€™t mean to romanticize Warren and Klobuchar.
Warrenâ€™s boast about vanquishing a Republican incumbent?
That incumbent was Scott Brown, whose victory in a special election in deep blue Massachusetts was considered something of a freak occurrence to begin with.
And when Klobuchar began to tick off the names of women recently elected to high posts, she suddenly froze, unable to remember who the governor of Kansas was, though sheâ€™d just said, â€œIâ€™m very proud to know her.â€ (Her name is Laura Kelly.)
Iâ€™m also not saying that Warren or Klobuchar would be the partyâ€™s best bet.
I donâ€™t know who would be.
Iâ€™m just saying that on a night when the viability of women aiming for the White House went from subtext to text, these two women found words â€” not just in addressing that issue but also in talking about prescription-drug prices, climate change, nuclear weapons and more â€” that exposed the bigotry and shamefulness of doubts about female candidates.
Otherwise the seventh debate was sleepily like many of the first six: Biden seemed to be campaigning for a third Barack Obama term, and his sentences were less straight lines than knots.
They didnâ€™t build toward a conclusion so much as sag until they finally gave out.
Warren said â€œcorruptionâ€ every chance she got.
Sanders called for revolution and correctly emphasized that many trade and foreign-policy positions that other Democrats came around to he embraced from the start.
Buttigieg pivoted from the question at hand to a practiced soliloquy that almost always had something to do with turning the page and a new generation.
Tom Steyer insisted that no one cared about the environment as much as he did.
And Klobuchar talked about so many different pieces of legislation with her name on them that you had this image of her racing around the Capitol with an outstretched pen, stopping all aides who passed by and scrawling her signature on any paper they were carrying.
One new wrinkle was Warrenâ€™s clear and proud positioning of herself to Sandersâ€™s right on trade and on health care.
She was making the case for herself as a progressive who would favor incremental fixes if those were the only available improvements and who could be a unifier; she suggested that Sanders lacked that potential.
Buttigieg, meanwhile, was more determined than ever to mention and reach out to voters of color, from whom he enjoys little support.
But what most distinguished the debate was the way in which gender came to the fore.
There was a memorable moment when Sanders sought to correct Warren on her 30-year claim, noting that heâ€™d defeated a Republican in 1990, and she did some quick, out-loud arithmetic to determine that 1990 was, well, 30 years ago!
Mansplaining met mathematics.
Warren also said this: â€œSince Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have outperformed men candidates in competitive races.
And in 2018, we took back the House; we took back statehouses, because of women candidates and women voters.â€  â€œBack in the 1960s,â€ she added, â€œpeople asked, â€˜Could a Catholic win?â€™ Back in 2008, people asked if an African-American could win.
In both times the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate and we changed America.
Thatâ€™s who we are.â€  It was a self-serving edit of history, sure, and it put the most positive gloss possible on the nationâ€™s character.
But that didnâ€™t make it any less important.
Or any less inspiring.
We Canâ€™t Afford Trump as Our Commander in Chief By Frank Bruni Jan. 7, 2020  We choose our presidents in happy times and sad, amid bull and bear markets, when weâ€™re trying to conserve what is and when weâ€™re itching to discover what might be.
We should always choose them as if weâ€™re on the brink of war, because itâ€™s impossible to predict when weâ€™ll find ourselves there, in petrified need of a strong, stable leader we can trust.
Donald Trump was chosen in a fit of long-building and largely warranted cynicism, as a gamble and protest.
He hadnâ€™t demonstrated any particular strength, only that he could perform a peculiar burlesque of it.
He showed zilch in the way of honor, but had a genius for stoking doubts that it still existed in politics at all.
His supporters thrilled to a pledge of disruption, not a promise of safe harbor.
And here we are, with an inexperienced, impulsive and perpetually aggrieved commander in chief precisely when we canâ€™t afford one.
I hope I have him wrong.
I do.
I hope that some of his worst colors are an act, that some of his rashest outbursts are a strategy, that instinct can be as useful as erudition and that in ordering the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, he has persuaded Iran to rethink rather than redouble its aggression.
But there are reasons to be worried, even terrified, and theyâ€™re rooted in his untraditional and sometimes irrational approach to the presidency â€” and in the wages of that.
Iâ€™m scared because all presidents are only as good as the counsel they seek and the counselors who provide it, and Trump has burned through so many top advisers and so much good will that he operates with a hollowed-out staff of half-baked experience.
His second (and current) defense secretary, Mark Esper, lacks the seasoning and stature of his first, Jim Mattis, who resigned 13 months ago when Trump rejected his pleas and vowed to pull American troops out of Syria.
That, at least, was the specific prompt for Mattisâ€™s departure.
But Mattis also â€œfound the president to be of limited cognitive ability and of generally dubious character,â€ wrote Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, in a profile of Mattis last fall.
Limited cognition?
Dubious character?
Those may not matter when youâ€™re choosing the gilt for a golf resort or skyscraper.
They do when youâ€™re deciding whether to put American lives on the line.
Trump is on his fourth national security adviser, Robert Oâ€™Brien, whose rÃ©sumÃ© is thin for the job.
And throughout the Trump administration, there are relevant posts unfilled or occupied by officials never confirmed by the Senate.
Weâ€™re estranged from some of our most important allies, who are exhausted by Trumpâ€™s moods, offended by his mockery of them and chilled by his ignorance.
They have concluded that if he is America, America is no longer trustworthy.
As Greg Miller of The Washington Post recently observed, the president â€œhas disparaged U.S. intelligence agencies, disrupted relationships with European partners and diluted the power of the bully pulpit with thousands of falsehoods.â€  All of that is coming home to roost.
Itâ€™s impossible not to hear his justifications for Suleimaniâ€™s killing through the filter of his past exaggerations and lies.
It will be equally difficult to have faith in the information that he doles out going forward.
And itâ€™s hard to make sense of this.
Erratic in so many other ways, Trump was fairly consistent in opposing American military entanglements in the Middle East, to the point of scornfully bashing Republicans who got us into Iraq and ignoring recommendations for reprisals against Iran before last week.
But in targeting Suleimani, he embraced a course that his predecessors in the Oval Office rejected as too extreme.
According to The Timesâ€™s reporting, Pentagon officials were stunned.
Is Trumpâ€™s spectacular turnabout a function of fresh developments or a spasm of ego?
Weâ€™re always yoked to a presidentâ€™s psyche â€” to George W. Bushâ€™s itch for separation from his father, to Barack Obamaâ€™s investment in his own unflappability.
Trumpâ€™s self-soothing pantomimes of potency could strangle us.
And what of his recklessly provocative tweets?
Theyâ€™re one thing when heâ€™s baiting Democrats, quite another when heâ€™s thumbing his nose at international law.
On Twitter he threatened to bomb important cultural sites in Iran and later explained to reporters aboard Air Force One that if it and other countries were going to engage in terrorism and torture, hell, why should we be any better?
Here, Mr. President, is the reason: because we aspire to values that are actually worth fighting for.
And the day we take our cues from the likes of the Taliban and the Islamic State is the day we should just junk the Statue of Liberty and retire the national anthem.
Reshaping Americaâ€™s image in 280-character yowls and uppercase yelps, Trump told Iran to be prepared for military attacks of â€œa disproportionate manner.â€  Please, God, let Richard Nixonâ€™s â€œmadman theoryâ€ of international relations â€” which held that an aura of recklessness might cow adversaries â€” have merit.
Otherwise, thereâ€™s no telling where this mad man might drag us.
â€œDonald Trump has not made a single public statement since ordering last Thursdayâ€™s operation that has not been either unhelpful or counterproductive,â€ Noah Rothman, the associate editor of Commentary, wrote on Monday.
Rothman is conservative, does not routinely bash Trump and defended Suleimaniâ€™s killing itself.
But in his essay, titled â€œA Dangerous Man in Perilous Times,â€ he noted that â€œthe best anyone can say about Trumpâ€™s spasmodic conduct is that it wonâ€™t matter.â€  â€œSerious moments demand sober and rational minds at the helm, and the presidentâ€™s behavior so far does not inspire confidence,â€ Rothman added.
No, it makes you tremble.
We Hate Data Collection.
That Doesnâ€™t Mean We Can Stop It.
By Farhad Manjoo Nov. 15, 2019  Weâ€™re being watched.
We know weâ€™re being watched, and we donâ€™t think the watchers have our best interests at heart.
They try to mollify us, arguing that weâ€™re being watched for our own good and that in fact weâ€™re the ones in charge of the scale and scope of all the watching, but deep down most of us are confused and suspicious about this sudden state of affairs.
Why are they watching us so closely?
What will they do with all they learn about us?
Is there any hope of stopping them?
And does it even matter that we do not want to be watched â€” or is it of no consequence, because they know weâ€™re trapped, and so do we?
The above may sound like the ravings of a wretch imprisoned in the Panopticon, but according to a survey of more than 4,000 people conducted this summer by the Pew Research Center, it is the widespread sensibility of the day.
According to the survey, Americans in 2019 feel adrift and powerless about living under the glare of digital surveillance.
Two-thirds of Americans believe that surveillance is an inevitable consequence of modern existence â€” it is not possible to go through daily life, they say, without companies and the government collecting data about them.
More than 70 percent believe that most or all of what they do online is being tracked, and nearly that many believe the same is true of what they do offline.
And more than 80 percent feel like they have very little or no control over the data being collected about them.
In some ways the numbers are unsurprising; of course people who are being watched all the time feel that theyâ€™re being watched all the time.
Yet the survey also suggests a major failing on the part of corporations and the government to mitigate our concerns about the trade-offs weâ€™re making for digital conveniences.
In the past few years, Google, Facebook and other companies that collect and keep gigantic troves of data about us have stepped up their efforts to give us control over that data.
Their primary argument is that users, not the companies, are in charge of the whole game â€” we can affect what data is collected about us and how itâ€™s used.
That message doesnâ€™t seem to be getting through.
Large majorities of Americans feel as we have little or no control over our search and purchase and browsing histories; that our texts and social media wandering are easily monitored; and that even our physical location may be up for grabs.
It gets worse.
Not only do we feel we have no control over our data, but weâ€™re also sure there will be few consequences for misuse.
Most Americans say they donâ€™t trust companies to own up to mistakes in the handling of our data, or to suffer any serious punishment when things go wrong.
Most of us say the companiesâ€™ own privacy policies are meaningless.
Not that this is a paranoid view.
If you consider recent history â€” say, the fact that Equifax was allowed to stay in business after its gargantuan 2017 breach in which it failed at its one job, collecting and maintaining Americansâ€™ financial data â€” it stands to reason that punishments for wrongdoing will be light.
In July, Facebook was fined $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission for its role in the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal â€” a fine that set a record, but was of so little consequence to Facebookâ€™s business that its stock price actually rose after the punishment was announced.
The Pew survey shows Americans are eager for more power over our data.
Three-quarters of respondents said there should be more regulation of what companies can do with our data; the view was shared across the political spectrum.
And Americans are wary of the fundamental trade-off weâ€™re making for technology.
Data-hungry corporations insist that weâ€™re benefiting from the surveillance state â€” and that our very acquiescence to the collection is a signal of our contentment.
In fact, the vast majority of Americans say that the potential risks of data collection by companies and the government outweigh the benefits.
But where does all this leave us?
Ordinarily a finding of widespread discontentment should spark a sense of optimism â€” if people hate the status quo so much and are begging for a new way forward, wonâ€™t the market or the government step in and give us something better?
But there is another,more pessimistic way to read this survey.
The tech companies still enjoy enormous financial success, and have seen little impact from increasing scrutiny on their businesses.
This suggests none of it matters.
We hate the way things are, but weâ€™ve traded away our power to stop it, and our worries wonâ€™t change anything.
The prison is terrible.
We all know it.
Enjoy your stay.
We Made the Coronavirus Epidemic By David Quammen Jan. 28, 2020  The latest scary new virus that has captured the worldâ€™s horrified attention, caused a lockdown of 56 million people in China, disrupted travel plans around the globe and sparked a run on medical masks from Wuhan, Hubei Province, to Bryan, Texas, is known provisionally as â€œnCoV-2019.â€ Itâ€™s a clunky moniker for a lurid threat.
The name, picked by the team of Chinese scientists who isolated and identified the virus, is short for â€œnovel coronavirus of 2019.â€ It reflects the fact that the virus was first recognized to have infected humans late last year â€” in a seafood and live-animal market in Wuhan â€” and that it belongs to the coronavirus family, a notorious group.
The SARS epidemic of 2002-3, which infected 8,098 people worldwide, killing 774 of them, was caused by a coronavirus, and so was the MERS outbreak that began on the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 and still lingers (2,494 people infected and 858 deaths as of November).
Despite the new virusâ€™s name, though, and as the people who christened it well know, nCoV-2019 isnâ€™t as novel as you might think.
Something very much like it was found several years ago in a cave in Yunnan, a province roughly a thousand miles southwest of Wuhan, by a team of perspicacious researchers, who noted its existence with concern.
The fast spread of nCoV-2019 â€” more than 4,500 confirmed cases, including at least 106 deaths, as of Tuesday morning, and the figures will have risen by the time you read this â€” is startling but not unforeseeable.
That the virus emerged from a nonhuman animal, probably a bat, and possibly after passing through another creature, may seem spooky, yet it is utterly unsurprising to scientists who study these things.
One such scientist is Zheng-Li Shi, of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a senior author of the draft paper (not yet peer reviewed and so far available only in preprint) that gave nCoV-2019 its identity and name.
It was Ms. Shi and her collaborators who, back in 2005, showed that the SARS pathogen was a bat virus that had spilled over into people.
Ms. Shi and colleagues have been tracing coronaviruses in bats since then, warning that some of them are uniquely suited to cause human pandemics.
In a 2017 paper, they set out how, after nearly five years of collecting fecal samples from bats in the Yunnan cave, they had found coronaviruses in multiple individuals of four different species of bats, including one called the intermediate horseshoe bat, because of the half-oval flap of skin protruding like a saucer around its nostrils.
The genome of that virus, Ms. Shi and her colleagues have now announced, is 96 percent identical to the Wuhan virus that has recently been found in humans.
And those two constitute a pair distinct from all other known coronaviruses, including the one that causes SARS.
In this sense, nCoV-2019 is novel â€” and possibly even more dangerous to humans than the other coronaviruses.
I say â€œpossiblyâ€ because so far, not only do we not know how dangerous it is, we canâ€™t know.
Outbreaks of new viral diseases are like the steel balls in a pinball machine: You can slap your flippers at them, rock the machine on its legs and bonk the balls to the jittery rings, but where they end up dropping depends on 11 levels of chance as well as on anything you do.
This is true with coronaviruses in particular: They mutate often while they replicate, and can evolve as quickly as a nightmare ghoul.
Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance, a private research organization based in New York that focuses on the connections between human and wildlife health, is one of Ms. Shiâ€™s longtime partners.
â€œWeâ€™ve been raising the flag on these viruses for 15 years,â€ he told me on Friday with calm frustration.
â€œEver since SARS.â€ He was a co-author of the 2005 bats-and-SARS study, and again of the 2017 paper about the multiple SARS-like coronaviruses in the Yunnan cave.
Mr. Daszak told me that, during that second study, the field team took blood samples from a couple of thousand Yunnanese people, about 400 of whom lived near the cave.
Roughly 3 percent of them carried antibodies against SARS-related coronaviruses.
â€œWe donâ€™t know if they got sick.
We donâ€™t know if they were exposed as children or adults,â€ Mr. Daszak said.
â€œBut what it tells you is that these viruses are making the jump, repeatedly, from bats to humans.â€ In other words, this Wuhan emergency is no novel event.
Itâ€™s part of a sequence of related contingencies that stretches back into the past and will stretch forward into the future, as long as current circumstances persist.
So when youâ€™re done worrying about this outbreak, worry about the next one.
Or do something about the current circumstances.
Current circumstances include a perilous trade in wildlife for food, with supply chains stretching through Asia, Africa and to a lesser extent, the United States and elsewhere.
That trade has now been outlawed in China, on a temporary basis; but it was outlawed also during SARS, then allowed to resume â€” with bats, civets, porcupines, turtles, bamboo rats, many kinds of birds and other animals piled together in markets such as the one in Wuhan.
Current circumstances also include 7.6 billion hungry humans: some of them impoverished and desperate for protein; some affluent and wasteful and empowered to travel every which way by airplane.
These factors are unprecedented on planet Earth: We know from the fossil record, by absence of evidence, that no large-bodied animal has ever been nearly so abundant as humans are now, let alone so effective at arrogating resources.
And one consequence of that abundance, that power, and the consequent ecological disturbances is increasing viral exchanges â€” first from animal to human, then from human to human, sometimes on a pandemic scale.
We invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants â€” and within those creatures, so many unknown viruses.
We cut the trees; we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets.
We disrupt ecosystems, and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts.
When that happens, they need a new host.
Often, we are it.
The list of such viruses emerging into humans sounds like a grim drumbeat: Machupo, Bolivia, 1961; Marburg, Germany, 1967; Ebola, Zaire and Sudan, 1976; H.I.V., recognized in New York and California, 1981; a form of Hanta (now known as Sin Nombre), southwestern United States, 1993; Hendra, Australia, 1994; bird flu, Hong Kong, 1997; Nipah, Malaysia, 1998; West Nile, New York, 1999; SARS, China, 2002-3; MERS, Saudi Arabia, 2012; Ebola again, West Africa, 2014.
And thatâ€™s just a selection.
Now we have nCoV-2019, the latest thump on the drum.
Current circumstances also include bureaucrats who lie and conceal bad news, and elected officials who brag to the crowd about cutting forests to create jobs in the timber industry and agriculture or about cutting budgets for public health and research.
The distance from Wuhan or the Amazon to Paris, Toronto or Washington is short for some viruses, measured in hours, given how well they can ride within airplane passengers.
And if you think funding pandemic preparedness is expensive, wait until you see the final cost of nCoV-2019.
Fortunately, current circumstances also include brilliant, dedicated scientists and outbreak-response medical people â€” such as many at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, EcoHealth Alliance, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C.D.C.
), the Chinese C.D.C.
and numerous other institutions.
These are the people who go into bat caves, swamps and high-security containment laboratories, often risking their lives, to bring out bat feces and blood and other precious evidence to study genomic sequences and answer the key questions.
As the number of nCoV-2019 cases has increased, and the death toll along with it, one metric, the case fatality rate, has remained rather steady so far: at about or below 3 percent.
As of Tuesday, less than three out of 100 confirmed cases had died.
Thatâ€™s relatively good luck â€” worse than for most strains of influenza, better than for SARS.
This good luck may not last.
Nobody knows where the pinball will go.
Four days from today, the number of cases may be in the tens of thousands.
Six months from today, Wuhan pneumonia may be receding into memory.
Or not.
We are faced with two mortal challenges, in the short term and the long term.
Short term: We must do everything we can, with intelligence, calm and a full commitment of resources, to contain and extinguish this nCoV-2019 outbreak before it becomes, as it could, a devastating global pandemic.
Long term: We must remember, when the dust settles, that nCoV-2019 was not a novel event or a misfortune that befell us.
It was â€” it is â€” part of a pattern of choices that we humans are making.
We Really Must Stop Starting Wars By Farhad Manjoo Jan. 9, 2020  Let us not go again to war.
Let us not go to war because we cannot afford to â€œwinâ€ another war.
There would be no winning this war.
There is only losing, at a cost that staggers every dimension on all sides â€” in lives, in money, and in the squandered opportunity to do anything better with our collective time and resources on this already beset planet.
Iâ€™m speaking here of war with Iran, our current precipice.
But I issue the warning more generally, too.
Bookmark this page and pull it up as prophylaxis anytime the drums of war begin rattling anew: War isnâ€™t just tragic.
It is increasingly dumb and pointless, too.
War is becoming an outdated means of human conflict resolution.
Technology is turning armed conflict into an endeavor increasingly dominated by what war scholars call â€œasymmetric warfareâ€ â€” meaning that weaker powers like Iran can now marshal so much strength that they are no longer very weak, exacting a mighty cost of victory even to the worldâ€™s pre-eminent global superpower.
Then there is climate change, which has ratcheted up the opportunity cost of every conflict; anytime we are fighting each other, we are absconding in the larger and more important fight for the habitability of the planet.
You may debate whether any particular historical war worked out well for its agitators.
But there should be no debate that many of Americaâ€™s recent wars have ended in misery for all.
Our politicians talk of war as a last resort, but that is only to keep up appearances, because the truth is too terrible to admit: that our ever-more-expensive war machine (a cost of nearly $740 billion in 2020) can buy us little peace.
Rather than a last resort, war now offers no resort.
War can no longer be defended as the thing to do after everything else has failed.
War must instead be seen as failure itself.
I had thought the futility of war might be grasped by most American politicians by now.
One of Donald Trumpâ€™s rare bright spots as a candidate was his departure from the post-9/11 Bush-Cheney doctrine that doubled down on heedless American military interventionism.
In his oft-stated aversion to â€œendless war,â€ Trumpâ€™s sentiment matched the publicâ€™s â€” a Pew poll this summer showed that most Americans, including most military veterans, now believe that our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have not been worth fighting.
Trump seemed to be heeding the publicâ€™s caution back in the summer when he abruptly called off a strike against Iran in retaliation for its shooting down an American surveillance drone.
But in killing Iranâ€™s most important military leader, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Trump opened the door to war.
Now Iran is retaliating, and a cycle of escalation looks possible â€” even if, for now, Trump is backing away from further conflict.
Itâ€™s beginning to feel a lot like 2003 again, with some of the same pundits and politicians who were in favor of a war with Iraq now repeating similar talking points about Iran.
While noting that heâ€™d like to avoid war, Trump himself has suggested that war with Iran would be a cakewalk: â€œIt wouldnâ€™t last very long, I can tell you that,â€ the president told Fox Business in June.
Donâ€™t fall for it.
Itâ€™s plain dishonesty: How could anyone who has lived through the quagmire of Iraq and Afghanistan think war with Iran will be anything but long and brutal?
In those conflicts, Americaâ€™s overwhelming military might stumbled on local culture, geography, ethnic and religious rivalries, and most of all the determination of an entrenched, committed foe that could melt in and out of the local population.
As Voxâ€™s Alex Ward points out, Iran has almost three times as many people as Iraq did when we invaded in 2003.
It also has treacherous geography, and it controls a great many proxy forces across the Middle East and even in likely sleeper cells in Europe and Latin America.
Iran also possesses a sophisticated cyberwar operation â€” it is believed to be behind recent hacks into American banks and other targets and to have spread disinformation and propaganda on social networks around the world.
The United States would overwhelm Iran in a conventional head-on war, but like China and Russia, Iran has adopted a deep capacity to mount â€œhybrid warâ€ â€” conflict that involves both conventional and unconventional means of war.
(For example, Iran could expand its operations on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, dealing a costly rise in global energy prices.)
As Ward concludes: â€œA U.S.-Iran war would be a bloody hell during and after the fighting.â€  This gets to the immense folly at the heart of our military might.
Though the United States spends more on the military than the next nine countries combined, we have not been able to purchase much peace through strength.
Thatâ€™s because our strength is clearly of a type, and our years in Iraq and Afghanistan have made plain our vulnerabilities.
Among other shortcomings, our military is still buying mostly big, old defense technologies (like aircraft carriers and bombers) from the military-industrial complex, even if many of these technologies face obsolescence under a future of artificial intelligence, unmanned battlefield robots and other cyberweapons.
Our countryâ€™s efforts at adopting artificial intelligence technology in the military might not be enough to counter our rivals, including Russia and China.
The upshot is this: The United States holds military supremacy over the worldâ€™s waters and the airspace, but our control is limited and contestable.
The last two decades have made clear that even for America, war is never simple.
We should fear it.
We should avoid it.
And we ought to look for more fruitful things to do with our money and our lives, like making life on earth more livable, not less.
What Does It Mean to Have a Serious Drinking Problem?
By Nancy Wartik Jan. 31, 2020  One day in the fall of 2018, I woke up feeling wrecked.
The night before Iâ€™d had beers with colleagues and wound up braying loudly to one of them about something sheâ€™d confided and what I thought she should do.
â€œI wish Iâ€™d never told you this,â€ she finally blurted, and I knew Iâ€™d betrayed a trust.
A few nights before, Iâ€™d been more inept.
A group of us had held a memorial for a friend.
At a gathering later, Iâ€™d had a martini with prosecco chasers, then picked a senseless quarrel with our hostess, a close friend as bereaved as I was.
Now I sat there, head pounding, stomach roiling.
It was another in a string of mornings when Iâ€™d woken wanting to smother myself with a pillow.
Booze: It didnâ€™t take much for me to feel the effects.
Alcohol could make nights glittery and fun, make me love all humankind.
It could also, and unpredictably, rouse demons that turned me into a wifely shrew, sparked bruising arguments, unleashed embarrassing faux pas.
This morning, a new thought struck, penetrating to the bone.
â€œI canâ€™t do it anymore.
I quit.â€  Although Iâ€™d grappled for decades with my relationship to alcohol, I didnâ€™t consider myself an alcoholic.
In online quizzes asking how many drinks I typically had per day, I could fairly accurately answer â€œtwoâ€ (very generous drinks).
On the World Health Organizationâ€™s AUDIT quiz, which tests for drinking problems, I scored eight of 40 points, making me a â€œmediumâ€ drinker with a â€œriskyâ€ pattern.
But medium didnâ€™t sound too bad and the website said I could alter my drinking â€œwithout too much difficulty.â€  Plus, I had the vaunted female triumvirate: husband, kid, respectable job.
Friends, when they werenâ€™t mad at me.
O.K., sometimes I overdid it.
But it was easy to imagine myself as your average fun-loving Parisian oenophile.
And yet.
I was in my late teens when I discovered what alcohol could do: quash my inhibitions; kindle false intimacies; provoke brilliant revelations that I soon forgot.
Alcohol made me the outgoing person my unconfident self wanted to be, let me talk to people I normally wouldnâ€™t have.
Yes, occasionally I awoke to see a head on the adjoining pillow and felt a bolt of regret.
â€œDamn!
Why did this guy seem cute last night?â€  But Iâ€™d call a friend: â€œGuess what I did this time?â€ Iâ€™d ask, turning discomfort into a hilarious anecdote.
Or a friend would inform me of my revelry: â€œNancy, the bartender threw you out.
You couldnâ€™t stay on your stool.â€  Alcohol was also medication.
I drank to quiet angst or because I was lonesome.
I drank, it took years to realize, because I had clinical depression.
Eventually I treated the depression but kept drinking.
Alcohol was my stress reducer, my reality fighter, the conferrer of artificial joys.
Life changed in my 40s.
I married, and with my husband, adopted our beloved daughter, now 17.
Working from home, I made dinner, drinking wine with a neighbor mom.
My morning-after headaches were worsening, though.
Nights, rather than reading or chatting with my husband, Iâ€™d crash.
I feared my drinking was destroying brain cells.
Iâ€™d written about how alcohol is harder on women than men and that worried me, too.
Some years ago, to prove I had control, I cut down to five nights a week.
It was tough.
How could I not drink after a rough day?
I couldnâ€™t manage two consecutive sober nights.
Achieving my two sober nights was always an exercise in military-level strategizing.
But every Sunday, I felt virtuous.
An actual alcoholic couldnâ€™t skip any nights, I thought.
But I could.
What does it mean to have a serious drinking problem?
The answer is surprisingly vague.
â€œAlcoholismâ€ isnâ€™t an actual diagnosis.
In 1980, the American Psychiatric Associationâ€™s authoritative Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders established two different classifications: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence.
In 2013, the D.S.M.
combined the categories to create â€œalcohol use disorder,â€ a spectrum ranging from mild to severe, based not on how much someone drinks but on how many of 11 behavioral or psychological symptoms a person has.
Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has its own standards, focused more on quantity of alcoholic consumption.
Seven drinks per week or fewer is considered safe for women, 14 or fewer for men.
But guidelines fluctuate internationally, according to a Stanford University study from 2016.
In Canada or France, you can drink more weekly and be considered â€œlow risk.â€  Moreover, a recent study in The Lancet concluded alcohol is so tough on health that thereâ€™s no safe level.
In short, if you wonder whether you drink too much, sometimes itâ€™s best to trust your gut.
I donâ€™t know exactly what happened that fall morning as I sat in bed, achy and humiliated.
As viscerally as Iâ€™ve known anything, I knew I was in trouble.
So what if I didnâ€™t swig a bottle of Scotch daily?
Iâ€™d hit â€œmedium drinkerâ€ rock bottom and it was enough.
Despite the website saying I could change my drinking â€œwithout too much difficulty,â€ quitting booze is one of the hardest things Iâ€™ve ever done.
I pined for it: At restaurants, Iâ€™d gaze at ruby goblets as if at a divine elixir.
After workouts Iâ€™d crave a beer.
And what was the point of socializing sober?
Eventually, I had to try.
Guzzling nonalcoholic beer â€” before I wisely switched to seltzer â€” while chatting with people savoring complex pinot noirs was initially daunting.
But astonishingly, my non-intoxicated brain still found what they said funny, touching or interesting.
I didnâ€™t join A.A., though I donâ€™t rule it out.
I sought support from my husband, daughter and friends â€” those Iâ€™d offended, those surprised I even had a problem.
I devoured othersâ€™ stories, watching movies about alcoholics, reading memoirs, lurking in sub-Reddits for people struggling to quit.
But what really kept me on the path was the remarkable difference between the drinking and not drinking me.
I hadnâ€™t grasped the degree to which a sense of shame had insidiously undergirded my life.
Now it was gone, replaced by an unaccustomed pride.
The longer I abstained, the better I felt, in ways that spilled into marriage, work, parenting, friendships.
Recently, someone unaware Iâ€™d quit told me I looked years younger.
Iâ€™m more patient.
My headaches are infrequent, my energy up.
Those results fit with a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, among the first focused on moderate drinkersâ€™ mental health.
Researchers studying cohorts of people in Hong Kong and the United States found even â€œsafeâ€ drinkers, women in particular, showed improved well-being if they stopped.
Today, I can label myself.
I had moderate alcohol use disorder, a â€œchronic relapsing brain diseaseâ€ marked by loss of control over alcohol.
The National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse says 6.2 percent of American adults, more than 15 million people, are on the alcohol use disorder spectrum.
(Other research puts the numbers higher.)
Iâ€™d guess many, like me, drink modestly enough that they donâ€™t believe they have a problem.
I feel lucky I quit before anything worse happened.
Sobriety can still be a challenge.
If all goes according to plan, Iâ€™ll never again experience the soft scrim that drops between me and reality, as wine drains from my glass.
It seems sad, until I remember that three times since quitting, Iâ€™ve tried a celebratory drink.
Most recently, in Peru, I had one of the countryâ€™s famous pisco sours.
It gave me a mild buzz and a hangover.
I havenâ€™t had a drop since.
These days, I awaken clearheaded.
Iâ€™m closer than ever to being the mother, wife, relative and friend I want to be.
It feels good.
Really good.
I get up the next morning.
I do it again.
What if It Were Obama on Trial?
By Nicholas Kristof Jan. 25, 2020  What if it were President Barack Obama who was the subject of the Senate impeachment trial?
How would we feel then?
Cass Sunstein, a professor at Harvard Law School, suggests a question along those lines in his book â€œImpeachment: A Citizenâ€™s Guide.â€ Itâ€™s one of several thought experiments that I suggest in order to step back from the hurly-burly in the Senate and interrogate our own principles and motivations.
The first approach, as Sunstein puts it, is this:  â€œSuppose that a president engages in certain actions that seem to you very, very bad.
Suppose that you are tempted to think that he should be impeached.
You should immediately ask yourself: Would I think the same thing if I loved the presidentâ€™s policies, and thought that he was otherwise doing a splendid job?â€  Alternatively, if you oppose impeachment and removal, Sunstein suggests you ask yourself: â€œWould I think the same thing if I abhorred the presidentâ€™s policies, and thought that he was otherwise doing a horrific job?â€  In practical terms, this amounts to: What if it were Obama who had been caught in this Ukraine scandal?
My guess is that if it were Obama, Republicans would be demanding witnesses (as they did in the 1999 trial of Bill Clinton).
Given how aggressively Republican members of Congress pursued the Benghazi events â€” multiple investigations, eventually finding no evidence of wrongdoing by either Obama or then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton â€” Iâ€™m confident that the G.O.P.
would be insisting that Obama be removed, with frequent chants of â€œlock him up.â€  Yet I suspect that many Democrats would also switch sides, finding it easier to excuse misconduct by someone they admired â€” and seeing it as more important in that situation to preserve executive privilege and leave it to voters to decide the matter in the fall.
Thatâ€™s why we owe it to ourselves, as a matter of intellectual honesty, to think through how we would react if it were the other guy on trial.
(Progressives may be scoffing that this exercise is unrealistic: Obama was meticulous in avoiding scandal and ethical conflicts.
He checked with the Justice Department before accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, and for him a â€œscandalâ€ was something like wearing a tan suit.
The Ukraine mess would have been out of character for Obama, while it is entirely in character for Trump.
But Republicans will see this differently.)
The second thought experiment comes from another distinguished lawyer, Neal Katyal, in his new book â€œImpeach: The Case Against Donald Trump.â€  â€œImagine if it had worked,â€ Katyal suggests.
â€œImagine if our president had leveraged his role as commander in chief to convince a foreign power to open an investigation into his political opponent.
Imagine if the presidentâ€™s rival lost the primary because news broke that he was under investigation.
Imagine if that meant the president faced a weaker candidate in November 2020 â€” and won re-election as a result.â€  The foreign country could then blackmail our president by threatening to expose the corruption, gaining leverage over our foreign policy.
Meanwhile, the president might abuse presidential power in other ways in the belief that impunity was complete.
If all this eventually became public, and truth does have a way of trickling out, this would have devastating consequences for the legitimacy of American elections.
This thought experiment perhaps isnâ€™t so far-fetched.
We know now that Trumpâ€™s pressure on Ukraine caused alarm in the White House and the intelligence community, with National Security Adviser John Bolton likening it to a â€œdrug deal.â€ Yet for all that uproar, it almost didnâ€™t become public.
It was only because of a whistle-blower that the information began to emerge, and the military aid to Ukraine was released only after the White House became aware of the whistle-blower and was being pressured by Congress.
In short, Trumpâ€™s plan almost succeeded â€” and in any case, he will get away with it in the sense that he is sure to be acquitted by the Senate.
When Republicans suggest that Trump did nothing wrong, what message does that impunity send to Trump and to future presidents?
The third thought experiment is simple: What if Trump werenâ€™t president, but was like almost any other person in America?
What if he were a high school vice principal who ensured that a police detectiveâ€™s son would be accepted in advanced placement classes â€” and then added, â€œIâ€™d like you to do us a favor, though.â€ The favor would be an investigation of the vice principalâ€™s ex-wife before their upcoming child custody hearing, in hopes of tilting the outcome in his favor.
In that situation, the vice principal would be fired.
We all recognize that no school official or other person in a government bureaucracy should use public power for private benefit.
So a last query: Shouldnâ€™t we have as high a standard for the president of the United States as for a school vice principal?
What if Trump Gave Alaska to Putin?
By Nicholas Kristof Jan. 22, 2020  Letâ€™s not dismiss the Senate impeachment trial as a â€œkangaroo court.â€ Thatâ€™s an insult to kangaroos, who lately have been suffering enough.
President Trump and Senate Republican leaders seem to be planning a rushed, sham trial with no witnesses and limited evidence.
This reminds me of a trial I once monitored of a Chinese journalist in Beijing: The proceedings were held in a majestic court building with high ceilings, plush courtrooms, crisp microphones and attentive security officers, all overseen by solemn judges â€” everything a justice system might want, except justice.
Whatâ€™s at stake in this trial is the basic idea that Americaâ€™s leader is accountable for misconduct.
Without that concept, we may have a grand Senate chamber and eloquent speeches, but our democracy rings hollow.
Without that principle of equality before the law, our grand Senate under Mitch McConnell simply becomes an American analogue of Chinaâ€™s rubber-stamp National Peopleâ€™s Congress.
McConnellâ€™s grim determination to see no evidence and hear no witnesses is particularly hypocritical because in 1999, during the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, he did favor allowing witnesses.
â€œItâ€™s certainly not unusual to have a witness in an impeachment trial,â€ he said then.
Lindsey Graham, a member of the House and an impeachment manager at the time, was even more blunt.
â€œIf thereâ€™s any doubt, call witnesses,â€ he urged.
â€œIn every trial that there has ever been in the Senate regarding impeachment, witnesses were called,â€ Graham noted then.
By the count of House Democrats, the average number of witnesses is now 33 for each of the past impeachment trials.
Knowing that John Bolton as national security adviser referred to the Ukraine mess as a â€œdrug deal,â€ why would senators not want to clarify what he meant?
Why risk covering up a cover-up?
There are less strained arguments that McConnell and others could make against removing Trump from office.
They could say that the presidentâ€™s conduct, while improper, did not rise to the level requiring removal.
Instead, Trump and his defenders are pursuing a line of defense that would create an imperial, unchecked presidency, because itâ€™s not clear what would ever merit impeachment and removal by their standards.
Trumpâ€™s team even suggests that â€œabuse of powerâ€ itself cannot be grounds for impeachment, calling it the â€œHouse Democratsâ€™ newly invented â€˜abuse of powerâ€™ theory.â€  Newly invented?
Abuse of power was central to the discussions of impeachment at the Constitutional Convention.
Alexander Hamilton said that impeachment was the remedy for â€œthe abuse or violation of some public trust.â€ It was also the basis for articles of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee against both Clinton and Richard Nixon (the full House rejected that article against Clinton, and Nixon resigned before a full House vote).
Frank O.
Bowman III, a constitutional law scholar who is cited in the presidentâ€™s legal brief, called that same brief â€œa well-crafted piece of sophistry.â€  Trump and his supporters simply make assertions without regard to reality.
This is an echo in the impeachment domain of the 16,241 false or misleading statements Trump made in his first three years in office, by the count of The Washington Post.
For example, Trumpâ€™s backers insist that impeachment and conviction require a violation of a particular criminal statute, even though most scholars agree that that is not the case.
Indeed, one early impeachment was of a judge who presided while drunk, which was not a violation of criminal law.
Trumpâ€™s lawyers argue that removal from office would amount to â€œnullifying an election and subverting the will of the American people.â€ Under that reasoning, despite the Constitution, a president could never be removed â€” and in that case, a president is untouchable.
We all recognize that a president has the right to pardon criminals, but suppose he pardoned hackers in exchange for â€œinvestigatingâ€ the Bidens?
Or what if Trump announced that he would pardon every Republican bank robber?
Or suppose Trump fawned over Vladimir Putin to the point of returning Alaska to Russia?
As it happens, Alaska isnâ€™t my example, but that of Alan Dershowitz, the presidentâ€™s lawyer.
â€œAssume Putin decides to â€˜retakeâ€™ Alaska, the way he â€˜retookâ€™ Crimea,â€ Dershowitz wrote in a 2018 book.
â€œAssume further that a president allows him to do it, because he believed that Russia has a legitimate claim to â€˜itsâ€™ original territory.â€ Even that would not merit impeachment and removal by Dershowitzâ€™s standards.
Note to Alaska senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan: Your thoughts, comrades?
Do we really think that there should be no checks on a rogue president as he handed Alaska over to Putin â€” or Florida to Spain, while weâ€™re at it â€” or even as he pardoned streams of Republican bank robbers?
Must we tolerate an out-of control ruler who engages, in the words of the Declaration of Independence, in â€œa long train of abuses and usurpationsâ€?
Thatâ€™s the kind of system that we rebelled against in 1776, no?
What Will You Do When the Culture War Comes for You?
By Charlie Warzel Jan. 29, 2020  The culture war will come for us all.
On Sunday, it came for a Washington Post reporter, Felicia Sonmez.
Nine people were killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, Calif., that morning, including the basketball legend Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna.
The news rocketed around social media, where mourners shared their heartbreak at the news.
As is common with major breaking news, some reports were inaccurate or false, layering anxiety on top of grief.
Into the mix, Ms. Sonmez tweeted the link to a 2016 article from The Daily Beast about a young womanâ€™s accusation that Mr. Bryant had raped her in Colorado.
Criminal charges against him were dropped in 2004 and a civil suit was settled out of court.
The tweet highlighted the fact that Mr. Bryantâ€™s legacy is fraught and complicated, and attracted the attention of fans as well as trolls who bombarded her inbox with abuse and posted her home address online.
Ms. Sonmez then posted a selection of the threats she received, without obscuring the names of the people who had sent her hate mail.
She slept in a hotel on Sunday night, fearing for her safety at home, she said.
We donâ€™t know all the details, but it seems that The Postâ€™s managing and executive editors were not pleased.
They chastised her over email and placed her on administrative leave while the organization reviewed whether she had violated the companyâ€™s social media guidelines.
Their reasoning on Monday: â€œThe tweets displayed poor judgment that undermined the work of her colleagues.â€ The Post reversed her suspension on Tuesday, roughly 36 hours after the initial tweets, stating that senior managers had concluded that Ms. Sonmezâ€™s tweets didnâ€™t violate company policy.
This, of course, was obvious to almost everyone but The Postâ€™s higher-ups.
It was impossible to imagine how posting a link to a story by a different publication on Twitter could undermine the work of colleagues.
Just as it was impossible to imagine which colleagues would have felt undermined (more than 300 of Ms. Sonmezâ€™s colleagues expressed solidarity with her in a letter from The Postâ€™s union to management).
There remain glaring questions.
Did the executive editor, Marty Baron, inquire about Ms. Sonmezâ€™s safety when he emailed her to criticize her tweets?
What, beyond a reflex for online civility, led The Post to determine the reporter was â€œhurting this institutionâ€ by discussing a part of Mr. Bryantâ€™s legacy that appeared in The Postâ€™s own news pages?
Why, after years of watching journalists, women and vulnerable individuals being trolled and abused by viral outrage online, are newsrooms still falling for the same Gamergate-style tactics?
The Postâ€™s official statement (it doesnâ€™t quite rise to the level of an apology), which included the caveat â€œwe consistently urge restraintâ€ for reporters online, doesnâ€™t begin to answer these questions.
The incident also raises headier questions, including: In the world of online journalism, what specifically do writers owe to their publications via their social media presence?
Surely, thereâ€™s a bare minimum if theyâ€™re collecting a paycheck.
Journalists obviously shouldnâ€™t undermine their colleagues with cheap shots or reckless speculation as to othersâ€™ work.
They should stay professional.
After that, things get murky.
Twitter is a Gordian knot of news and opinion that canâ€™t be untangled.
Inside publications, news and opinion bleed together; opinion writers report while reporters opine via news analysis.
Partisan commentary, once a third rail for objective reporters, is omnipresent on Twitter.
In the past, news organizations â€” and the people who work for them â€” would never have called the president a racist.
Some now do so explicitly.
Newsrooms and even the platforms have struggled with finding a new standard in the Trump era of disinformation; meanwhile, journalists are expected to sort it out in real time, while on the job.
And to get it right or face consequences.
Journalists who build followings online, in part by being incisive, combative, funny and omnipresent on Twitter, are often hired because of that exposure â€” because theyâ€™re a known quantity.
At a larger organization, though, those same attributes may quickly be seen as a liability.
Publications hire diverse outspoken writers and then get anxious when these writers start tweeting about politics.
Some outlets ask staffers who donâ€™t cover incendiary beats like politics to refrain from commenting on political goings-on.
But what happens when politics touches everything?
For those whoâ€™ve made a name being outspoken, suddenly saying nothing is a statement in itself.
For newsroom leaders the questions get tough, fast.
Few if any outlets seem to want to draw exact lines.
And so they become blurred.
Thereâ€™s also a double standard.
While few publications would say it, itâ€™s all but required for young journalists to jump into the culture war online.
Itâ€™s a way to find stories.
And in a volatile industry it gets you noticed.
Being â€œpart of the discourseâ€ each day means being marketable.
It helps writers, but it also bolsters publications, helping promote big stories and creating all kinds of dystopian forms of content like â€œmicroscoops,â€ or breaking news too small to merit its own article but enough to tout to competitors on Twitter.
This exposure is a drug for journalists.
The real-time sparring and feedback is seductive, and the endorphin boosts of constant mentions is addictive.
But itâ€™s also exposure in the truest sense: great visibility and great vulnerability blended seamlessly together.
Though an argument could be made that all the time-wasting, in-jokes and gaffes from idle reporters and editors on Twitter subtly undermine the rigorous parts of the work, newsrooms benefit greatly from the constant exposure of their journalists.
Reporters use Twitter to poke and prod sources.
Writers sometimes enhance their stories with long tweet threads that explain the reporting process.
And reporters build trust with audiences by including or signaling to their audience perspectives in their online analysis (Ms. Sonmez, who has come forward with details of her own sexual assault, told her colleague Erik Wemple that her tweets were, in part, to make survivors like herself who follow her feel seen).
When important news breaks, newsrooms claim credit when their reporters break it first on Twitter.
Which is why The Postâ€™s statement, especially its urging of restraint, is so fraught.
The same editors who want restraint from reporters online during a celebrity death would most likely also be furious if their Capitol Hill reporters were slow in live-tweeting a hearing or impeachment proceeding and fell behind the competition.
Restraint is a virtue in journalism, no doubt, but so are tenacity and transparency.
The message is contradictory: Broadcast everything, but exercise restraint.
Twitter isnâ€™t real life, but tweets can and will get you fired or suspended.
But these qualities have been in conflict and competition for long before Twitter and newsrooms understood a journalist's exposure during breaking news and had their backs accordingly.
Evidence suggests thatâ€™s not always the case in the face of a cascade of online outrage.
Thatâ€™s less a change in the industry than it is a failure of newsroom leaders to understand the information war it sends its journalists out to fight in each day.
While the internetâ€™s culture war dynamics are fraught, theyâ€™re not all that hard to understand.
They come in the form of intimidation and threats toward journalists and angry campaigns toward advertisers and executives.
Some of the responses are posturing and some are real, but all are engineered for maximum virality and outrage.
Yes, sometimes journalists make mistakes.
Sometimes work will harm the institution or undermine co-workers, but newsroom leaders ought to be trained to distinguish trolls from good-faith criticism.
Itâ€™s a weird moment that newsrooms arenâ€™t talking about enough.
Just as social media platforms allow celebrities, politicians and influencers to circumvent traditional press gatekeeping, the same thing has happened to journalismâ€™s own practitioners.
Despite all the social media guidelines, thereâ€™s an unanswered question: Who do those followers really belong to?
Perhaps itâ€™s most accurate to say theyâ€™re an asset and a liability for both parties.
Everyoneâ€™s exposed.
But thereâ€™s an asymmetry to that exposure.
The culture war will come for us all, institutions and individuals alike.
One group can weather the storm, the other needs protection.
Newsrooms need to get smart, prepare and protect their foot soldiers.
Itâ€™s the least they can do.
â€˜BoJack Horsemanâ€™ Ended With a Necessary Reckoning By Charles Dunst Feb. 1, 2020  This essay contains spoilers for the final season of â€œBoJack Horseman.â€  â€œI havenâ€™t done anything.
Since I got out of rehab, I have been on my best behavior,â€ proclaims BoJack Horseman (voiced by Will Arnett), the eponymous protagonist of the animated Netflix show.
In the second half of the sixth and final season, BoJack, a washed-up 1990s sitcom star and anthropomorphic horse, has found out reporters are planning to publish a damning exposÃ© of his pre-rehab behavior.
â€œThey canâ€™t get me on old [expletive],â€ he pleads.
â€œIâ€™m a different person now.â€  But they do â€œget him.â€ After BoJack gives a Prince Andrew-like interview, heâ€™s ostracized and falls off the wagon, almost drunkenly drowning to death in the pool of his former home.
Heâ€™s convicted and sentenced to 14 months in prison for breaking and entering, although, he admits, â€œit was kind of for everythingâ€ â€” including seducing and almost sleeping with an ex-girlfriendâ€™s 17-year-old daughter and providing a former co-star with the heroin on which she fatally overdoses.
Male antihero TV characters like BoJack â€” the Don Drapers and Walter Whites who dominated the late 2000s and early 2010s â€” are usually designed to be empathetic.
Weâ€™re supposed to root for them despite their wrongdoings, and cheer when they ride off into the proverbial sunset as some karmic justice restores the brokenness theyâ€™ve left behind.
Since it began, â€œBoJack Horsemanâ€ has offered an alternative, forcing viewers to repeatedly see the damage its destructive protagonist inflicts, while complicating any empathy they might feel for him.
This unique approach arrived at its logical conclusion with the final installment of episodes released Friday, punishing BoJack while also laying out a path for his redemption.
If this remains a rare outcome on TV, it is even rarer in real life â€” and itâ€™s likely to resonate with viewers wrestling with what a transgressorâ€™s path to atonement might look like.
In crucial ways, BoJack bears resemblance to Jon Hammâ€™s Don Draper on â€œMad Menâ€ â€” both characters treat women horribly, using their professional power to get what they want without any serious self-reflection.
Yet unlike Don, BoJack eventually tries to better himself, address his drug addiction and repair the relationships he has broken.
At first, there seems to be hope for a neat ending for BoJack.
But that would have betrayed the showâ€™s underlying message that actions have consequences â€” and that the acknowledgment of this fact is central to oneâ€™s personal penance and evolution.
When a bowl or teapot falls and shatters, most people might throw it away, considering the object broken, ruined and without value.
The Japanese art of â€œkintsugiâ€ takes a radically different approach, using precious metal to bring the broken piece back together.
â€œBoJack Horsemanâ€ does something similar.
Take, for example, BoJackâ€™s confidant and former biographer, Diane Nguyen (Alison Brie).
Though thriving in her personal life, sheâ€™s struggling to write her promised collection of essays.
As she tries to focus, sheâ€™s interrupted by a surreal black-and-white mÃ©lange of key contributors to her emotional wreckage, including her father and BoJack.
A figment of her ex-husband, Mr. Peanutbutter (Paul F. Tomkins), appears in her mental chaos, offering tidbits of insight.
â€œCracks in an object are part of its history,â€ he says.
BoJack is also trying to piece himself back together.
After years of blaming his misdeeds on childhood trauma, he at last accepts responsibility for his behavior.
He emerges sober, thinking himself to be a new man, and mostly escapes professional punishment.
The movie he filmed right before entering prison has positive buzz.
The industry has forgotten BoJackâ€™s indiscretions, allowing him to walk entertainmentâ€™s dollar-paved road to rebirth.
â€œPeople have short memories,â€ says Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris), his agent and friend.
â€œItâ€™s the best and worst thing about people.â€  But a stint in rehab cannot erase the hurt heâ€™s caused the people in his life, just as similar periods out of the spotlight have not repaired the damage inflicted by real-life men who resurface in attempted comebacks.
Princess Carolyn declines to continue representing BoJack.
Hollyhock (Aparna Nancherla), his half sister, sends him a letter, the contents of which are never revealed to the viewer but which clearly marks her permanent exit from his life.
And Diane, whom BoJack has unfairly imagined to be his savior, wishes him well but implies their friendship has reached its end.
This bittersweet ending shows how within the last decade, writers and audiences have come to think differently about so-called â€œdifficult men.â€  Many people admired Don Draper â€” whom Jon Hamm himself called â€œa pretty dismal, despicable guyâ€ â€” despite seven seasons of narcissism, callous womanizing and a layered, platonic relationship with his one-time secretary Peggy Olson that often borders on the emotionally manipulative and abusive.
By the showâ€™s end, Don appears to remain on good terms with some of those he wronged, and is set to look after his children in the eventual absence of his dying ex-wife, Betty.
The series ends with him, ostensibly at peace, dreaming up the 1971 landmark Coca-Cola ad, â€œIâ€™d Like to Buy the World a Coke.â€  Viewers also rooted for Walter White on â€œBreaking Bad,â€ despite his deceitful and exploitative actions toward others, most notably Jesse Pinkman, his partner in crime, and Skyler White, his wife.
Skyler (Anna Gunn) was the only character who truly challenged Walterâ€™s behavior: Ms. Gunn herself received hate mail as a result.
The backlash was so strong that the actress penned a New York Times Op-Ed in 2013, observing that â€œmale characters donâ€™t seem to inspire this kind of public venting and vitriol,â€ which is instead reserved for TV wives like Skyler and Betty Draper on â€œMad Men."
Weâ€™re primed to extend empathy to the reckless antihero, rather than the characters representing the moral considerations that probably should hold them in check.
In its final episode, â€œBreaking Badâ€ valorizes Walter, a man who once coldly watched a woman die of an overdose without doing anything to save her, among many other horrific deeds.
He gets to go out on his own terms after magnificently mowing down a conglomerate of neo-Nazis, perhaps the only characters who outrank him in insidiousness.
â€œBoJack Horsemanâ€ is uniquely out of step here.
Its creator, Raphael Bob-Waksberg, doesnâ€™t want to give his protagonist such a satisfying ending.
Mr. Bob-Waksberg has said he based Season 5 of the show on the actor Mel Gibson, whose recorded racist rants failed to end his career.
And while the showrunner said he found himself â€œunwilling to forgiveâ€ the actor, he admitted to believing â€œin the power of forgiveness, generally.â€ This ambivalence speaks directly to the tone of the final season of â€œBoJack.â€  As a viewer, it would have felt preposterous for BoJack to be readily accepted back into the fold by the people who cared about him the most.
Itâ€™s fitting that the show forces him to reckon with his past in a way characters like Don Draper and Walter White never did.
The seriesâ€™ arc matches the publicâ€™s growing concerns about how to measure and take part in accountability across all walks of life â€” the #MeToo abusers and manipulators, yes, but also those who may have, for instance, said or done racist or homophobic things in their past.
By the end, BoJack comes to understand that, rather than disappear or drag him down, his past wrongs linger like precious â€œkintsugiâ€ cracks in his reformed self, serving as indelible reminders of where brokenness once was â€” and to illuminate who he is now as a whole.
â€œLifeâ€™s a [expletive] and then you die,â€ BoJack tells Diane in the final scene.
They are sitting on a maroon-shingled roof, having what they both recognize is likely to be their last interaction with one another.
But she disagrees.
Instead, she urges him to see the cracks of his past as fortification for the future, offering a correction he seems to accept.
â€œLifeâ€™s a [expletive],â€ she says, â€œand you keep living.â€ Where the Frauds Are All Legal By Elisabeth Rosenthal Dec. 7, 2019  Much of what we accept as legal in medical billing would be regarded as fraud in any other sector.
I have been circling around this conclusion for this past five years, as Iâ€™ve listened to patientsâ€™ stories while covering health care as a journalist and author.
Now, after a summer of firsthand experience â€” my husband was in a bike crash in July â€” itâ€™s time to call out this fact head-on.
Many of the Democratic candidates are talking about practical fixes for our high-priced health care system, and some legislated or regulated solutions to the maddening world of medical billing would be welcome.
My husband, Andrej, flew over his bicycleâ€™s handlebars when he hit a pothole at high speed on a Sunday ride in Washington.
He was unconscious and lying on the pavement when I caught up with him minutes later.
The result: six broken ribs, a collapsed lung, a broken finger, a broken collarbone and a broken shoulder blade.
The treatment he got via paramedics and in the emergency room and intensive care unit were great.
The troubles began, as I knew they would, when the bills started arriving.
I will not even complain here about some of the crazy high charges: $182 for a basic blood test, $9,289 for two days in a room in intensive care, $20 for a pill that costs pennies at a pharmacy.
We have great insurance, which negotiates these rates down.
And at least Andrej got and benefited from those services.
What Iâ€™m talking about here were the bills for things that simply didnâ€™t happen, or only kind-of, sort-of happened, or were mislabeled as things they were not, or were so nebulously defined that I couldnâ€™t figure out what we might be paying for.
To be clear, many of the charges that I would call fraudulent â€” maybe all of them â€” are technically legal (thanks sometimes to lobbying by providers), but that doesnâ€™t make them right.
And no one would accept them if they appeared on bills delivered by a contractor, or a lawyer or an auto mechanic.
There were so many of these charges that I came up with categories to keep track of them:  1.
Medical Swag In the trauma bay, someone slapped a hard brace around Andrejâ€™s neck until scans confirmed that he had not suffered a grievous spinal injury.
It was removed within an hour.
The medical equipment company that provided that piece of plastic billed $319.
Our insurer paid $215 (90 percent of its discounted rate of $239).
We were billed $24, our â€œpatient responsibility.â€  Companies are permitted by insurers to bill for â€œdurable medical equipment,â€ stuff you receive for home use when youâ€™re in the hospital or doctorsâ€™ office.
That yields some familiar marked-up charges, like the sling you can buy at Walgreens for $15 but for which you or your insurer get a bill for $120 after it is given to you at urgent care.
The policy has also led to widespread abuse, with patients sent home with equipment they donâ€™t need: My momâ€™s apartment, for example, holds an unused wheelchair, a walker and a commode paid for by Medicare, by which I mean our tax dollars.
Itâ€™s as if you were given a swag bag at a conference and then sent a bill for hundreds or thousands of dollars.
At least with swag, you get to keep it.
My husbandâ€™s hardly worn neck brace didnâ€™t even come home with us as a souvenir.
2.
The Cover Charge The biggest single item on Andrejâ€™s E.R.
bill was a $7,143.99 trauma activation fee.
What was that for, since every component of his care had been billed and billed handsomely?
Among the line items: $3,400 for a high-level E.R.
visit.
$1,030 for the trauma surgeon.
Between $1,400 and $3,300 for five purported CT scans.
And I say â€œpurportedâ€ because one trip into a scanner examined the head, upper spine and maxillofacial bones, but was billed as three separate things.
There was also an administration fee of more than $350 each for four injections.
Trauma activation fees have been allowed since 2002, after 9/11, when the Trauma Center Association of America, an industry group, convinced regulators that they needed to be compensated for maintaining a state of â€œreadiness.â€  Wait.
Isnâ€™t the purpose of an E.R.
to be â€œreadyâ€?
Isnâ€™t that why the doctorsâ€™ services and scans are billed at higher rates when they are performed in an emergency department?
Despite scrutiny from researchers about whether trauma fees are deserved, trauma activation fees have only grown in size, 15 percent annually in recent years, and can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars.
(On average, Medicare pays a fee of about $1,000.)
Some have likened trauma activation fees to a cover charge for being wheeled into an E.R.
with major trauma.
But does a cover charge typically cost more than the meal?
3.
Impostor Billing We received bills from doctors my husband never met.
Some of these bills were understandable, like for the radiologist who read the scans.
But others were for bedside treatment from people who never came anywhere near the bed to deliver the care.
Andrej had a small finger fracture with a cut that needed some stitches, which a resident, a surgeon-in-training, sutured.
But the $1,512 billed came in the name of a senior surgeon, as if he had done the work.
Physicians and many other health professionals are allowed to bill for the work of â€œextendersâ€ â€” stand-ins with less training who see patients and work under the supervising doctor.
These might be residents, physician assistants or nurse anesthetists, for example.
For billing purposes, this allows the senior providers to be in two, three, sometimes more than half a dozen places at once, often even when they are physically miles away.
The resident did a fine job on my husband.
But if an assistant did the work, shouldnâ€™t it be billed for less?
At law firms, the hourly rates for paralegals and junior attorneys are lower than those for partners.
On a website called Clinical Advisor, a reimbursement expert himself seemed to wonder at the professionâ€™s luck that such billing is tolerated: â€œI hear people ask, â€˜How can I do that?
The doctor never saw the patient, never had any interaction with the patient and yet I can still bill this service under the physician?â€™â€  4.
The Drive-By The day before Andrej left the hospital, a physical therapist visited and asked a few questions.
From that brief encounter, the therapist noted â€œambulation deficits, balance deficits, endurance deficits, pain-limiting function, transfer deficits.â€ That translated into a bill of $646.15 for what was recorded as a P.T.
evaluation â€œ1st session only (billable).â€ He said he was there for 30 minutes, but he was not.
He said he walked Andrej up 10 steps with a stabilizing belt for assistance.
He did not.
There was no significant health service given.
Just an appearance and some boxes checked on a form.
Itâ€™s a phenomenon called drive-by doctoring.
More shockingly, the drive-bys continued at our home, presaged by a call on Andrejâ€™s cellphone a day after he was discharged.
A physical therapist from a private company wanted to visit him for at-home therapy.
In his discharge instructions, no one had mentioned this service, and his injury was clearly too fresh to benefit.
She came.
She didnâ€™t know which body part had been injured and concluded he was in too much pain to participate.
The same company called twice more the following week to schedule visits.
By the third time, I told Andrej not to open the front door.
Nonetheless, our insurer was billed â€” and paid â€” for three visits.
Itâ€™s as if Alexa noticed that my dishwasher makes too much noise (it does) and took it upon herself to send over a repair guy.
But if I turned him away at the front door, saying Iâ€™m O.K.
with the racket (I am), would I still be billed for the visit?
5.
The Enforced Upgrade One Monday when Andrej was in pain and out of pills, the trauma doctor suggested we meet in the emergency room, because the trauma clinic was open only from 8 to 10:45 a.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
So we met the trauma doctors in the E.R., and they talked to Andrej, who remained in his street clothes.
They gave him a prescription.
Because the interaction â€” which could have happened in the lobby â€” happened in the E.R., it resulted in an E.R.
visit charge of $1,330.
But when the trauma clinic is open less than six hours a week, billing for an E.R.
visit that doesnâ€™t tap into any of the emergency room resources feels like a scam.
Is an E.R.
visit determined by the content of the services rendered, or merely by the location?
Andrej had a similar experience when his broken finger was treated with a plastic splint that folded over his fingertip.
He complained because the upper layer pressed on the fracture.
At a follow-up visit, someone took a pair of scissors and cut off the upper half of the splint and taped the lower half back in place.
That translated into a $481 charge for â€œsurgery,â€ in addition to the $375 charge for the office visit and a $103 facility fee.
Doesnâ€™t surgery, by definition, involve cutting into flesh or an animate object â€” not a piece of plastic?
Sure, it sounds fancy to upgrade a meeting to an E.R.
visit, or to call the tweaking of a splint â€œsurgery,â€ but if an airline overbooks my flight and puts me on another flight where the only seat available is in first class, it does not charge me for the more expensive ticket.
My insurer paid for most of these questionable charges, though at discounted rates.
But even a discounted payment for something that never really happened or didnâ€™t need to happen or that we didnâ€™t agree to have happen is still, according to common sense, a fraud.
Why do insurers pay?
Partly because insurers have no way to know whether you got a particular item or service.
But also because itâ€™s not worth their time to investigate the millions of medical interactions they write checks for each day.
Despite the advertised concern about your well-being, as one benefits manager enlightened me: Theyâ€™re â€œtoo big to care about you.â€ Electronic records, which auto-fill billing boxes, have probably made things worse.
For example, the birth of a baby boy may automatically prompt a bill for a circumcision; having day surgery may prompt a check for sedation.
So what is the appropriate payment for swag I didnâ€™t ask for, outrageous cover charges, stand-in doctors, drive-by visits and faux surgery?
In some cases, zero; in others, far less than was paid.
And yet, these are all everyday, normal experiences in todayâ€™s health care system, and they may be perfectly legal.
If we want to tame the costs in our $3 trillion health system, weâ€™ve got to rein in this behavior, which is fraud by any other name.
Why America Needs a Royal Family By Jennifer Weiner Jan. 10, 2020  Like everyone else on the internet, Iâ€™ve been watching the royal rumble, as Prince Harry and his American bride are attempting to carve out new roles in the royal family, and Iâ€™ve reached a conclusion: We, the American people, need some royals of our own.
I know.
Youâ€™re thinking: Didnâ€™t we fight a revolution so we wouldnâ€™t have kings?
Arenâ€™t monarchies expensive and arenâ€™t European nations streamlining their monarchies for this very reason?
And isnâ€™t Prince Harry quitting so that he wonâ€™t have to participate in an archaic, obsolete system with unpleasant echoes of imperialism and elitism that has made his wife a target for racists?
All true.
But hear me out, because, as the House of Windsor burns, and as recriminations ricochet from Instagram to the tabloids, with courtiers and conference calls and competing tales of who knew what when, thereâ€™s the kernel of something that might be worth pulling out of the dumpster fire and reinventing as our own.
Based on my understanding of British government (which, full disclosure, is largely informed by memories of my 10th-grade world history class, plus three seasons of â€œThe Crownâ€), the prime minister and Parliament are democratically elected, and do the actual governing, while the dynastic, unelected royals have ceremonial roles.
The kings and queens and their offspring live in the palace, wear fabulous jewels, drive (or are driven) in fancy cars to events like Trooping the Color (excuse me, the Colour) and Swan Upping, which sounds made up, but isnâ€™t, all while draining the nationâ€™s coffers to the tune of some Â£82.4 million this year (per the royal family) or Â£345 million (per Republic, a group that advocates abolition of the monarchy).
The subjects pay the bills, and, in return, the royals live their lives in public, enjoying various rich-people pursuits, attending weddings in nice clothes and the aforementioned jewelry, cutting ribbons, standing on balconies and waving.
They are Englandâ€™s celebrities in chief, the stars of one of the worldâ€™s longest-running reality shows.
They either serve as expensive anachronisms or useful distractions, depending on whom you ask.
â€œThatâ€™s the thing about the monarchy,â€ says Helena Bonham Carter, playing Princess Margaret on Season 3â€™s finale of â€œThe Crown.â€ â€œWe paper over the cracks.â€  The problem with a real-time soap opera that draws the entire worldâ€™s attention is that very few people are equipped to be its stars.
Recent history proves the point: the beautiful princess becoming a desperately unhappy young mother who dies tragically, trying to escape the paparazzi (rest in peace, Princess Diana).
Her husband, the dashing prince, caught on tape musing about becoming his mistressâ€™s tampon (really, whoâ€™s writing this dialogue?).
An uncle, bounced out of the family business after consorting with a notorious pedophile.
Is it any wonder that we now have a prince who wants to be written off the show, or, at the very least, become a recurring guest star, not a series regular?
In the United States, meanwhile, we expect our elected officials, with their unelected spouses and children, to serve that public, ceremonial role.
Which has meant First Children going through adolescence on the world stage, and spouses whoâ€™ve worked as lawyers and teachers pressed into thankless, unsalaried and highly-scrutinized service as hostesses in chief.
Wouldnâ€™t it make sense to separate those spheres, the way they have in Iceland, where thereâ€™s an elected president to handle ceremonial tasks, and a prime minister to govern?
We, too, could give the power to an elected official and keep a different person around to handle the hosting/ribbon cutting/Rose Garden tour-leading/gossip lightning-rod stuff.
We could keep it simple and give the gig to Miss America, whoâ€™s already been chosen and already has a tiara.
Or we could have a televised reality contest (a roy-ality contest â€” see what I did there?)
to elect our king and queen.
We could recruit the glittering couples we think would be best suited for the job of representing America on the world stage (BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z!
Jennifer Lopez and A-Rod!
George and Amal Clooney!
Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman!
Ina Garten and Jeffrey!).
We would put the would-be royals through their paces â€” can she keep her cool while shaking hands in four-inch heels for three hours?
Can he entertain foreign dignitaries, even if he doesnâ€™t speak their language?
Can they wrangle a gaggle of corgis or visiting college football champs?
Do they look good in funny hats?
We let people vote.
We move the winners into the White House and relocate the president into some nearby, more modest digs.
Then, we let the president govern, while our king and queen cut the ribbons and host state dinners, pardon the Thanksgiving turkeys and light the Christmas tree.
We give them a salary and strict instructions about the values they are to uphold (one single brooch like Princess Michael of Kentâ€™s, and youâ€™re out).
And we give them crowns and titles because symbols have weight and meaning, and because fairy tales and hallmark movies have trained us to believe that precious metal headgear and titles confer prestige and desirability.
Thereâ€™s a reason we arenâ€™t all bingeing a Netflix series called â€œThe Baseball Capâ€; a reason that â€” no offense, Iceland â€” Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty dream of a prince and not a president.
Elected royal couples would eliminate the problem of the unpaid first ladies, shifting the burden of being a hostess, a charity patron and a fashion plate onto the shoulders of someone who has skills for it, allowing the presidentâ€™s spouse to continue on whatever path he or she previously chose â€” health care administrator, librarian, lawyer, Pilates-class frequenter.
Even better, it would eradicate the possibility of a president who would rather be a king.
Any candidates who prefer campaigning to governing, who would rather speak at a rally than sit through a briefing, or who understand the hierarchies of Fox News but do not seem to have read the Constitution can run to be a royal, not a president.
Give the power, with no crown, to the hard-working, camera-shy introverts; give a crown, with no power, to the preening spotlight hogs.
For all we know, Prince Charles, whoâ€™s been kind of a yawn as a royal, could have been a solid politician, and our disastrous president might have been at least a contained disaster as King Donald the First.
Why Donald Trump Hates Your Dog By Frank Bruni Nov. 5, 2019  Reaching for verbs to describe Abu Bakr al-Baghdadiâ€™s final moments, President Trump grabbed hold of â€œcrying,â€ â€œscreamingâ€ and â€œwhimpering.â€  Reaching for nouns, he said that al-Baghdadi died â€œlike a dog.â€  I wasnâ€™t aware that canines expired in a signature fashion, but Trump knows best, even if he doesnâ€™t know so very many words.
About a week later, when he took characteristically nasty note of Beto Oâ€™Rourkeâ€™s decision to abandon the presidential race, he said that Oâ€™Rourke quit â€œlike a dog.â€  Some similes demand repetition.
This wasnâ€™t one of them.
But a lack of verbal ingenuity never stopped Trump.
And an animus toward a certain animal has long, well, hounded him.
In his boundless unoriginality, he has likened women he dislikes to dogs.
In his infinite incoherence, he has repeatedly tweeted of people being fired like dogs.
I personally havenâ€™t met all that many gainfully employed pooches, unless digging holes in the backyard is a profession, and when those excavators received orders to desist, none of them got a pink slip and a referral to career counseling.
Trump did recently make the acquaintance â€” from a distance â€” of a dog with a bona fide job.
That dog is a Belgian Malinois named Conan.
And Conanâ€™s job, brilliantly executed, was to find, chase and corner al-Baghdadi.
Trump called Conan â€œa beautiful dog, a talented dog.â€ The New York Post put Conanâ€™s picture on its front page, along with the headline â€œZero Bark Thirty.â€ Trump also tweeted a Photoshopped image in which he draped a medal around Conanâ€™s neck.
So this Malinois warrants decoration while â€œa dogâ€ gets derision?
Or is it just that every dog has its day?
I used to believe that adage until Trump came along.
He has had more than 1,000 days in the presidency, even as the White House goes to the dogs.
Journalists with many news organizations (The Washington Post, New York magazine, Slate and more) have had a field day with Trumpâ€™s dogged use of â€œdogâ€ as an all-purpose put-down.
When it comes to â€œlike a dog,â€ heâ€™s like a dog with a bone.
Youâ€™re no one until heâ€™s divined the flea-bitten mongrel within you â€” and youâ€™ve joined a dog pound that includes the likes of Mitt Romney, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, Bill Maher, Steve Bannon, George Will, Omarosa Manigault Newman, my fellow Times columnist Gail Collins and many more.
Fun doggy factoids cling to him like so much Samoyed fur.
Heâ€™s the first president in more than a century who doesnâ€™t have a dog.
According to the Chinese zodiac, he was born in the year of the dog.
According to Ivana Trump, he provoked growls from her dog, Chappy, a poodle who could suss out a peacock.
The mediaâ€™s nickname for his first defense secretary, James Mattis, was â€œmad dog.â€ And from the forehead up, heâ€™s a dead ringer for a distressed Pomeranian.
But no one has definitively solved the riddle of what seems like a rabid case of canine contempt.
I have my own theories, but first I have the more erudite insights of Justin Frank, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst and the author of the book â€œTrump on the Couch.â€  Frank noted that Trump is â€œphobic about germsâ€ and no doubt sees dogs as four-legged germ factories.
He probably also thinks â€œdogs are stupid because they obey,â€ Frank said.
Disobedience is Trumpâ€™s preferred posture, at least for himself, although he broke with that to become, in Frankâ€™s words, â€œPutinâ€™s lap dog.â€ Disobedience, that is, and distemper.
Frank raised another issue that the president might well have with dogs: When theyâ€™re around, they often steal attention, becoming the objects of peopleâ€™s oohing and cooing.
Trump likes the oohing all to himself.
My own sense?
For Trump, all relationships are transactional and Godâ€™s creatures possess value only in accordance with their ability to elevate and enrich him.
His affection for Kellyanne Conway hinges on her superhuman power not to break into laughter or spontaneously combust when she puts the most ludicrously adulatory spin on his most transparently execrable deeds.
If border collies performed that trick, he would keep a kennel of them at Mar-a-Loco.
His regard for Rudy Giuliani depends on the hunched henchmanâ€™s openness to unscrupulous errands.
If Doberman pinschers could pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, Trump would repurpose Camp David as a dog run and turn Ivankaâ€™s pumps into chew toys.
But they canâ€™t, just as Siberian huskies canâ€™t hack Democratsâ€™ emails â€” for that, a husky Siberian is handier â€” and golden retrievers canâ€™t retrieve gold.
Dogs are useless to Trump, at least by the criteria he cares about.
Thereâ€™s no money in most of them, no votes in any of them, and they canâ€™t play golf with him and tell him along the way what a manly drive and graceful putt he has.
Thatâ€™s lucky for Lindsey Graham, who would otherwise be swapped out for a Labradoodle lickety-split.
Conan passed muster only by being a proxy for Trumpâ€™s own imagined machismo.
Maybe Chappy was merely yappy.
Like a Donald.
Why Trump Persists By Thomas B. Edsall Jan. 22, 2020  The failure of the American electorate to rise up in opposition to President Trump â€” whose outrages are well-documented â€” suggests that voters are less tolerant, less empathetic and less insistent on integrity than many believe.
The election of Trump and his first three years in office have revealed a nation deeply ambivalent about immigration, race, equality, fairness â€” even about the ground rules of democracy itself.
What if the belief systems used to justify anti-immigrant policies and to justify race prejudice, for that matter â€” hostility to outsiders, insularity, high sensitivity to external threat â€” are as deeply ingrained in the American body politic as belief systems sympathetic to immigration and to racial equality â€” openness, receptivity to new experiences, trust?
Karen Stenner, a political psychologist and behavioral economist best known for â€œpredicting the rise of Trump-like figures under the kinds of conditions we now confront,â€ responded to my emailed inquiries by noting the conflicting pressures at play: I donâ€™t think I would agree that Trumpian conservative stands on immigration, race and homelessness are a more â€œnaturalâ€ or â€œdefaultâ€ position.
Communities with a good balance of people who seek out diversity, complexity, novelty, new and exciting experiences etc., and those who are disgusted by and averse to such things, avoid them, and tell others to do likewise, tend to thrive and prosper in human evolution.
Finding the right balance, Stenner said, â€œis vital to both societal cohesion and human flourishing.â€ But, she warned, â€œwe may have tipped the balance too far in favor of unconstrained diversity and complexity,â€ pushing the boundary beyond â€œmany peopleâ€™s capacity to tolerate it.â€  At this juncture, she argued, we need to tinker with that balance and get it right for everyone.
So thereâ€™s the paradox of our times: it is likely that rather less liberal democracy will ultimately make liberal democracy more secure.
Among liberals, Stenner argued, the greatest ambivalence â€œattaches to immigration issues,â€ and that ambivalence is only worsened by the unwillingness of liberals to accept an open debate in which immigration opponents can â€œexpress their fears and concerns, without being called racists.â€  Suzette Brooks Masters â€” who has written extensively about immigrant integration, detention, employment-based immigration and the immigrantsâ€™ rights field generally â€” made a parallel point in her recent study of immigration, â€œChange is Hardâ€: Academics agree that it is the pace of change relative to the composition of the receiving community that matters most.
Simply put, if a place is already quite diverse, making it more diverse matters less.
Even significant inflows of diverse newcomers will be perceived as less threatening because the community has already adapted to greater diversity.
By contrast, in a relatively homogeneous location, even small absolute numbers of newcomers, such as refugees, can be disruptive and activate cultural anxiety.
Jonathan Haidt, a professor at NYUâ€™s Stern School of Business, offered a similarly nuanced examination of how the balance between tribalism and openness might play out.
Tribalism, he wrote by email, is not a mindless and eternal â€œus versus themâ€ mentality.
It is a set of psychological adaptations that make people respond to threats and intergroup competition with an urge to band together, enforce loyalty to the team, and guard boundaries or territory.
In the political arena, Haidt continued, if one gains prestige for outdoing others on oneâ€™s devotion to sacred values â€” such as guarding Americaâ€™s borders, on the right, or being antiracist on the left â€” then the partyâ€™s rhetoric will shift to the extremes, with candidates making more extreme proposals that gain them prestige.
The pressures to go to extremes, Haidt suggested, are â€œroughly symmetrical between left and right.â€  John R. Hibbing, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska, takes a more uncompromising stance.
In an email, he wrote: Though consideration of such matters is always speculative, suggesting the possibility that conservative orientations, particularly on topics such as immigration and race, are evolutionarily more primal is perfectly reasonable.
In their book â€œPredisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences,â€ Hibbing, Kevin B. Smith, of the University of Nebraska, and John R. Alford, of Rice, argue that liberalism is â€œan evolutionary luxuryâ€ that can emerge in people when â€œnegative stimuli becoming less prevalent and less deadly,â€ or, as Hibbing put it in an email, â€œwhen daily threats to life and limb posed by other human beings have diminished.â€  Conversely, they write, if the environment shifts back to a â€œthreat-filled atmosphere,â€ then â€œpositive selection for conservative orientations would reappear.â€  Letâ€™s take a look at one of the core divisions between liberals and conservatives: the causes of poverty.
The right tends to blame individual failings while the left tends to place the onus on economic and political forces.
The accompanying chart, created from 2019 Voter Study Group data by Zach Goldberg, a doctoral candidate in political science at Georgia State, shows the difference.
Linda J. Skitka, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and four colleagues conducted an intriguing set of tests to determine the durability and strength of liberal and conservative beliefs on poverty in a 2002 paper, â€œDispositions, Scripts, or Motivated Correction?
Understanding Ideological Differences in Explanations for Social Problems.â€  They found that in troubled times, when competition for limited goods intensifies, liberals move to the right: It is much easier to get a liberal to behave like a conservative than it is to get a conservative to behave like a liberal.
Liberals act like conservatives when resources are scarce, cognitive load is high, and aid serves secondary rather than primary needs.
Conservatives only act like liberals when they are asked to consider helping a person with internally controllable causes of need who has convincingly reformed.
In an email, Skitka provided some reasons for this difference: My research has found that holding people responsible for their plight is a more natural response than feeling sympathetic to those in need.
Under most conditions, liberals are more sympathetic to the needy in large part because they are more likely to attribute the causes of their need to something about the situation.
Conservatives, in contrast, tend to attribute the causes of peopleâ€™s need to something about the needy person: They donâ€™t work hard enough, etc.
Because blaming the individual is a default or fallback position, liberals have to go through a â€œmore cognitively effortfulâ€ process to reach their less â€œnaturalâ€ conclusion â€” â€œpeople have to basically override a more natural inclination to make dispositional attributions instead,â€ according to Skitka.
As a result, she continued, under certain pressures, liberals respond to the needy more like conservatives when resources are scarce or when they are under a lot of cognitive load (e.g., they are distracted), or their ability to engage in self-control is reduced (e.g., when under the influence of alcohol).
The left-right differences over the causes of poverty apply to other controversial subjects highly salient in contemporary American politics, Skitka and her colleagues write: Liberals tend to focus on situational or institutional explanations for things like homelessness or why people commit crimes, whereas conservatives tend to focus on personal explanations for the same phenomena.
Skitka and her fellow authors received strong support for their argument in a 2012 paper, â€œLow-Effort Thought Promotes Political Conservatism,â€ by Scott Eidelman, a professor of psychology at the University of Arkansas, and three co-authors.
Eidelman and his colleagues conducted a series of tests comparing the answers of two groups to ideologically revealing questions.
The first faced time pressure or were forced to answer with distracting background noises, in environments â€œtaxing, limiting or otherwise disengaging effortful, deliberative thought.â€ The second group was asked the same questions with plenty of time to think and without noise or other distractions.
In each case, those tested under favorable circumstances provided more liberal answers than those tested under more hostile conditions.
The adverse conditions forced those participants to perform what the authors called â€œlow-effort thinking,â€ and the results showed that â€œlow-effort thinking promotes political conservatism.â€  In one of their four experiments, the authors went to an unidentified bar in New England and persuaded 85 drinkers to take the test and have their alcohol levels measured.
The results: Bar patrons reported more conservative attitudes as their level of alcohol intoxication increased.
Because alcohol limits cognitive capacity and disrupts controlled responding, while leaving automatic thinking largely intact, these data are consistent with our claim that low-effort thinking promotes political conservatism.
Diana Mutz, a professor of political science and communication at the University of Pennsylvania, pointed out that one effect of increasing education levels is to fundamentally change individual world views.
â€œThe one sense in which there is evidence that we do â€˜overcomeâ€™ our tendencies toward tribalism is through education,â€ she wrote by email.
â€œEvery study Iâ€™ve ever seen across the social sciences shows that education promotes less in-group favoritism and greater tolerance toward those unlike ourselves,â€ she continued.
â€œIn panel studies that track the same people over time, as people gain advanced levels of education, they become more tolerant and favorable toward liberal democratic norms.â€  One scholar who has devoted much of his career to the study of the transition in developed countries from materialist to post-materialist values â€” from a value orientation that emphasizes economic and physical security to one that emphasizes self-expression and quality of life â€” is Ronald Inglehart, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan.
He sees a generalized transition to more liberal world views â€” perhaps as a concomitant of voters with college and graduate school degrees.
â€œLiberal values are not a veneer, masking a much less pleasant reality,â€ Inglehart pointed out in an email.
â€œA sizable and growing segmentâ€ of the American public, he wrote, â€œhas tolerant liberal views and these views are deep-rooted and enduring.â€  Inglehartâ€™s research has found that those who developed postmaterialist values (which strongly correlate with what you think of as â€œliberalâ€ values) in their pre-adult years, remained relatively postmaterialist 40 years later.
Materialists and postmaterialists take opposing sides in response to these statements: A woman has to/doesnâ€™t have to have children to be fulfilled; I would/wouldnâ€™t want foreigners, homosexuals or people with AIDS as neighbors; A child needs/does not need a home with both a father and a mother in order to grow up happily; Imagination is/is not one of the most important things to teach a child; Men do/donâ€™t make better political leaders than women; Homosexuality is/is never justifiable.
From 1970 to the present, the ratio of materialists to postmaterialists has gone from 4-1 to 1-1, according to Inglehart.
Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard whose research has demonstrated the precariousness of liberal racial commitments when tested in real world circumstances, replied by email to my inquiries: There is no doubt that there is more ambivalence on these issues among liberals and moderates than is reflected in the polls.
In addition to the pressures of â€œsocial desirability biasâ€ to give the liberal answer, Enos wrote, others will lie to themselves, telling themselves they believe something that they really donâ€™t; and others are liberal in theory, but less so in practice when it comes to things like homelessness in their own city or neighborhood.
There are other sources of internal tension and conflicting interests among Democrats and liberals.
I have written frequently on the problems confronting the â€œupstairs-downstairsâ€ Democratic coalition â€” combining well-educated, relatively affluent voters who are disproportionately white with poor and working class voters who are heavily minority.
In his book, â€œPolitics Is for Power: How to Move Beyond Political Hobbyism, Take Action, and Make Real Change,â€ and in an Atlantic article, Eitan Hersh, a political scientist at Tufts, has focused on the relatively weaker commitments of the upscale constituency of the Democratic coalition to policy initiatives aimed at providing substantive help.
Many college-educated people â€œthink they are deeply engaged in politics,â€ Hersh wrote in the Atlantic: They follow the news â€” reading articles like this one â€” and debate the latest developments on social media.
They might sign an online petition or throw a $5 online donation at a presidential candidate.
In fact, he argues, their consumption of political information is a way of satisfying their own emotional and intellectual needs.
These people are political hobbyists.
What they are doing is no closer to engaging in politics than watching SportsCenter is to playing football.
Hersh is hard on these voters, a group he describes as â€œcollege-educated white people, a demographic group that is now predominately Democratic.â€  These voters, he writes, do politics as hobbyists because they can.
On the political left, they may say they fear President Donald Trump.
They may lament polarization.
But they are pretty comfortable with the status quo.
They do not feel a sense of obligation, of â€œlinked fate,â€ to people who have concrete needs such that they are willing to be their allies.
They might front as allies on social media, but very few white liberals are actively engaging in face-to-face political organizations, committing their time to fighting for racial equality or any other issue they say they care about.
Why does all this matter?
What difference does it make if liberals and Democrats are more ambivalent than conservatives and Republicans?
For one thing, it means that in elections that are increasingly negative, ambivalent partisans â€” Democrats in this case â€” will be more vulnerable to attacks designed to generate conflict, to weaken enthusiasm and to increase the likelihood of nonvoting.
President Trump and the proponents of the Republican Party he dominates are certain to do all they can to capitalize on this vulnerability.
Most importantly, Democratic ambivalence, in a year when high turnout is mandatory, reflects the larger problem facing a political party that is now focused on its shared animosity to Trump.
That animosity may or may not be enough to propel its presidential candidate to victory, but the inherent tension between different sectors of the center-left coalition over ideological, economic and social issues â€” not to mention glaring levels of intraparty income inequality â€” calls into question exactly what common ground holds the Democratic coalition together.
How common is it?
Brexit Has Arrived.
But Boris Johnsonâ€™s Reign Is Just Beginning.
By Richard Seymour Jan. 31, 2020  LONDON â€” The moment has arrived.
Britain is out of the European Union.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his â€œPeopleâ€™s Governmentâ€ â€” it scarcely calls itself Conservative at this point â€” has fulfilled the promise on which it was elected in December and â€œgot Brexit done.â€  There are difficulties ahead.
Mr. Johnson has promised impossible and contradictory things on Brexit: Maximum regulatory freedom where it suits his government, maximum frictionless trade where it suits the British economy.
The European Union is unlikely to give him what he wants in the months of negotiations to come.
But by fulfilling his pledge, Mr. Johnson has won enormous good will from nationalist voters across England and Wales.
Outside the European Union, he will also have more scope to change the British governmentâ€™s role in the economy.
This gives him a unique opportunity do what his predecessors could not: build a lasting popular base for the Conservative Party.
Mr. Johnson can now take advantage of his big majority to overhaul British capitalism, incentivizing long-term Conservative voters while permanently annexing chunks of the Labour Partyâ€™s historic base.
Already, the dimensions of Mr. Johnsonâ€™s plans are becoming clear.
He has no intention of running the country as any Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher would have: He is not out to roll back the state.
Instead, he is out to secure the support of working-class voters who handed over to the Tories dozens of seats formerly held by Labour.
His premiership, set free by Brexit, could reshape Britainâ€™s electoral map for decades.
During the election, Mr. Johnson campaigned as an almost single-issue nationalist, the phrase â€œget Brexit doneâ€ falling robotically from his lips between every other stammer.
Beyond that, much of what he said was conventionally Tory: He promised harsher restrictions on immigration, meaning an end to free movement from the European Union and the expansion of the â€œhostile environmentâ€ for migrants.
Domestic repression, the manifesto promised, would also tighten, with a bigger penal system and a greater emphasis on â€œcounter-extremism,â€ which, as Home Secretary Priti Patel has indicated, will target parts of the left.
Mr. Johnson has also hinted at constitutional reforms, which would strengthen the executive and weaken judicial challenges.
He promises an attack on liberal norms and legality in the name of national invigoration.
Tellingly, he distanced himself from the last government.
He would end austerity, raise spending on the National Health Service, guarantee pensions, raise the minimum wage and borrow Â£100 billion to invest in infrastructure.
Many of these promises were grossly exaggerated, but they served to underline the point that a Johnson administration would be different.
And since the election, the government has acted to carry out its commitments, passing legislation to guarantee N.H.S.
spending increases and proposing moderate improvements to workersâ€™ and rentersâ€™ rights.
It has also promised that most of the infrastructure spending will be invested in Englandâ€™s deprived northern regions â€” and this week backed up the promise by nationalizing the northâ€™s major rail service.
If this sounds like an incursion into Labour territory, it is.
Many of the policies are directly taken from Labourâ€™s plans.
The push for a larger state resonates with a politically ambiguous popular memory of the postwar era â€” a certain nostalgia for the era of big, dynamic industries owned by the British government inflects both a version of the left-wing politics of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and a version of Brexit sentiment.
Mr. Johnson knows that many of the votes contributing to a Conservative majority were â€œlentâ€ by voters who wanted Brexit done.
A more interventionist state is a way to shore up a lasting, broad coalition.
This pragmatic raid on enemy turf was first conceived under Mr. Johnsonâ€™s predecessor, Theresa May.
More thoughtful Tories knew they had to change.
The British state and economy had become dysfunctional: gaping regional inequalities, a housing market inaccessible to younger workers, weak labor productivity, sluggish investment and very little to export.
Mrs. Mayâ€™s advisers understood that the Conservatives had to break with the formula of austerity and financialization somehow.
But while she used the rhetoric of working-class uplift, she was unable to back it up with policy.
Her chancellor, Philip Hammond, a traditional ally of the banks, was determined to keep austerity going.
If nothing else, he could see no other way to create a fiscal surplus big enough to soften the impact of Brexit.
Mr. Johnson, by contrast, is just enough of an opportunist to see that delivering Brexit, in however self-injuring and punitive a form, gives him both the political power and the regulatory latitude to do things differently.
There is a risk, though, of succumbing to Mr. Johnsonâ€™s own mythmaking.
As much as he needs working-class conservatives, they have always existed.
And the core Tory voter remains the affluent middle class.
Whatâ€™s more, when it comes to public spending, heâ€™s limited in what he can do by his commitment to freezing most taxes.
In an economy that is already weak and likely to be weaker after Brexit, he has little room for serious investment.
And Mr. Johnson will face conflicting demands from within his own party.
The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has demanded 5 percent cuts from most government departments, making plain that the spending spigots are not about to freely flow.
And the prime minister is surrounded by allies who, far from wanting a more interventionist state, want to cut taxes and slash regulations in the interests of a more globally competitive economy.
During the election, Mr. Johnson was able to glide over the glaring contradictions in what he said with a bustling con manâ€™s charm, but in office he has to navigate them.
With a big majority, he can no longer play the outsider.
However, the lesson of nationalist leaders globally is that, in this jittery era, they donâ€™t have to deliver booming success to keep power.
From Viktor Orban in Hungary to Narendra Modi in India, these leaders have expanded their base by delivering a personalized, charismatic form of rule in which they are militant defenders of the nation against all comers â€” be they foreigners, â€œtraitors,â€ liberals, or leftists.
Mr. Johnson is not a nationalist by conviction.
He is the epitome of the â€œreckless opportunistsâ€ that, as the sociologist Aeron Davis says, run Britain.
His voting record in Parliament shows him to be slightly more liberal than his party.
But his performance over the last few months â€” during which he agitated against Parliament, accused opponents of â€œcollaborationâ€ with Europe, and saber-rattled against the courts and media â€” showed him to be adept at using the far rightâ€™s template.
Whenever the contradictions in his government threaten to unravel, he is likely to return to these tactics.
Indeed, Brexit fits in with that method perfectly.
After today, Mr. Johnson will be able to continually remind voters that he was able to overcome the hostility of the liberal elite and accomplish his goal.
And as negotiations proceed, he can gin up hostility against his supposed enemies whenever he doesnâ€™t get his way.
Whenever any politician claims to speak for â€œthe people,â€ someone always pays the price.
Migrants are first on the list for Mr. Johnson.
But they will not be the last.
