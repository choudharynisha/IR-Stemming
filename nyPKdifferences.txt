< perch atop a hillock overlook the sprawl capit the templ is a microcosm of a new civil religion take shape in china — an effort by the chines communist parti to satisfi chines people’ search for moral guidelin by supplement the larg irrelev ideolog of commun with a curat version of the past 
< thi new stateguid religios is the flip side of the government’ harsh polici toward islam and christian 
< offici believ these two global faith are hard to control becaus of their foreign tie and they have use negoti or forc — diplomaci with the vatican arrest of promin protest intern camp for muslim — to tri to bring these religion to heel 
< yet beijing’ recent turn to tradit may be even more signific 
< even though islam and christian are world religion in china they remain minor with the number of their combin adher amount to less than 10 percent of the popul 
< most chines believ in an amalgam of buddhism taoism confucian and other tradit valu and idea that still reson deepli 
< for thi silent major of hundr of million of peopl the government’ newfound support for thing like the templ to lord guan is welcom — a feel that the chines communist parti hope will bolster it legitimaci especi given the irrelev today of it found idea 
< the benefit of it move to embrac the past may seem obviou but the shift mark a radic departur not just for a parti offici commit to atheism but also from how reform over the past centuri have imagin a modern prosper china 
< from the 19th centuri onward china’ elit argu that the country’ tradit and faith were a major reason for it declin 
< reform in 1898 call for templ to be convert into school 
< while the nationalist parti under chiang kaishek approv of four religion — buddhism taoism sometim call daoism christian and islam — it larg consid tradit chines belief to be superstit and advoc the destruct of templ

< when the communist took power in 1949 they like the nationalist offici recogn four religion — but then promptli began persecut them 
< tradit faith came under especi harsh treatment with the govern ban bedrock tradit practic from worship ancestor and local deiti to follow the advic of geomanc master and spirit medium 
< the three decad of reform that start in the late 1970 loosen control over societi allow the reviv of all religion and mani tradit that had been proscrib

< xi jinping’ rise to power in late 2012 mark a new era the third in the histori of the chines communist party’ religi polici 
< instead of the destruct of the mao year and the rel laissezfair approach of the reform period the state ha embark on a form of highli curat reviv

< last year beij struck a deal with the vatican to jointli appoint cathol bishop

< protestant pose an especi vex problem for the parti 
< it is arguabl china’ fastestgrow religion with an estim 60 million or more adher today compar with one million in 1949 includ some 20 to 30 million who are thought to worship in unregist or underground protest church 
< but the faith lack a unifi structur that would allow for negoti 
< and so the govern ha fire a few shot across the bow close sever of the country’ bestknown underground church 
< in mani way howev the xi administration’ embrac of tradit faith is more radic 
< sinc take offic the presid ha met with buddhist leader and hi govern ha allow taoism to flourish 
< the state recent issu a landmark plan to improv social more the first such program sinc 2001

< mani peopl do not trust one anoth 
< the government’ blueprint for handl thi moral crisi call for endors certain tradit belief 
< the epic paper — it run to 10000 chines charact and would be significantli longer translat into english — doesn’t mention communist china’ found father mao zedong or hi successor and their ideolog focus instead on mr xi and hi effort to fix social problem like money worship and hedon 
< it doe invok communist slogan such as core socialist valu but in contrast to the previou such document from 2001 — which made onli pass refer to chines tradit — it call the past a rich sourc of moral 
< the plan order parti offici to promot ancient and worthi sage as well as to deepli expound tradit concept such as ren’ai benevol zhengyi righteous and jianyi zhengwei stand up brave for the truth 
< thi effort is not an attempt to replac commun with confucian

> all translate here are mine 
> the second set of document a large cache of file and spreadsheet from local government reveal the internment campaign's devastating economic and social impact on the family and community it target 
> the telegram — dated nov 5 2017 and address to local politics and legal affair bureau — is marked extremely urgent and bear the secondhighest level of secrecy within china's classifieddocument scheme 
> it reveal the extent of the security and surveillance measure taken around the camp partly to shield the camp from external scrutiny 
> the message a directive note that the work conduct there is strict confidential and highly sensitive in nature 
> even staff at the camp are forbidden from aggregate detainee figures 
> the authorities' attempt to enforce absolute secrecy is confirmed by another document dated november 2018 this one from a local government file in hotan county 
> it chide official for not protect secret related to the internment campaign well enough 
> it stipulate that no person is under any circumstances permit to disseminate information about detention or reeducate via telephone smartphone or the internet and that official are strict forbidden from receiving related media interview or make unauthorized disclosure about the internment campaign 
> that the china authority so deliberate sought to shield from external scrutiny information about operation at the xinjiang camp suggest that they are only too aware of how incriminate their policy and practice are 
> i was also able to obtain a massive cache of local government file from within xinjiang 
> among the most revealing document are thousand of detailed spreadsheet with the name identification numbers and address of ten of thousand of people mostly uighur and many of them in detention prison or reeducate camp 
> in yarkand a county of about 800000 people in southwestern xinjiang 96 percent of the population is uighur 
> six official spreadsheet about six village dated 2018 show that on average nearly 16 percent of the rural adult population was either interne or in prison 
> in two village in kosherik township — which the document describe as heavy pollute by extremist ideology — nearly 60 percent of all household had one person or more interne 
> in addition to the extraordinary scale of the internment campaign the file reveal its devastating impact well beyond the camp — deep into the community and family of xinjiang 
> the spreadsheet show that the government has primarily target middleage men most often the head of the household and main wageearner 
> beijing's occasional tour of its socall model camp often feature attractive young women 
> in reality people between 30 and 59 were especially likely to be interne according to the spreadsheet 
> the policy's socioeconomic fallout is dire — and local government are keeping a meticulous record of it 
> one spreadsheet from 2017 for one town in yarkand county which list household with low income that might qualify for welfare included a young family with five children between the age of three and 14 
> the father had been imprison the mother placed in a reeducate camp and the children in effect orphan 
> in another hardly unusual case a household's two workingage parent were detain leave elderly grandparent — including a grandmother describe as seriously ill — to care for two toddler 
> in a column with the header reason for poverty the relevant spreadsheet offer this explanation lack labor force and finances 
> the toddlers' father isn't schedule to be release until 2030 
> another spreadsheet from september 2018 show lists of loan default in pile township akto county 
> in 80 percent of the case where the reason for default was list as internment most of the borrow funds were shown to still be in the bank 
> a particularly depress example come from a village in yarkand county 
> a uighur farmer and head of a family of five was interne in 2017 
> in october 2016 he had received a loan of 40000 renminbi nearly 5700 to purchase agriculture machinery 
> the equipment went unused during his detention — no other family member knew how to operate it — and the loan could not be repaid as schedule 
> the government direct the family to rent out the equipment and send its oldest child a son to work 
> the family was then officially marked as have been povertyalleviate by benefit from policy 
> in june 2018 after his release the farmer applied for financial assistance so he could repay the loan and related interest 
> in january 2019 he start to work in the yarkand county textile industrial park earn just 800 rmb about 113 a month 
> by then the son age 20 had somehow become disabled and was list on government form as unable to work 
> thanks to these new document disclosure we now have hard evidence — and the government's own evidence — that in addition to implement a vast internment program in xinjiang the china communist party is deliberate break up family and force them into poverty and a form of indenture labor 
> for all its effort at secrecy the china government can no long hide the extent and the reach of its campaign of repression in xinjiang 
> some important elements are still unknown 
> the total internment figure remains a wellguarde secret 
> base on the new evidence i have revise my own estimate i think that between 900000 and 18 million people have been detain in xinjiang since the spring of 2017 
> also missing from the official document that have surface so far are precise record of how the detainee are treat and how exactly the process of reeducate works 
> about those things however we have witness account 
> the confidential telegram and local file do not mention the use of physical violence — but for one notable exception 
> the telegram states that people who resist brainwashing must be single out for assaultstyle reeducate 
> yet another sinister understatement and it suggest that force and torture may in fact be widely use 
> in a way though we already know all that we really need to know 
> the document that have been disclose these past few week reveal the staggering scale of the repression in xinjiang and its ruinous effects on the region's ethnic community well beyond the camp themselves 
> consider this official statistics show that the combine net population growth rate of hotan and kashgar two of the largest uighur regions drop by about 84 percent between 2015 and 2018 
> the china communist party set out it claim to transform through education ethnic minority in xinjiang 
> in fact it is rip apart entire community and subjugate them on a colossal scale 
> and this at the direction of president xi himself 
> china's new civil religion by ian johnson dec 21 2019 beije — in the northern suburbs of this city is a small temple to a china folk deity lord guan a famous warrior deify more than a millennium ago 
> renovate five years ago at the government's expense the temple is use by a group of retire who run pilgrimage to a holy mountain schoolchildren who come to learn traditional culture and a taoist priest who preach to wealthy urbanite about the traditional value of ancient china 
> perch atop a hillock overlook the sprawl capital the temple is a microcosm of a new civil religion taking shape in china — an effort by the china communist party to satisfy china people's search for moral guidelines by supplement the largely irrelevant ideology of communism with a curate version of the past 
> this new stateguide religios is the flip side of the government's harsh policy toward islam and christianity 
> official believe these two global faith are hard to control because of their foreign tie and they have use negotiation or force — diplomacy with the vatican arrest of prominent protestant internment camp for muslim — to try to bring these religion to heel 
> yet beijing's recent turn to tradition may be even more significant 
> even though islam and christianity are world religion in china they remain minor with the number of their combine adherent amount to less than 10 percent of the population 
> most china believe in an amalgam of buddhism taoism confucianism and other traditional value and idea that still resonate deep 
> for this silent majority of hundred of million of people the government's newfound support for things like the temple to lord guan is welcome — a feeling that the china communist party hope will bolster its legitimacy especially given the irrelevance today of its found idea 
> the benefit of its move to embrace the past may seem obvious but the shift mark a radical departure not just for a party officially committed to atheism but also from how reform over the past century have imagine a modern prosperous china 
> from the 19th century onward china's elite argue that the country's tradition and faith were a major reason for its decline 
> reform in 1898 call for temple to be convert into school 
> while the nationalist party under chiang kaishek approve of four religion — buddhism taoism sometimes call dao christianity and islam — it largely considered traditional china belief to be superstition and advocate the destruction of temple 
> scholar estimate that by the middle of the 20th century half of the temple that exist in china at the end of the 19th century had been destroy 
> an 1851 survey of the old city of beije list 866 temple today i count just 18 
> at the end of the 19th century most village had at least one temple and many had half a dozen vast section of the china countryside now have no temple at all 
> when the communist took power in 1949 they like the nationalist officially recognize four religion — but then prompt began persecute them 
> traditional faith came under especially harsh treatment with the government ban bedrock traditional practice from worship ancestor and local deity to following the advice of geomance master and spirit medium 
> the three decade of reform that start in the late 1970s loosen control over society allow the revival of all religion and many tradition that had been proscribe 
> despite periodic crackdown church and mosque but also temple were rebuilt and clergy train 
> although all faith were supposed to remain under party control religious feeling boom with the number of believer in china topping 500 million by 2010 
> xi jinping's rise to power in late 2012 mark a new era the third in the history of the china communist party's religious policy 
> instead of the destruction of the mao years and the relatively laissezfaire approach of the reform period the state has embark on a form of highly curate revival 
> one part of its approach rest on a deep suspicion of christianity and islam 
> the party's policy toward islam has been the most draconian 
> some believer especially uighur in the northwestern province of xinjiang have been subject to a policy of forced secularize 
> this has included send hundred of thousand of muslim to reeducate camp compel restaurant to serve pork and alcohol and forbidding fast during ramadan 
> the policy toward christianity is more nuance 
> last year beije struck a deal with the vatican to joint appoint catholic bishop 
> the vatican seem to hope to reverse the decline in the number of catholic in china 
> but for beije the measure was a way to tighten control over the catholic clergy — and by extension the church itself 
> protestant pose an especially vex problem for the party 
> it is arguable china's fastestgrowe religion with an estimate 60 million or more adherent today compare with one million in 1949 including some 20 to 30 million who are thought to worship in unregistered or underground protestant church 
> but the faith lack a unify structure that would allow for negotiation 
> and so the government has fire a few shot across the bow close several of the country's bestknown underground church 
> in many ways however the xi administration's embrace of traditional faith is more radical 
> since taking office the president has met with buddhist leader and his government has allow taoism to flourish 
> the state recently issue a landmark plan to improve social mores the first such program since 2001 
> the plan stem from a widespread feeling that china's relentless drive to get ahead economically has create a spiritual vacuum and sometimes justify break rule and trample civility 
> many people do not trust one another 
> the government's blueprint for handle this moral crisis call for endorse certain traditional belief 
> the epic paper — it runs to 10000 china character and would be significant long translate into english — doesn't mention communist china's found father mao zedong or his successor and their ideology focus instead on mr xi and his effort to fix social problem like money worship and hedonism 
> it do invoke communist slogan such as core socialist value but in contrast to the previous such document from 2001 — which made only passing reference to china tradition — it call the past a rich source of morality 
> the plan orders party official to promote ancient and worthy sage as well as to deep expound traditional concept such as ren'ai benevolence zhengyi righteous and jianyi zhengwei standing up brave for the truth 
> this effort is not an attempt to replace communism with confucianism 
> yet it is fair to say that for the first time since china's imperial order collapse in 1911 a central government is embrace the idea that made up the politicalreligious order that ran china for much of the past 2500 years 
> why 
> not only to address china's moral vacuum but also as a populist measure 
> the country is enter a more uncertain era of slow growth and rising inequality and beije is drape itself in the mantle of tradition to broaden its appeal 
> in do so the government seem to be assume that traditional china value and belief are easy to control than foreign religion and that support them will outweigh the costs of suppress islam and christianity

< while not perfect the approach is far better than simpli fork over more and more taxpay dollar and stick local govern with an evergrow tab as the state ha been do 
< to get new york’ medicaid program back on track the group will need to take a hard look at spend on nonmed servic like cook and bath for homebound new yorker 
< accord to the empir center new york’ medicaid spend on such person servic wa the highest in the countri 
< that may be becaus of a program that ha expand in recent year in which medicaid pay nonmed provid like famili member to care for client

< i get that thi democrat primari isn’t play out as anyon predict or in remot accord with the party’ imag of itself and with it prioriti 
< none of the top four candid — biden warren buttigieg and sander — is a person of color three of them are 70 or older and the billionair tom steyer and mike bloomberg are dip into their person fortun in their effort to gain ground

< i keep see on twitter and facebook lament about harris’ fate from democrat who chose to support candid other than her 
< well she couldn’t succeed on gener ambient good will 
< i also keep see and hear statement along the line that the parti should be asham of the way thing are turn out that the parti fail 
< while an offici parti entiti the democrat nation committe inde set criteria for the debat — which had to have some criteria — there’ otherwis no committe of elder or secret cabal that decre which candid prosper and which don’t

< so if the parti is fellow democrat politician of note it’ hardli drive the direct of thi contest 
< we in the media aren’t drive it either though there’ constant carp along those line 
< we’v alway been fundament respons bestow coverag base on establish interest and we’r more respons than ever in thi digit age of sophist realtim measur of precis what our audienc doe and doesn’t turn to 
< we give you a tide of warren in part becaus you thrill to the earlier trickl

< ye mani democrat voter tell pollster that choos the candid most like to beat trump is their top concern

< governor are frequent tout as the best candid and they account for four of the past seven presid 
< if elect rule the day would biden’ stiffest competit be come from a 78yearold democrat socialist who recent had a heart attack and just place first in a california poll a 70yearold former ivi leagu law professor whom trump delight in call pocahonta and the 37yearold gay mayor of a small indiana citi 
< there’ a lot to thi primari that’ more complic than meet the eye a lot that explod assumpt 
< accord to the poll so far voter aren’t drawn to candid whose demograph profil overlap with their 
< biden’ support from black democrat in a nation quinnipiac poll late last month wa more than eight time what harris’ or booker’ wa 
< he and sander do exponenti better among latino than julin castro doe 
< sander not buttigieg ha the advantag among democrat under the age of 35 
< and mani gay democrat have reject buttigieg as inadequ progress and even insuffici gay 
< so if ident group elect media bia and person wealth aren’t the secret to success what are 
< i think we’r learn yet again that there’ no tidi trusti formula 
< but broad name recognit among engag voter — which biden sander and to a lesser extent warren all had at the outset — is an enorm asset

> really though local government have limited say over how the program is run 
> most of that responsibility rest with the state 
> when it come to reduce medicaid costs that's where the focus should remain 
> the most promising effort so far is mr cuomo's medicaid redesign team a working group assign to find 25 billion in savings this year preserve benefit while slash waste 
> the governor use a similar task force to successful carry out costsave medicaid reform nearly a decade ago aid by the afford care act 
> the new group will be led by the same two men michael dowl the president and ceo 
> of northwell health and by dennis rivera the former head of 1199 seiu the powerhouse health care union 
> they are set to make their recommendation ahead of the april 1 budget deadline 
> it will be up to mr cuomo to ensure the public good is top of mind 
> the redesign group should issue a thorough report present its finding to the public and the legislature 
> right now it's not clear they plan to do so and that's a problem 
> while not perfect the approach is far better than simply fork over more and more taxpayer dollar and stick local government with an evergrowe tab as the state has been do 
> to get new york's medicaid program back on track the group will need to take a hard look at spend on nonmedic service like cooking and bathing for homebound new yorker 
> according to the empire center new york's medicaid spend on such personal service was the highest in the country 
> that may be because of a program that has expand in recent years in which medicaid pay nonmedic provider like family member to care for client 
> in 2016 personal spend in new york account for 40 percent of national medicaid spend for the category overall up from 23 percent in 2011 the empire center said 
> complicate matter is a politics dynamic friendly to the health care industry 
> in 2018 for example the greater new york hospital association gave more than 1 million in politics contribution to the state's democratic party 
> not long afterward the state increase medicaid reimbursement rate for the first time since 2008 cost the state an estimate 140 million per year 
> mr cuomo has deny that donation influence his policy decision and cuomo administration official said at the time that the increase was necessary and simply long overdue 
> health care expert disagree and say hospital revenue had already been on the rise 
> new york's medicaid bill is out of control 
> the first order of business is to understand more about why and to be honest with the public about what needs to be done about it 
> democrats' baffling 2020 mess by frank bruni dec 7 2019 kamala harris fold her tent and on that patch of ground many flimsy theory bloom 
> disappointed democrat grouse that you obviously had to be rich to compete in the 2020 race — because she was gone while two billionaire remain — and pointed to the potential allwhite undiverse lineup at the party's next debate as proof that the qualify criteria put too much of a premium on fundraise 
> but harris had made the cut for that debate 
> and she enter the presidential sweepstakes with a higher net worth 6 million according to forbes than bernie sander 25 million amy klobuchar 2 million or pete buttigieg 100000 who are still in the hunt and are among the six contender slate to be spar onstage on dec 19 
> what's more sander and another of the six elizabeth warren have raise bucket of money without courting plutocrat 
> many democrat blame the media for harris's demise 
> they have a point inasmuch as some news organization never had the kind of romance with her that they did with buttigieg and beto o'rourke two white men 
> i noted as much in a column last may point to o'rourke's placement on the cover of vanity fair and buttigieg's on the cover of time 
> but the media fell quick out of love with o'rourke and is pick buttigieg apart for his lack of support among africanamerican and his past employment as a mckinsey consultant 
> and harris was hardly ignore her initial campaign rally in oakland calif in january was cover live in its entirety on msnbc and cnn 
> that same month rachel maddow of msnbc told her in a facetoface interview i think there is a good chance that you are go to win the nomination 
> and after the democratic debate in june when harris stirring confront joe biden about his past opposition to federal mandate bus to integrate school she received a bonanza of media attention and rapturous review 
> i get that this democratic primary isn't play out as anyone predict or in remote accordance with the party's image of itself and with its priority 
> none of the top four candidate — biden warren buttigieg and sander — is a person of color three of them are 70 or old and the billionaire tom steyer and mike bloomberg are dip into their personal fortune in their effort to gain ground 
> for a party that celebrate diversity pitch itself to underdog and pride itself on being futureminde and youthoriente that's a freaky baffling turn of event 
> but some of the conclusion being drawn and complaint being raise don't fully hold water 
> take the fear about the nomination being purchase 
> without question running for office is too expensive 
> that dynamic can definitely favor candidate with lucrative connection 
> and candidate are forced — unless they're steyer or bloomberg — to devote ludicrous and possibly corrupt sum of time to politics panhandle 
> but at least at present neither steyer nor bloomberg is exactly barrel toward victory 
> and while cory book drew a connection between harris's departure and a process warp by wealth the link is tenuous 
> book whose campaign press on despite his failure to qualify for the december debate said of harris's withdrawal voter did not determine her destiny 
> actually they kind of did 
> they're the one who are or aren't excited enough about a candidacy to donate money and keep it alive 
> they're the one respond to pollster and by flag their preference determine which candidate take on the air of plausible that often generate the next round of donation 
> i keep seeing on twitter and facebook lament about harris's fate from democrat who chose to support candidate other than her 
> well she couldn't succeed on generalize ambient good will 
> i also keep seeing and hearing statement along the lines that the party should be ashamed of the way things are turning out that the party fail 
> while an official party entity the democratic national committee indeed set criteria for the debate — which had to have some criteria — there's otherwise no committee of elder or secret cabal that decree which candidate prosper and which don't 
> besides which as ere levitz observe in new york magazine harris boast the enthusiast support of hillary's donor network and supporter warm relations with obamaworld and the sympathies of a broad range of democratic lawmaker in the nation's largest state and beyond 
> levitz add that when harris end her campaign on tuesday she trail only biden in the website fivethirtyeight's tally of important endorse that book has more such endorse than sander who is far ahead of him and that klobuchar has more than buttigieg whom she distantly trail 
> so if the party is fellow democratic politician of note it's hardly driving the direction of this contest 
> we in the media aren't driving it either though there's constant carp along those lines 
> we've always been fundamentally responsive bestow coverage base on establish interest and we're more responsive than ever in this digitize age of sophisticated realtime measure of precisely what our audience do and doesn't turn to 
> we give you a tide of warren in part because you thrill to the early trickle 
> we serve you oodles of buttigieg because we've notice your appetite for it 
> another questionable assessment of this primary is that elect is crowd out candidate who don't fit some safe profile 
> yes many democratic voter tell pollster that choose the candidate most likely to beat trump is their top concern 
> yes there's evidence that such an impulse is leading some voter away from candidate of color 
> but if elect emphatically rule the day wouldn't at least one of the three current or former governor already gone from the race — john hickenlooper of colorado steve bullock of montana and jay inslee of washington — have fare better 
> governor are frequent tout as the best candidate and they account for four of the past seven president 
> if elect rule the day would biden's stiffest competition be coming from a 78yearold democratic socialist who recently had a heart attack and just placed first in a california poll a 70yearold former ivy league law professor whom trump delight in calling pocahonta and the 37yearold gay mayor of a small indiana city 
> there's a lot to this primary that's more complicated than meet the eye a lot that explode assumption 
> according to the polling so far voter aren't drawn to candidate whose demography profile overlap with theirs 
> biden's support from black democrat in a national quinnipiac poll late last month was more than eight times what harris's or booker's was 
> he and sander do exponential better among latino than juli�n castro do 
> sander not buttigieg has the advantage among democrat under the age of 35 
> and many gay democrat have reject buttigieg as inadequate progressive and even insufficient gay 
> so if identity group elect media bias and personal wealth aren't the secret to success what are 
> i think we're learning yet again that there's no tidy trusty formula 
> but broad name recognition among engaged voter — which biden sander and to a lesser extent warren all had at the outset — is an enormous asset 
> so are a sales pitch and brand like buttigieg's that are distinct from any other contender's 
> finally there's politics acumen 
> there's raw talent 
> the last democratic president barack obama had plenty of it 
> the next democratic president will too 
> devin nun is danielle steel by frank bruni nov 15 2019 i came to your house with a gun

> twenty years ago when i was a senior in college i was diagnose with a condition call achalasia a rare sometimes genetic swallow disorder that i was actually quite familiar with because when i was a kid my mother had it too 
> it began as a blind burning bolt of pain in the middle of my chest after eat 
> imagine heartburn after you've eaten something spicy but amp up to 11 as if the thing you'd eaten was a chain saw douse in ghost pepper 
> the pain would abate after a few minutes but it would come back again and again usually after i'd eaten a big meal 
> then it began to hurt during big meal then during every meal and soon anytime i'd try to swallow anything 
> for many people the condition is curable through surgery but for me that longago flash of pain turn out to be only the beginning of an allconsume chronic and often embarrass disability 
> over the last two decade though i've undergone dozen of invasion procedure and test taken a panoply of pill and had various parts of my digestive system remove or surgical rebuilt my symptom have only gotten more intense and more — how to put this delicate 
> — expansive 
> swallow food is now an arduous enough task that i have to get much of my nutrition through liquid as kanye once rap i drink a boost for breakfast an ensure for dessert 
> but it's no long just eat that's a pain it's what happen after too 
> from the nave to the chop my swallow problem has spawn a grossout comedy's worth of gi 
> complication 
> the ugly upshot is this at least once every day and sometimes many times i have to run to the restroom on a moment's notice and what happen to me there is best experienced alone in blissful unembarrass solitude 
> i tell you all this in order to establish my bona fide i know public bathroom 
> in my travels over the years i have assemble in my head a veritable michelin guide of private peaceful place to go 
> so trust me when i tell you that in the last few years better public bathroom have start to pop up everywhere 
> again and again in big city and small in red states and blue in airport hotel shop mall theater stadium offices and a range of other public venue i've been save by a bounty of better loo 
> more restroom are now explicit inclusive and accessible design for people who are physically disabled are gender nonconform are travel with children or are otherwise in need of special accommodation 
> for instance paruresi and parcopresi phobia that inhibit people from urinate or defecate in public restroom are real debilitate conditions that affect ten of million of people 
> one innovation that has been of particular use to me is the lock singleoccupance allgender restroom 
> a decade ago in most public place it was nigh impossible to find a private place to do your business 
> today these oneperson stalls are a rising trend across the country especially at airport and other large public facilities 
> in some place they're label all gender restroom in other they're call family bathroom in yet other sign welcome everyone with broad language like all person may use this restroom 
> whatever you call them they're a haven in a world marked by chaos and disorder 
> over the last few years when nature call sudden and panic set in i've had the fortune of finding a clean private place at among other location the guggenheim in new york the getty center in los angeles the mall of america a dozen airport at least and so so many starbuck 
> of course things still aren't perfect 
> i am a member of a racial minority but i'm a cisgender person of means and social privilege

> don't go to the office when you are sick 
> don't send your kid to school or day care when they are ill either 
> notice i didn't say anything about mask 
> have a mask with you as a precaution make sense if you are in the midst of an outbreak as i was when out report in the field during those month 
> but wearing it constant is another matter 
> i don a mask when visiting hospital where sar patient had been house 
> i wore it in the market where wild animal that were the suspect source of the outbreak were being butcher blood droplet flying 
> i wore it in crowded enclose space that i couldn't avoid like airplane and train as i traveled to city involved in the outbreak like guangzhou and hong kong 
> you never know if the guy cough and sneeze two row ahead of you is ill or just has an allergy 
> but outdoors infection don't spread well through the air 
> those photo of people walking down street in china wearing mask are dramatic but uninformed 
> and remember if a mask has perchance intercept virus that would have otherwise end up in your body then the mask is contaminate 
> so in theory to be protect maybe you should use a new one for each outing

> for anyone tempt to go out and buy the gold standard n95 respirator note that they are uncomfortable 
> breathing is more work

> on one long flight at the height of the outbreak on which my few fellow passenger were mostly epidemiologist try to solve the sar puzzle many of us including me wore our mask for the first couple of hour on the flight 
> then the food and beverage cart came 
> though virus spread through droplet in the air a big worry to me was always transmission via what doctor call fomite infect item 
> a virus get on a surface — a shoe or a doorknob or a tissue for example 
> you touch the surface and then next touch your face or rub your nose 
> it's a great way to acquire illness 
> so after walking in the animal market i remove my shoe careful and did not take them into the hotel room 
> and of course i wash my hand immediately 
> remember by all indication sar which kill about 10 percent of those infect was a deadly virus than the new coronaviru circulate now 
> so keep things in perspective 
> face with sar many foreigner chose to leave beije or at least to send their children back to the united states 
> our family stay kid included 
> we want them with us and didn't want them to miss school especially during what would be their final year in china 
> but equally important in making the decision was that the risk of get sar on an airplane or in the airport seem greater than being smart and careful while stay put in beije 
> and we were i stop taking my kid to indoor playground or crowded mall or delicious but dense packed neighborhood beije restaurant 
> out of an abundance of caution we cancel a family vacation to cambodia — though my fear was less about catching sar on the flight than that one of the kid would have a fever from an ear infection upon our return at a border screening and would be stuck in a prolonged quarantine in china 
> we instead took a vacation within china where we carry mask with us but didn't use them except on a short domestic flight 
> in time during the sar outbreak the government shut down theater and school in beije as it is do now in many china city because these virus are more easily transmit in such crowded place 
> but there was also a lot of irrational behavior enter a village on the way to a hike near the great wall our car was stop by local who had set up a roadblock to check the temperature of all passenger 
> they use an oral thermometer that was only minimal clean after each use 
> what a great way to spread a virus 
> the international school of beije where my children were student was one of the few in the capital — perhaps the only one — that stay open throughout the sar outbreak though the class were empty since so many kid had departed to their home country 
> it was a studied but brave move since a parent at the school had gotten sar at the very beginning of the outbreak on a flight back from hong kong 
> she recover fine but it was close to home and family were scared 
> the school institute a bunch of simple precautionary policy a stern note to parent remind them not to send a child to school who was sick and warning them that student would be screen for fever with ear thermometer at the school door 
> there was no share of food at lunch 
> the teacher led the kid in frequent hand washing throughout the day at classroom sink while singing a prolonged hand washing song to ensure they did more than a cursory pass under the faucet with water only 
> if a family left beije and came back the child would have to stay at home for an extend period before return to class to make sure they hadn't caught sar elsewhere 
> with those precaution in place i observe something of a public health miracle not only did no child get sar but it seem no student was sick with anything at all for month on end

< that way while he rest in peac it could give us some too 
< that belov hospit 
< it’ drive up health care cost by elisabeth rosenth sept 1 2019 as voter fume about the high cost of health care politician have been target two welldeserv villain pharmaceut compani whose price have risen more than inflat and insur who pay their execut million in salari while rais premium and deduct 
< but while the democrat presidenti candid have devot copiou airtim to debat health care mani of the country’ lead health polici expert have wonder whi they have given a total pass to arguabl a primari culprit behind runaway medic inflat america’ hospit 
< data show that hospit are by far the biggest cost in our 35 trillion health care system where spend is grow faster than gross domest product inflat and wage growth 
< spend on hospit repres 44 percent of person expens for the privat insur accord to rand 
< a report thi year from research at yale and other univers found that hospit price increas a whop 42 percent from 2007 to 2014 for inpati care and 25 percent for outpati care compar with 18 percent and 6 percent for physician 
< so whi have politician on both the left and right let hospit off scotfre 
< becaus a web of tie bind politician to the health care system 
< everi senat virtual everi congressman and everi mayor of everi larg citi ha a power hospit system in hi or her district 
< and those hospit are as polit untouch as soybean grower in iowa or oil produc in texa 
< as hospit and hospit system have consolid they have becom the biggest employ in numer citi and state 
< they have replac manufactur as the hometown industri in a number of rustbelt citi includ cleveland and pittsburgh 
< can kamala harri ignor the request of sutter health kaiser permanent ucla 
< or ani of the big health care system in california 
< can elizabeth warren ignor the need of partner healthcar boston’ behemoth 
< berni sander may be somewhat differ on thi front becaus vermont doesn’t have ani nation rank hospit 
< beyond that hospit are often belov by constitu 
< it’ easi to get voter rile up about a drug maker in silicon valley or an insur in hartford 
< it’ much riskier to tri to direct their venom at the place where their children were born that employ their parent as nurs doctor and orderli that sponsor local littl leagu team that wa associ with their cathol church 
< and of cours there’ elect money 
< hospit trade group medic center and their employe are major polit donor contribut to whichev parti hold power — and often to the outofpow parti as well 
< in 2018 pac associ with the greater new york hospit associ and individu link to it gave 45 million to the democrats’ senat major pac and 1 million to their hous major pac 
< it chief lobbyist person gave nearli a quarter of a million dollar to dozen of campaign last year 
< senat sander ha call on hi competitor for the democrat nomin to follow hi lead and reject contribut from pharma and insur 
< can ani candid do the same for hospit 
< the campaign committe of all 10 candid particip in the upcom democrat debat have plenti donat link to the hospit and health care industri accord to open secret 
< but the symbiosi between hospit and politician oper most insidi in the subtl fuel of each other’ interest 
< zack cooper a health economist at yale and hi colleagu look at thi life cycl of influenc by analyz how member of congress vote for a medicar provis that allow hospit to appli to have their govern payment increas 
< hospit in district of member who vote yea got more money than hospit whose repres vote nay to the collect tune of 100 million 
< they use that money to hire more staff and increas payrol 
< they also spent million lobbi to extend the program 
< member who vote yea in turn receiv a 25 percent increas in total campaign contribut and a 65 percent increas in contribut from individu work in the health care industri in their home state 
< it wa a winwin for both side 
< to defend their high price medic center assert that they couldn’t afford to oper on medicar payment which are gener lower than what privat insur pay 
< but the argument isn’t convinc 
< the cost of a hospit stay in the unit state averag 5220 a day in 2015 — and could be as high as over 17000 compar with 765 in australia 
< in a rand studi publish earlier thi year research calcul that hospit treat patient with privat health insur were paid overal 24 time the medicar rate in 2017 and nearli three time the rate for outpati care 
< if the plan had paid accord to medicare’ formula their spend would be reduc by over half 
< most economist think hospit could do just fine with far less than they get today from privat insur 
< while on paper mani hospit oper on the thinnest of margin that is in part a choic result from extravag 
< it would be unseemli for these nonprofit medic center to make barrel of money 
< so when their oper gener huge surplus — as mani big medic center do — they plow the money back into the system 
< they build anoth cancer clinic increas ceo 
< pay buy the newest scanner whether it is need or not or instal spa and zen garden 
< some rural hospit are genuin struggl 
< but mani american hospit have been spend capit like water said kevin schulman a physicianeconomist at stanford 
< the high cost of hospit today he said is often a function of the cost of new infrastructur or poor manag decis 
< medicar is suppos to pay the cost of an effici hospit he said 
< if they’v made bad decis whi should we keep pay for that 
< if hospit were paid less via regul or genuin competit they would look differ and they’d make differ purchas decis about technolog 
< but would that matter to medic result 
< compar with their european counterpart some american hospit resembl sevenstar hotel 
< and yet on averag the unit state doesn’t have better outcom than other wealthi nation 
< by some measur — such as life expect and infant mortal — it score wors than averag 
< as attorney gener in california kamala harri in 2012 initi an antitrust investig into hospitals’ high charg 
< but as a senat and presidenti candid she ha been larg silent on the issu — as have all the other candid 
< as uwe reinhardt the rever princeton health economist who die in 2017 told me if you want to save money you have to pay less 
< that mean take on hospit price 
< so fine go after drug maker and insur 
< and for good measur attack the devic maker who profit from huge markup and the pharmaci benefit manag — the middlemen who negoti drug price down for insur then keep the differ for themselv 
< but with congress return to washington in the come day and a new democrat debat less than two week away our elect offici need to address the eleph in the room and tell us how they plan to rein in hospit excess

< when you put all these factor togeth you’v got a danger recip for global repress

< the govern ha impos a travel lockdown on more than 35 million peopl which expert say is a quarantin of unpreced size and scale yet it may not even turn out to be veri effect 
< expert say that quarantin work best dure the earliest stage of an outbreak but that they can also backfir caus medic shortag corrod trust in health offici and push some peopl to look to evad care to escap ani restrict on their right 
< china took week to mount a fullscal respons to the viru 
< accord to wuhan’ mayor five million peopl left the citi befor restrict were impos suggest the countri is effect lock the barn door after the hors ha run off 
< they’r do it becaus peopl who are in polit leadership alway think that if you do someth dramat and visibl that you’ll gain popular support lawrenc o gostin a professor of global health law at georgetown univers told the washington post 
< they couldn’t have ani sound public health advic 
< we should keep thi sens of caution in mind in case american politician begin push for travel ban overbroad quarantin or other measur that might not be support by the scienc 
< you might wonder what the great harm is — if the govern need to temporarili limit people’ movement or prevent some peopl from enter the countri shouldn’t it take those measur in the face of danger ill 
< perhap but given the checker histori of quarantin — throughout histori they have been use to persecut the margin — lawmak and the media should rigor examin the base for ani such restrict 
< we should especi make sure ani restrict impos are inde temporari and adher to the scienc — someth we don’t alway do 
< consid that 30 year after the aid outbreak men who have sex with men are still restrict from donat blood in the unit state long after the scientif basi for such a ban ha pass

> in a rand study publish early this year research calculate that hospital treat patient with private health insurance were paid overall 24 times the medicare rate in 2017 and nearly three times the rate for outpatient care 
> if the plan had paid according to medicare's formula their spend would be reduce by over half 
> most economist think hospital could do just fine with far less than they get today from private insurance

> as the world health organization declared last week it remains too early to call the outbreak a global public health emergency 
> so far the wuhan coronaviru is not much more frighten than the outbreak of other recent coronaviruse like sar in 2003 or mer in 2012 each of which kill few than a thousand people around the world 
> the new virus's death toll has just exceed 130 for context according to the cdc about 15 million america have been sicken by the seasonal flu so far in the 20192020 flu season and 8200 have die from it 
> the flu kill between 300000 and 650000 people around the world annual 
> what worry me more than the new disease is that fear of a vague and terrify new illness might spiral into panic and that it might be use to justify unnecessary severe limit on movement and on civil liberties especially of racial and religious minority around the world 
> i also worry that the online world may give rise to dangerous skepticism and that in the event of an actual pandemic a large number of people may delay treatment or refuse vaccine because they don't believe the science or are suspicious of the government

> tech giant have been racing to tamp down conspiracy theory and hoax about the wuhan virus but i worry that their effort won't be very successful because society seem to have no good answer to the kind of emotional contagion dr larson describe 
> it's not just that many people get their news from a medium given to rumor exaggeration and wild misinform especially on issue about health or science — see the persistence of antivaxer or climatechange denier 
> there is also a grow partisan divide over how america interpret scientific expertise and health policy leave decision about public health vulnerable to the kind of partisan squabble you hear on cable news every night

> from donald trump to xi jinp to boris johnson strongmen with authoritarian tendency run many of the world's most powerful government 
> it is worth remember that disease or the fear of disease can bring out the worst in humanity — pandemic often feed scapegoat jew were widely blame for the black death create a fertile field for demagogue 
> when you put all these factor together you've got a dangerous recipe for global repression 
> already china's response appear to be driven by politics consideration more than epidemiologic one 
> the government has impose a travel lockdown on more than 35 million people which expert say is a quarantine of unprecedented size and scale yet it may not even turn out to be very effective 
> expert say that quarantine work best during the earliest stage of an outbreak but that they can also backfire cause medical shortage corrode trust in health official and push some people to look to evade care to escape any restriction on their rights 
> china took week to mount a fullscale response to the virus 
> according to wuhan's mayor five million people left the city before restriction were impose suggest the country is effectively lock the barn door after the horse has run off 
> they're do it because people who are in politics leadership always think that if you do something dramatic and visible that you'll gain popular support lawrence o gostin a professor of global health law at georgetown university told the washington post 
> they couldn't have any sound public health advice 
> we should keep this sense of caution in mind in case america politician begin push for travel ban overbroad quarantine or other measure that might not be support by the science 
> you might wonder what the great harm is — if the government needs to temporary limit people's movements or prevent some people from enter the country shouldn't it take those measure in the face of dangerous illness 
> perhaps but given the checker history of quarantine — throughout history they have been use to persecute the marginal — lawmaker and the media should rigorous examine the bases for any such restriction 
> we should especially make sure any restriction impose are indeed temporary and adhere to the science — something we don't always do 
> consider that 30 years after the aids outbreak men who have sex with men are still restricted from donate blood in the united states long after the scientific basis for such a ban has pass 
> so far president trump has offer a measured response to the virus 
> we have it total under control he said this week 
> but online misinform about the scale of the virus is already trend 
> it is not as you might have read on twitter thermonuclear pandemic level bad 
> so are racist meme blame china people and china culture for the virus 
> i fear that the conditions are ripe for a situation similar to what occur in the summer of 2014 when an outbreak of ebola overran west africa 
> after the obama administration scramble to bring home two america health worker who had become infect with the disease in liberia trump went on a monthslong twitter tirade about ebola

> people that go to far away place to help out are greatbut must suffer the consequence

< anoth fear is that etho will cave to pressur from foreign govern about which organ should and should not be allow to own org domain 
< current org is an open domain so anyon is allow to regist a org domain and there are more than 10 million of them regist worldwid 
< but the public internet registri ha the author to suspend domain name for illeg activ and one of the concern rais in a public letter oppos the sale is the potenti for govern to target ngo by accus them of illeg activ and pressur the public internet registri to take down their domain 
< just last month for instanc the chines govern sanction five unit statesheadquart ngo for their involv in the protest in hong kong all five of those ngo have org domain 
< there are other reason to be worri about the sale

< but while icann say it ha ask pir for more inform about the sale it ha told the public veri littl about those inquiri or the ensu respons and it ha not solicit ani public comment on the transact 
< icann’ reason seem to be that sinc the sale doe not threaten the secur reliabl or stabil of the org domain it is not it place to interven 
< but icann regularli make decis about domain ownership that are unrel to issu of secur and stabil — just last year for instanc it grant amazon ownership of the amazon toplevel domain over the object of sever south american countri

< odd are that seven year later you’v still never interact with a websit end in one of those domain and if you have it wa probabl onli a mean of deliv spam or malwar to your comput 
< today icann is in a veri delic posit becaus it deriv it author not from a contract with the unit state but instead from it abil to balanc the interest of all it variou stakehold from govern offici to civil societi group and forprofit compani and maintain credibl with the worldwid commun 
< it’ easi to see whi it is not eager to jump into the fray and interfer with or even question the etho deal for fear of draw critic

> your brain and body begin to shut down 
> according to porges's polyvagal theory the concept of safety is fundamental to our mental state 
> people who have experienced trauma have body that are highly reactive to perceive threat 
> they don't like public place with loud noise 
> they live in fightorflight mode stress and anxious 
> or if they feel trap and constrained they go numb 
> their voice and tone go flat 
> physical reaction shape our way of seeing and being 
> lisa feldman barrett of northeastern university also argue that a main purpose of the brain is to read the body and to regulate what she call the body budget 
> you may see a bully on the playground 
> your brain then predict your next action and speed your heart rate and breathing to deal with it 
> you experience these change as emotion — oh this is fear or oh this is anger — because your brain has create an emotion concept to make those physical change meaningful 
> you might think that in everyday life the things you see and hear influence what you feel but it's mostly the other way around what you feel alter your sight and hearing barrett write in how emotion are made 
> when we're really young we know few emotion concept 
> young children say mommy i hate you 
> when they mean i don't like this because they haven't learned their culture's concept for hatred vs bad 
> but as we get old we learn more emotional granular 
> the emotionally wise person can create distinct experience of disappointment anger spite resentment grouchy and aggravation whereas for a less emotionally wise person those are all synonym for i feel bad 
> a wise person may know the foreign words that express emotion we can't name in english tocka russia roughly for spiritual anguish or litost czech roughly for misery combine with the hunger for revenge 
> people with high emotional granular respond flexible to life have better mental health outcome and drink less 
> if bodily reaction can drive people apart they can also heal 
> martha g welch of columbia university points to the importance of loving physical touch especially in the first 1000 minutes of life to lay down marker of emotional stability 
> under the old brainon paradigm welch argue we told people to selfregulate their emotion through conscious selftalk 
> but real emotional help come through coregulation 
> when a mother and a child physically hold each other their bodily autonomy states harmonize connect on a metabolic level 
> together they move from separate distress to mutual calm 
> welch has create something call the welch emotional connection screen which measure the emotional connection between mother and preterm baby 
> by encourage this kind of deep visceral connection through 18 month her therapy can mitigate the effects of autism 
> when you step back and see the brain and body thinking together the old distinction between reason and emotion doesn't seem to make sense 
> your very perception of the world is shaped by the prediction your brain is making about your physical autonomy states 
> you also see how important it is to teach emotional granular something our culture pay almost no attention to 
> you also see that we're not separate brains cool observing each other 
> we're physical viscera deep interact with each other 
> the important communication is happening at a much deep level 
> trump has made us all stupid by david brook donald trump is impulsedriven ignorant narcissistic and intellectual dishonest 
> so you'd think that those of us in the antitrump camp would go out of our way to show we're not like him — that we are judicious informed mature and reasonable 
> but the event of the past week have shown that the antitrump echo chamber is becoming a mirror image of trump himself — overwrought uncalibrated and incapable of have an intelligent conversation about any complex policy problem 
> for example there's a complex policy problem at the heart of this week's iran episode 
> iran is not powerful because it has a strong economy or military 
> it is powerful because it sponsor militia across the middle east destabilize regime and spread genocide and sectarian cleanse 
> over the past few years those militia orchestrate by qassim suleimani have felt free to operate more in the open with greater destructive effect 
> we're not go to go in and destroy the militia 
> so how can we keep them in check so they don't destabilize the region 
> that's the hard problem — one that stymie past administration 
> in the middle east and wherever there are protract conflict nation have a way to address this problem 
> they use violence as a form of communication 
> a nation try to maintain order will assassinate a terrorism leader or destroy a terrorism facility 
> the attack say hey we know we're in a longterm conflict but let's not let it get out of hand 
> that's not in either of our interests 
> the attack is a way to seize control of the escalate process and set a boundary marker 
> these sort of operation have risk and rewards 
> a risk is that it won't cease the escalate just accelerate it 
> the radical on the other side will get enrage and take to the street 
> their leader will have to appease that rage 
> a reward is that maybe you do halt the escalate 
> the other side implicit say message received 
> we'll do some facesave things to appease the street but we don't want this to get out of hand either 
> another reward is that you've manage to eliminate an effective terrorist like suleimani 
> talent doesn't grow on tree 
> the decision to undertake this sort of operation is a matter of weigh risk and reward 
> and after the suleimani killing you saw america security professional talk in the language of balance risk and reward 
> stanley mcchrystal a retired general and michael mullen a retired admiral thought it was worth the risk 
> susan rice a former national security adviser thought it wasn't 
> but in the antitrump echo chamber that's not how most people were thinking 
> led by bernie sander and elizabeth warren they avoid the hard complex problem of how to set boundary around militia 
> instead they pontificate on the easy question not actually on the table should we have a massive invasion of iran 
> a great cry went up from the echo chamber 
> we're on the brink of war 
> trump is leading us to more endless war in the middle east 
> we're on the precipice of total chaos 
> this was not the calibrate language of risk and reward 
> it was fearstoke apocalyptic language 
> by being so overwrought and exaggerate the echo chamber drown out any practical conversation about how to stabilize the middle east so we could have another righteous chorus of donald trump is a monster 
> this is trump's ultimate victory 
> every argument on every topic is now all about him 
> hate trump together has become the ultimate bond attentiongrabb and profitmaximize mechanism for those of us in antitrump world

> in those conflict america's overwhelming military might stumble on local culture geography ethnic and religious rivalry and most of all the determination of an entrenched committed foe that could melt in and out of the local population 
> as vox's alex ward points out iran has almost three times as many people as iraq did when we invade in 2003 
> it also has treacherous geography and it control a great many proxy forces across the middle east and even in likely sleeper cell in europe and latin america 
> iran also possess a sophisticated cyberwar operation — it is believe to be behind recent hack into america bank and other target and to have spread disinformation and propaganda on social network around the world 
> the united states would overwhelm iran in a conventional headon war but like china and russia iran has adopt a deep capacity to mount hybrid war — conflict that involve both conventional and unconventional means of war 
> for example iran could expand its operation on oil tanker in the strait of hormuz dealing a costly rise in global energy price

> this get to the immense folly at the heart of our military might 
> though the united states spend more on the military than the next nine country combine we have not been able to purchase much peace through strength 
> that's because our strength is clearly of a type and our years in iraq and afghanistan have made plain our vulnerable 
> among other shortcoming our military is still buy mostly big old defense technology like aircraft carrier and bomber from the militaryindustrial complex even if many of these technology face obsolescence under a future of artificial intelligence unmann battlefield robot and other cyberweapon 
> our country's effort at adopt artificial intelligence technology in the military might not be enough to counter our rival including russia and china 
> the upshot is this the united states hold military supremacy over the world's waters and the airspace but our control is limited and contest
