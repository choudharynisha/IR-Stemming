foreword 

of all subject that have at ani time engag the attent of the 

world, there is none more ancient than astrology. in the east—wher it 

first aros at a period of veri remot antiquity—it still hold sway 

and in everi part of the world (especi among the learned) it 

reign suprem until the middl of the seventeenth century. that it 

not onli rule the daili action of individu but sway the council 

of princes, is shown by the record of everi nation that has a histori 

(and by none more fulli than by that of england); yet the present 

generat seem never, until quit lately, to have care to inquir on 

what basi this belief could have been for so mani age supported. 

dure the past ten years, however—poss from a reaction grow 

out of the realism by which we have been so long oppressed—a new 

interest in these old-world belief has sprung up and it is to satisfi 

that interest that this book (contain the result of mani year 

study) was written. 

chirom and physiognomi are both base on astrolog and are, 

therefore, quit in place as the second and third part of a work 

treat of the influenc of the stars. mani of the modern writer on 

chirom seem dispos to deni it affin to astrology, with which 

it is, however, insepar connected. dr. saunders, in the prefac to 

his exhaust work on chirom and physiognomy, publish in 1671, 

and dedic to his friend lilly, the great astrologer, says: "for our 

more order proceed with the bodi of this work, it is in the first 

place necessari to be observ that there are seven planets, name 

stellæ errantes—wand stars—which have each of them it 

separ charact as they are use in astrologie; the which star have 

great power over inferior bodi and do, each of them, govern some part 

or other of man bodi and they especi have their materi 

exist in the hand and without astrolog chirom could not 

subsist and be subservi to true wisdom." 

now, why, in the face of this and mani other equal forcibl word 

among the old-world authorities, do the modern writer tri to forc 

their own crude theori upon us? to drag the time-honour studi of 

chirom into the turmoil of nineteenth-centuri exist and—bi 

rob it of it mysticism—to strain it into unison with the realism 

of modern thought, strike the earnest student with the same sens of 

incongru as would the hang of a carniv mask over the mystic 

calm featur of an antiqu statue.
