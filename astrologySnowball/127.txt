your handwrit reveal 

your charact 

your handwrit is you; disguis it as you will, it still reveal your character. 

as a matter of fact, it is a sheer imposs for an ordinari person 

to alter his or her write completely. the natur hand and the purposely-chang 

hand will bear sever resemblances, howev hard the individu 

may tri to make them dissimilar. this is due to the fact that the same 

charact lie behind both efforts. not onli is your handwrit you, but 

the handwrit of your friend is "him or her." this be so, you will 

find it a simpl matter to arriv at his or her qualiti by analyz a few 

line of the person handwriting. to becom suffici expert for this, 

you will not need more than half-an-hour study. 

first of all we must attend to the direct of the line of writing, as, 

should these be level, a normal and calm state of mind is shown, general 

reliable, and not subject to change. 

when the line slope toward the right, much energi is indicated; when 

the line slope downward, a lack of energi is shown, usual from depress 

which may result from ill health. 

if the write slope upward with excess, it show recklessness; if downwards, 

with a veri slope inclination, it show mental depress verg 

almost on loss of reason. 

if the signatur slope upwards, then we may expect to find person 

ambition, but if downwards, some physic weakness. if instead of the 

whole line ascend onli word here and there will ascend, this indic 

"hope," but if scatter word ascend and descend in the same line, we may 

read a lack of tenac in emotions. 

secondly.—th line form the letter may appear:— 

(a) practic upright; or 

(b) slope slight to the right. 

(c) slope veri much to the right as if each letter were fall 

over the rest. 

(d) slope to the left, and lastly, 

(e) "back-hand writing." 

between a and b might be call normal. 

a show pluck and self-possession, and, if pointed, mathematics. 

b tenderness, but should the write be pointed, a quick, acut mind, 

with no sympathi with sentiment. 

c show indolence; if with point letters, mental power, but should 

the letter be rounded, mental and physic indolence.

e look peculiar and indic self-consciousness, and, as a rule, hidden 

sentimentality. 

thirdly.—th write small and pointed, we get curiosity; if medium 

in size, and gradual increas toward the end of the line, it show an 

outspoken nature; should the write diminish toward the end of the line

petti of nature, fussi over unimport details.

and ignor more import things. 

light and fine write mean delicaci of feeling, but if carri to excess

fourthly.—th connect of the letter with each other must be 

judged. if the connect stroke is long, it show some facil in talk

separate, we get percept and intuition.
