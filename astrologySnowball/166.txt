astronom lore in chaucer 



i 

astronomi in the middl age 

the conspicu of astronom lore in the poetri of chaucer is due 

to it import in the life of his century. in the mediaev period, 

astronomi (or astrology, for the two name were use indiffer to 

cover the same subject) was one of the vital interest of men. the 

ordinari man of the middl age knew much more than do most men to-day 

about the phenomena of the heavens; conveni such as clocks, almanacs, 

and chart repres celesti phenomena were rare, and direct 

observ of the appar movement and the relat posit of the 

heaven bodi were necessari for the regul of man daili 

occupations. furthermore, the belief in a geocentr system of the 

universe, which in chaucer centuri was almost univers accepted, was 

of vast signific in man way of thinking. accept this view, all 

the heaven bodi seem to have been creat for the sole benefit of 

man, inhabit the central posit in the universe; their movements, 

alway with refer to the earth as a center, brought to man light, 

heat, chang of season—al the condit that made human life possibl 

on the earth. 

not onli did the man of the middl age see in the regular movement of 

the celesti sphere the instrument by which god grant him physic 

existence, but in the various aspect of heaven phenomena he saw the 

govern principl of his moral life. the arrang of the heaven 

bodi with regard to one anoth at various time was suppos to exert 

undoubt power over the cours of terrestri events. each planet was 

thought to have special attribut and a special influenc over men's[pg 4] 

lives. venus was the planet of love, mars, of war and hostility, the sun, 

of power and honor, and so forth. each was mysteri connect with a 

certain color, with a metal, too, the alchemist said, and each had 

special power over some organ of the human body. the planet influenc 

was believ to vari great accord to it posit in the heavens, so 

that to determin a man destini accur it was necessari to consid 

the aspect of the whole heavens, especi at the moment of his birth, 

but also at other times. this was call “cast the horoscope” and was 

regard as of great import in enabl a man to guard against 

threaten peril or bad tendencies, and to make the best use of 

favor opportunities. 

it is not astonishing, then, that the great monument of literatur in the 

mediaev period and even much later are fill with astronom and 

astrolog allusions; for these are but reflect of vital human 

interest of the times. the greatest poetic work of the middl ages, 

dant divina commedia, is rich in astronom lore, and it dramat 

action is project against a cosmograph background reflect the 

view of dant contemporari as to the structur of the world. milton, 

write in the seventeenth century, base the cosmolog of his paradis 

lost in the main on the ptolema system, but make adam and the 

archangel raphael discuss the relat merit of this system and the 

heliocentr view of the universe. the latter had been brought forth by 

copernicus a centuri earlier, but even in milton day had not yet 

succeed in supplant the old geocentr cosmology. 

the view of the univers which we find reflect in chaucer poetri is 

chiefli base on the ptolema system of astronomy, though it show trace 

of veri much more primit cosmolog ideas. the ptolema system owe 

it name to the famous alexandrian astronom of the second centuri a. d., 

claudius ptolemy, but is base larg on the work and discoveri of the 

earlier greek philosoph and astronomers, especi eudoxus, 

hipparchus, and aristarchus, whose investig ptolemi compiled[pg 5] and, 

along some lines, extended. ptolema astronomi was a pure geometr 

or mathemat system which repres the observ movement and 

relat posit of the heaven bodi so accur that calcul 

as to their posit at ani given time could be base upon it. ptolemi 

agre with his contemporari in the opinion that to assign caus for 

the celesti movement was outsid the sphere of the astronomer. this was 

a proper field of philosophy; and the decis of philosophers, 

especi those of aristotle, were regard as final, and their teach 

as the basi upon which observ phenomena should be described. 

accord to the ptolema system the earth is a motionless sphere fix 

at the center of the universe. it can have no motion, for there must be 

some fix point in the univers to which all the motion of the heaven 

bodi may be referred; if the earth had motion, it was argued, this would 

be proportion to the great mass of the earth and would caus object 

and anim to fli off into the air and be left behind. ptolemi believ 

this reason suffici to make unten the idea of a rotatori motion of 

the earth, although he was fulli awar that to suppos such a motion of 

the earth would simplifi exceed the represent of the celesti 

movements. it did not occur to him that to suppos the earth atmospher 

to particip in it motion would obviat this difficulty. the earth was 

but a point in comparison with the immens sphere to which the star were 

attach and which revolv about the earth onc in everi twenty-four 

hours, impart it motion to sun, moon, and planets, thus caus day 

and night and the rise and set of the heaven bodies. the irregular 

motion of the planet were account for by suppos them to move on 

circl of small sphere call epicycles', the centr of which move 

around the deferents', or circl of larg sphere which carri the 

planet in cours concentr to the star sphere. by give each of the 

planet an epicycl and defer of the proper relat size and veloc 

the vari oscil of the planets, as far as they could be follow 

by mean of the simpl instrument then in use, were almost perfect 

account for. 

[pg 6]though it was a pure mathemat system which onli attempt to give a 

basi for comput celesti motions, ptolema astronomi is of great 

import histor as it remain the foundat of theoret 

astronomi for more than 1400 years. throughout the long dark centuri of 

the middl age it surviv in the studi of the retir student of the 

monasteri and of the few except enlighten men who still had 

some regard for pagan learn in the day when mani of the church father 

denounc it as heretical. 

ptolemi was the last of the great origin greek astronomers. the 

alexandrian school produced, after him, onli copyist and commentators, 

and the theoret astronomi of the greeks, so high perfect in 

ptolemi almagest, was for mani centuri almost entir neglected. 

the roman state gave no encourag to the studi of theoret 

astronomi and produc no new school of astronomy. although it was the 

fashion for a roman to have a smatter of greek astronomy, and famous 

latin author like cicero, seneca, strabo and plini wrote on astronomy, 

yet the roman care littl for origin investig and contribut 

noth new to the science. the romans, however, appreci the valu of 

astronomi in measur time, and appli to the alexandrian school to 

satisfi their practic need for a calendar. what julius caesar obtain 

from the alexandrian sosigenes, he great improv and gave to the 

empire, as the calendar which, with the except of the slight chang 

made by gregori xiii, we still use. 

the pseudo-astronom scienc of astrology, or the so-cal judici 

astronomi was pursu dure the roman empir and throughout the middl 

age with much greater zeal than theoret astronomy. the interest in 

astrology, to be sure, encourag the studi of observ astronomi to 

a certain extent; for the cast of horoscop to foretel destini 

requir that the heaven bodi be observ and method of calcul 

their posit at ani time or place be known. but there was no desir to 

inquir into the under law of the celesti motion or to 

investig the real natur of the heaven phenomena. 

[pg 7]if the roman state did not encourag astronomy, the roman church 

posit discourag it. the bibl becam and long remain the sole 

author recogn by the church father as to the constitut of the 

universe. by mani of the patrist ptolema astronomi was despised; not 

becaus it did not describ accur the observ phenomena of the 

heavens, for it did this in a way that could scarc have been improv 

upon with the facil for observ then available; and not becaus 

it was found upon the fals assumpt that the earth is the motionless 

center of the univers about which all heaven bodi revolve; but 

becaus there was no author in scriptur for such a system, and it 

could not possibl be made consist with the cosmolog of genesis. 

allegor descript of the univers base on the scriptur held 

almost complet sway over the mediaev mind. the whole univers was 

repres allegor by the tabernacl and it furniture. the earth 

was flat and rectangular like the tabl of shew bread, and surround on 

all four side by the ocean. the wall of heaven beyond this support the 

firmament shape like a half-cylinder. angel move the sun, moon, and 

star across the firmament and let down rain through it window from the 

expans of water above.
