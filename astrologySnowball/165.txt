india toward the begin of th

scription of the planetari deiti w

gods, but also their characters. in

born under it influenc as well as t 
in a previous articl i have shown 
hora and drekäna is deriv fro 
decan ;8 it is possibl to demonstrat 
character of the planet and 
is, however, this difference. whe 
hora and drekäna are essenti

deriv from illustr at all. t 
supposit is that the planet are

peculiar is the portray of ven 
this may either be due to their ide 
indian mythology, or to the fact t

as was true in the case of the descr

but it is clear that similar descript were transmit by a second 
translat from the greek which was util in the now lost astrolog 
poem of satya (second or third century); satya vers are reflect in 
the vrddhayavanajâtaka11 of mînarâja (fourth century), and in the 
laghujätaka12 and brhajjâtaka13 of varähamihira (sixth century). but 
varähamihira has also use the yavanajâtaka, as has pseudo-prthuyasas, 
who claim to be varähamihira son, in the horâsâra.1* pseudo 
paräsara (seventh or eighth century) has copi from the brhajjâtaka in 
the pürvakhanda of his brhatpäräsarahoräsästra,15 while kalyänavarman 
(c. a.d. 800) has use both the yavanajâtaka and the brhajjâtaka in the 
relev vers of the särävali,16 an anonym author cite by sivaräja 
(fifteenth century) in his jyotirnibandha17 and mantresvara (sixteenth 
century) in the phaladîpikâ18 reli on kalyänavarman, while gunäkara 
(fourteenth century?) in his horâmakaranda19 depend on both the 
brhajjâtaka and the sârâvalï. less import character of the 
planet can be found in the täjika20 of nilakantha (who finish the 
varsatantra in 1587) and the jâtakâbharana21 of dhundhiräja (who wrote 
in 1628). 
the most obvious dissimilar between sphujidhvaja s vers and 
those of the later indian astrolog lie in the order of the planets. 
by the fourth centuri in india it had becom an unbreak rule that 
the planet must be name in the order of their lordship of the week 
days: sun, moon, mars, mercury, jupiter, venus, and saturn. sphujidh 
vaja was earli enough to escap this law, and here arrang the planet

a.d. 1040/1041),29 and an unknown byzantin author.30 
relat to this dorothean tradit are passag in ptolemi (second 
century) tetrabiblo on the influenc of the five star-planet on the bodies31 
and souls32 of nativ and in firmicus maternus (fl. 334-337) ma thesis.'m 
both of these, however, contain addit to dorotheus text, some of 
which are parallel in the yavanajätaka. some of these addit are 
also found attribut to pythagora in some greek manuscripts,34 and 
in other they are incorpor in a longer treatis which pretend to be 
deriv from an egyptian source.35 this "pythagorean" or "egyptian" 
text was combin with hephaestio quotat from dorotheus by 
rhetorius of egypt (ear sixth century).36 outsid of both these tradi 
tions, but to some extent similar to the "pythagorean", are two short 
documents, one ascrib to an unknown anatolius,37 the other tentat 
(and undoubt wrongly) to heliodorus.38 
finally, one must mention the planetari iconographi in the templ of 
the "säbians" of harrän known from sever descript in arab 
sources,39 as it was thought by saxl to preserv an ancient babylonian 
tradition.40 with this can also be compar the descript of the 
planetari imag of the "sipasians" in the dabistàn of moshan fäni.41

who were associ with the planet 
describ as have been in harrä 
hellenist character of the nativ born under the influenc of 
the planet are in part borrow from babylonian astrology, but we are 
not yet in a posit to determin the extent of this influence. sure 
mani particular of the imag suppos erect by the "säbians" and 
"sipasians" and those describ elsewher in islam sourc are deriv 
from the indian tradit investig in this paper. 
in the follow page i give the more import sanskrit text and 
translat thereof. the word underlin with a solid line in the 
vrddhayavanajdtaka, brhajjdtaka, laghujätaka, and särävali correspond 
to word in the yavanajdtaka; those italic repres idea similar to 
those in the yavanajdtaka. in an appendix i list the parallel to the adjec 
tive of sphujidhvaja and satya which i have found in the hellenist 
character of the nativ born under the influenc of each planet. 
the planetari melothesia and dosa which appear in these text will be 
discuss in detail in my edit of the yavanajdtaka.
