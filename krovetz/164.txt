summary.-astrology, as presently practiced (in either its tradiuonal or psycho- 
logical form), has no relevance to understanding ourselves or our place in the cosmos. 
modern advocate of astrology cannot account for the underlying basis of astrology 
association with terrestrial affairs, have no plausible explanation for its claims, and 
have not contribute anything of cognitive value to any field of the social sciences. 
further, astrology do not have the theoretical or conceptual resources to resolve its 
own internal problem adequate or external anomaly or to adjudicate among con- 
flict astrology claim or systems. 

the initial assumption of scientist and astrologer were not so very different until quite re- 
cently. some astrologers, however, fear that science was catching up to them, have back- 
track very rapidly, c r e a h g a smokescreen of symbolism, inner reality, holistic understanding, 
etc. 
arthur mather (1979, p. 106) 

in western culture until newton the view of astrologer and scientist 
were not so very different. there was general belief that -all phenomena in 
the inferior elemental world of nature were govern in some way by the 
motions of the superior and incorruptible celestial bodies. since newton, 
however, the view of astrologer and scientist have become increasingly 
opposed. astrologer today stdl hold that the connection between celestial 
and earthly phenomena is so strong that knowing one allow us to predict 
the other. but scientist disagree. they point out that there is no plausible 
way the connection could work, or even a plausible theory of how it could 
work. survey of research into astrology have provided no evidence that 
astrology do work, at least not in the way and to the extent claim by 
astrologers. of course, every time we wake up with the sun, or plan barbe- 
cue on m o o d t nights, or go fishing at high tide, we are showing how celes- 
tie body have real influence in our lives; but this is very different from the 
connection clam by astrologers. go from one co the other is a quite 
unjusufy leap of faith. 
leahey and leahey (1983) noted that "most popular works on astrol-

ogy today do not even attempt to defend it but simply teach their reader 
how to use it" (p. 39). similarly, nia and dean (1986) pointed out, "no- 
body should be surprise to learn that the hardest things to find in astrology 
are facts" (p. 357). but if you know where to look they can certainly be 
found. 
before 1950 very few scientific study of astrology existed. something 
h e a dozen major statistic compilation by astrologer had appear since 
1900, notably in france, germany, england and the usa, but none were 
widely known, and in any case their methodology was too poor, e.g., no 
controls, for meaningful results. not surprisingly, the few publish critique 
were confine mostly to historical survey (e.g., thomen, 1938; bok & 
mayall, 1941; eisler, 1946). the only extensive scientific critique available 
was by the france astronomer paul couderc (1951/1974). then in 1955 
michel g a u q u e h publish his landmark l'lnfluence des astres, the first 
rigorous study of astrology claims, with generally negative result but with 
what seem to be provocative exception (gauqueh, 1955). 
during the next two decade various factor combine to establish a 
small but continue interest in astrology research, namely, the boom 
popular interest in astrology, further work by gauquelin (e.g., 1966, 1969), 
the occasional astrology-related paper in a scientific journal, and not least by 
astrologer themselves found research-oriented bodle such as the astro- 
logical association (uk) in 1958 and the international society for astrologi- 
cal research (usa) in 1970. the result was a notable increase in the number 
of critical studies. 
ln the 1970s there appear various critique of the occult that in- 
clude astrology (e.g., freedland, 1972; cooper, 1974; sladek, 1974; cazeau 
& scott, 1979) and critique devoted entire to astrology (e.g., parker, 1970; 
russell, 1972; gallant, 1974; dean & mather, 1977; jerome, 1977; standen, 
1977; kelly, 1979). the last was the first comprehensive critical review of as- 
trology's scientific research base. it took seven person-years to prepare, sur- 
veye many hundred of books and articles, and document over 150 em- 
piric stucbe publish in astrology journal and over twenty publish in 
psychology journal (dean & mather, 1977). by 1996, new studle and pre- 
vious miss study had brought these total to about 300 and 70, respec- 
tive (dean, nias, & french, 1997). 
the research interest that dean and mather (1977) stimulate led to 
the foundation in 1981 of correlation, an international peer-reviewed journal 
devoted entire to scientific research into astrology, follow in 1982 by 
astro-psychological problems, orient more toward gauquelin interests. by 
then the advent of home computer in the late 1970s had revolutionize 
astrology practice and research. calculating a birth chart once took any- 
where from an hour to a day; now it could be done in seconds, allow

research to do study that were previous unthinkable. today there is a 
scholarly research base that cover most of the basic claim of astrology. 
even sun slgn column have been tested. the outcome from all this, in what 
probably amount to well over two hundred person-years of research, is al- 
most uniform negative (dean, mather, & kelly, 1996). unfortunately, much 
of this work is neither widely known nor easily accessible, a point to which i 
will return shortly. 
critical review of astrology in the light of research findings, post-1980, 
include those by psychologist eysenck and nia (1982), astronomer culver 
and ianna (1988), crowe (1990), marten and trachet (1995), and the bible 
scholars, ankerberg and weldon (1989). the most recent review and the 
first to include meta-analyses are by kelly, dean, and saklofske (1990) and 
dean, mather, and kelly (1996). critique of philosophical, rehgious or so- 
cial aspect of astrology include kelly and krutzen (19831, leahey and 
leahey (1983), kanitscheider (1991), dean (1992), and dean and loptson 
(1996). review of the argument of astrologer include kelly, culver, and 
loptson (1989), and dean, mather, and kelly (1996). theory of astrology 
(including jung's synchronicity) are critical examine in dean, loptson, 
and kelly (1996). description of the gauquelin work include gauquelin 
(1983, 1988) and ertel (1992). the 'mars effect' is specifically address by 
benski, caudron. gahfret, krivine, pecker, rouze, and schatzman (19961, 
whose conclusion have been dspute by ertel and inlmg (1996). the cog- 
nit and perceptual bias that can underlie belief in astrology are brief 
review by dean (1992) and in detail by dean, kelly, saklofske, and furn- 
ham (1992), and dean, mather, and kelly (1996). recent critique of the 
occult that cover astrology include couttie (19881, hme (19881, and neher 
(1990). there is, of course, an extensive and ongoing literature on the his- 
tory of astrology, for example, ancient astrology (baigent, 1994; barton, 
1994; stewart, 1996), medieval psychology (kemp, 19901, pre- 19' century 
astrology (tester, 1987), and 19' century astrology (curry, 1992). 
why the present article? since the mid-1970s psychology journal have 
average a steady total per year of about two empirical study of astrologi- 
cal claims, plus an equal number devoted to related topic such as the accep- 
tance of astrology statement or the prevalence of belief in astrology, all of 
them easily accessible via psyclit, the america psychological association's 
computerize abstract database. but for every such empirical study there are 
at least four more of equal qu&ty in journal not accessible via psyclit. 
fortunately, most of the major review list above cover this wide informa- 
tion base. on the other hand, the review are generally more focus on 
empirical findtng than with paradigm and conceptual arguments. the pres- 
ent article focus on the latter and bring together previous scattered ma- 
terial.
