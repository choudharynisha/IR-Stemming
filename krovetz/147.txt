"ye stars which are the poetry of heaven! 

if, in your bright leaves we read the fate 

of men and empires—'tis to be forgiven, 

that in our aspiration to be great, 

our destiny o'erleap this mortal state 

and claim a kindred with you; for ye are 

a beauty and a mystery and create 

in us such love and reverence from afar, 

that life, fame, power, and fortune have name themselves a star."

foreword 

of all subject that have at any time engaged the attention of the 

world, there is none more ancient than astrology. in the east—where it 

first arose at a period of very remote antiquity—it still hold sway 

and in every part of the world (especially among the learned) it 

reign supreme until the middle of the seventeenth century. that it 

not only rule the daily action of individual but sway the council 

of princes, is shown by the record of every nation that has a history 

(and by none more fully than by that of england); yet the present 

generation seem never, until quite lately, to have care to inquire on 

what basis this belief could have been for so many age supported. 

during the past ten years, however—possibly from a reaction grow 

out of the realism by which we have been so long oppressed—a new 

interest in these old-world belief has sprung up and it is to satisfy 

that interest that this book (containing the result of many years' 

study) was written. 

chiromancy and physiognomy are both base on astrology and are, 

therefore, quite in place as the second and third parts of a work 

treat of the influence of the stars. many of the modern writer on 

chiromancy seem disposed to deny its affinity to astrology, with which 

it is, however, inseparable connected. dr. saunders, in the preface to 

his exhaustive work on chiromancy and physiognomy, publish in 1671, 

and dedicated to his friend lilly, the great astrologer, says: "for our 

more orderly proceeding with the body of this work, it is in the first 

place necessary to be observe that there are seven planets, name 

stellæ errantes—wandering stars—which have each of them its 

separate character as they are use in astrologie; the which stars have 

great power over inferior body and do, each of them, govern some part 

or other of man's body and they especially have their material 

existence in the hand and without astrology chiromancy could not 

subsist and be subservient to true wisdom." 

now, why, in the face of this and many other equally forcible words 

among the old-world authorities, do the modern writer try to force 

their own crude theory upon us? to drag the time-honoured study of 

chiromancy into the turmoil of nineteenth-century existence and—by 

rob it of its mysticism—to strain it into unison with the realism 

of modern thought, strike the earnest student with the same sense of 

incongruity as would the hanging of a carnival mask over the mystical 

calm features of an antique statue.

"to doubt the influence of the stars is to doubt the wisdom and 

providence of god."—tycho brahe. 



chapter i. 

that a certain power, derive from æthereal nature, pervade the whole 

earth, is clearly evident to all. fire and air are alter by the 

motions of the æther, and these elements, in their turn, encompass 

all inferior matter, vary it, as they themselves are varied, acting 

equally on earth and water, on plant and animals. the sun, not only by 

the change of the seasons, bring to perfection the embryo of animals, 

the bud of plant and the spring of water, but also, by his daily 

movement, bring light, heat, moisture, dry and cold. 

the moon, being of all the heavenly body the nearest to earth, has 

also much influence, and things animate and inanimate sympathise and 

vary with her. by her change river swell or are reduced, the tide of 

the sea are rule by her rising and settings, and animal and plant 

are influence as she wax or wanes. the stars also produce in the 

ambient
