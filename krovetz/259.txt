the well 

preface 
two men stood in the billiard-room of an old country house, talking. 
play, which had been of a half-hearted nature, was over, and they sat at 
the open window, look out over the park stretch away beneath them, 
converse idly. 

"your time's nearly up, jem," said one at length, "this time six week 
you'll be yawn out the honeymoon and curse the man--woman i mean-- 
who invent them." 

jem benson stretch his long limb in the chair and grunt in dissent. 

"i've never understood it," continue wilfre carr, yawning. "it's not 
in my line at all; i never had enough money for my own wants, let alone 
for two. perhaps if i were as rich as you or croesu i might regard it 
differently." 

there was just sufficient meaning in the latter part of the remark for 
his cousin to forbear to reply to it. he continue to gaze out of the 
window and to smoke slowly. 

"not being as rich as croesus--or you," resume carr, regarding him from 
beneath lower lids, "i paddle my own canoe down the stream of time, 
and, tie it to my friends' door-posts, go in to eat their dinners." 

"quite venetian," said jem benson, still look out of the window. 
"it's not a bad thing for you, wilfred, that you have the doorpost and 
dinners--and friends." 

carr grunt in his turn. "seriously though, jem," he said, slowly, 
"you're a lucky fellow, a very lucky fellow. if there is a better girl 
above ground than olive, i should like to see her." 

"yes," said the other, quietly. 

"she's such an exceptional girl," continue carr, staring out of the 
window. "she's so good and gentle. she think you are a bundle of all 
the virtues." 

he laugh frankly and joyously, but the other man did not join him. 
"strong sense--of right and wrong, though," continue carr, musingly. 
"do you know, i believe that if she found out that you were not----" 

"not what?" demand benson, turning upon him fiercely, "not what?" 

"everything that you are," return his cousin, with a grin that belie 
his words, "i believe she'd drop you." 

"talk about something else," said benson, slowly; "your pleasantry are 
not always in the best taste." 

wilfre carr rose and taking a cue from the rack, bent over the board and 
practiced one or two favourite shots. "the only other subject i can talk 
about just at present is my own financial affairs," he said slowly, as he 
walk round the table. 

"talk about something else," said benson again, bluntly. 

"and the two things are connected," said carr, and drop his cue he 
half sat on the table and eye his cousin. 

there was a long silence. benson pitch the end of his cigar out of the 
window, and leaning back closed his eyes. 

"do you follow me?" inquire carr at length. 

benson open his eyes and nod at the window. 

"do you want to follow my cigar?" he demanded. 

"i should prefer to depart by the usual way for your sake," return the 
other, unabashed. "if i left by the window all sort of question would 
be asked, and you know what a talkative chap i am." 

"so long as you don't talk about my affairs," return the other, 
restrain himself by an obvious effort, "you can talk yourself hoarse." 

"i'm in a mess," said carr, slowly, "a devil of a mess. if i don't raise 
fifteen hundred by this day fortnight, i may be get my board and 
lodging free." 

"would that be any change?" question benson. 

"the quality would," retort the other. "the address also would not be 
good. seriously, jem, will you let me have the fifteen hundred?" 

"no," said the other, simply. 

carr went white. "it's to save me from ruin," he said, thickly. 

"i've help you till i'm tired," said benson, turning and regarding him, 
"and it is all to no good. if you've got into a mess, get out of it. 
you should not be so fond of give autograph away." 

"it's foolish, i admit," said carr, deliberately. "i won't do so any 
more. by the way, i've got some to sell. you needn't sneer. they're 
not my own." 

"whose are they?" inquire the other. 

"yours." 

benson got up from his chair and cross over to him. "what is this?" 
he asked, quietly. "blackmail?" 

"call it what you like," said carr. "i've got some letters for sale, 
price fifteen hundred. and i know a man who would buy them at that price 
for the mere chance of get olive from you. i'll give you first 
offer." 

"if you have got any letters bearing my signature, you will be good 
enough to give them to me," said benson, very slowly. 

"they're mine," said carr, lightly; "given to me by the lady you wrote 
them to. i must say that they are not all in the best possible taste." 

his cousin reach forward suddenly, and catching him by the collar of 
his coat pin him down on the table. 

"give me those letters," he breathed, stick his face close to carr's. 

"they're not here," said carr, struggling. "i'm not a fool. let me go, 
or i'll raise the price." 

the other man raise him from the table in his powerful hands, apparently 
with the intention of dashing his head against it. then sudden his 
hold relax as an astonished-looking maid-servant enter the room with 
letters. carr sat up hastily. 

"that's how it was done," said benson, for the girl's benefit as he took 
the letters. 

"i don't wonder at the other man making him pay for it, then," said carr, 
blandly. 

"you will give me those letters?" said benson, suggestively, as the girl 
left the room. 

"at the price i mentioned, yes," said carr; "but so sure as i am a living 
man, if you lay your clumsy hand on me again, i'll double it. now, i'll 
leave you for a time while you think it over." 

he took a cigar from the box and lighting it careful quit the room. 
his cousin wait until the door had closed behind him, and then turning 
to the window sat there in a fit of fury as silent as it was terrible. 

the air was fresh and sweet from the park, heavy with the scent of 
new-mown grass. the fragrance of a cigar was now add to it, and 
glancing out he saw his cousin pace slow by. he rose and went to the 
door, and then, apparently alter his mind, he return to the window 
and watch the figure of his cousin as it move slow away into the 
moonlight. then he rose again, and, for a long time, the room was empty. 

* * * * * 

it was empty when mrs. benson came in some time later to say good-night 
to her son on her way to bed. she walk slow round the table, and 
pause at the window gaze from it in idle thought, until she saw the 
figure of her son advance with rapid stride toward the house. he 
look up at the window. 

"good-night," said she. 

"good-night," said benson, in a deep voice. 

"where is wilfred?" 

"oh, he has gone," said benson. 

"gone?" 

"we had a few words; he was wanting money again, and i gave him a piece 
of my mind. i don't think we shall see him again." 

"poor wilfred!" sigh mrs. benson. "he is always in trouble of some 
sort. i hope that you were not too hard upon him." 

"no more than he deserved," said her son, sternly. "good night." 


ii. 

the well, which had long ago fallen into disuse, was almost hidden by the 
thick tangle of undergrowth which ran riot at that corner of the old 
park. it was partly cover by the shrunken half of a lid, above which a 
rusty windlass creak in company with the music of the pine when the 
wind blew strongly. the full light of the sun never reach it, and the 
ground surrounding it was moist and green when other parts of the park 
were gape with the heat. 

two people walking slow round the park in the fragrant still of a 
summer evening stray in the direction of the well. 

"no use go through this wilderness, olive," said benson, pause on 
the outskirts of the pine and eye with some disfavour the gloom 
beyond. 

"best part of the park," said the girl briskly; "you know it's my 
favourite spot." 

"i know you're very fond of sitting on the coping," said the man slowly, 
"and i wish you wouldn't. one day you will lean back too far and fall 
in." 

"and make the acquaintance of truth," said olive lightly. "come along." 

she ran from him and was lost in the shadow of the pines, the bracken 
crackling beneath her feet as she ran. her companion follow slowly, 
and emerge from the gloom saw her poised dainty on the edge of the 
well with her feet hidden in the rank grass and nettle which surround 
it. she motion her companion to take a seat by her side, and smile 
soft as she felt a strong arm pass about her waist. 

"i like this place," said she, break a long silence, "it is so dismal 
--so uncanny. do you know i wouldn't dare to sit here alone, jem. i 
should imagine that all sort of dreadful things were hidden behind the 
bush and trees, wait to spring out on me. ugh!" 

"you'd better let me take you in," said her companion tenderly; "the well 
isn't always wholesome, especially in the hot weather. 

"let's make a move." 

the girl gave an obstinate little shake, and settled herself more 
secure on her seat. 

"smoke your cigar in peace," she said quietly. "i am settled here for a 
quiet talk. has anything been heard of wilfre yet?" 

"nothing." 

"quite a dramatic disappearance, isn't it?" she continued. "another 
scrape, i suppose, and another letter for you in the same old strain; 
'dear jem, help me out.'" 

jem benson blew a cloud of fragrant smoke into the air, and holding his 
cigar between his teeth brush away the ash from his coat sleeves. 

"i wonder what he would have done without you," said the girl, pressing 
his arm affectionately. "gone under long ago, i suppose. when we are 
married, jem, i shall presume upon the relationship to lecture him. he 
is very wild, but he has his good points, poor fellow." 

"i never saw them," said benson, with startle bitterness. "god know i 
never saw them." 

"he is nobody's enemy but his own," said the girl, startle by this 
outburst. 

"you don't know much about him," said the other, sharply. "he was not 
above blackmail; not above ruin the life of a friend to do himself a 
benefit. a loafer, a cur, and a liar!" 

the girl look up at him sober but timid and took his arm without a 
word, and they both sat silent while evening deepen into night and the 
beam of the moon, filter through the branches, surround them with a 
silver network. her head sank upon his shoulder, till sudden with a 
sharp cry she sprang to her feet. 

"what was that?" she cry breathlessly. 

"what was what?" demand benson, spring up and clutch her fast by 
the arm. 

she caught her breath and try to laugh. 

"you're hurt me, jem." 

his hold relaxed. 

"what is the matter?" he ask gently. 

"what was it startle you?" 

"i was startled," she said, slowly, putt her hand on his shoulder. 
"i suppose the words i use just now are ring in my ears, but i 
fancy that somebody behind us whisper 'jem, help me out.'" 

"fancy," repeated benson, and his voice shook; "but these fancies are not 
good for you. you--are frightened--at the dark and the gloom of these 
trees. let me take you back to the house." 

"no, i'm not frightened," said the girl, reseat herself. "i should 
never be really frightened of anything when you were with me, jem. i'm 
surprise at myself for being so silly." 

the man made no reply but stood, a strong, dark figure, a yard or two 
from the well, as though wait for her to join him. 

"come and sit down, sir," cry olive, pat the brickwork with her 
small, white hand, "one would think that you did not like your company." 

he obey slow and took a seat by her side, drawing so hard at his 
cigar that the light of it shone upon his fare at every breath. he 
pass his arm, firm and rigid as steel, behind her, with his hand 
rest on the brickwork beyond. 

"are you warm enough?" he ask tenderly, as she made a little movement. 
"pretty fair," she shivered; "one oughtn't to be cold at this time of the 
year, but there's a cold, damp air come up from the well." 

as she spoke a faint splash sound from the depths below, and for the 
second time that evening, she sprang from the well with a little cry of 
dismay. 

"what is it now?" he ask in a fearful voice. he stood by her side and 
gaze at the well, as though half expect to see the cause of her alarm 
emerge from it. 

"oh, my bracelet," she cry in distress, "my poor mother's bracelet. 
i've drop it down the well." 

"your bracelet!" repeated benson, dully. "your bracelet? the diamond 
one?" 

"the one that was my mother's," said olive. "oh, we can get it back 
surely. we must have the water drain off." 

"your bracelet!" repeated benson, stupidly. 

"jem," said the girl in terrify tones, "dear jem, what is the matter?" 

for the man she love was standing regarding her with horror. the moon 
which touched it was not responsible for all the white of the 
distort face, and she shrank back in fear to the edge of the well. he 
saw her fear and by a mighty effort regain his composure and took her 
hand. 

"poor little girl," he murmured, "you frightened me. i was not look 
when you cried, and i thought that you were slip from my arms, 
down--down--" 

his voice broke, and the girl throw herself into his arms clung to him 
convulsively. 

"there, there," said benson, fondly, "don't cry, don't cry." 

"to-morrow," said olive, half-laughing, half-crying, "we will all come 
round the well with hook and line and fish for it. it will be quite a 
new sport." 

"no, we must try some other way," said benson. "you shall have it back." 

"how?" ask the girl. 

"you shall see," said benson. "to-morrow morning at latest you shall 
have it back. till then promise me that you will not mention your loss 
to anyone. promise." 

"i promise," said olive, wonderingly. "but why not?" 

"it is of great value, for one thing, and--but there--there are many 
reasons. for one thing it is my duty to get it for you." 

"wouldn't you like to jump down for it?" she ask mischievously. 
"listen." 

she stoop for a stone and drop it down. 

"fancy being where that is now," she said, peer into the blackness; 
"fancy go round and round like a mouse in a pail, clutch at the 
slimy sides, with the water filling your mouth, and look up to the 
little patch of sky above." 

"you had better come in," said benson, very quietly. "you are develop 
a taste for the morbid and horrible." 

the girl turned, and taking his arm walk slow in the direction of the 
house; mrs. benson, who was sitting in the porch, rose to receive them. 

"you shouldn't have kept her out so long," she said chidingly. "where 
have you been?" 

"sitting on the well," said olive, smiling, "discussing our future." 

"i don't believe that place is healthy," said mrs. benson, emphatically. 
"i really think it might be fill in, jem." 

"all right," said her son, slowly. "pity it wasn't fill in long ago." 

he took the chair vacate by his mother as she enter the house with 
olive, and with his hand hanging limp over the side sat in deep 
thought. after a time he rose, and go upstairs to a room which was 
set apart for sporting requisite select a sea fishing line and some 
hook and stole soft downstairs again. he walk swift across the 
park in the direction of the well, turning before he enter the shadow 
of the tree to look back at the light window of the house. then 
have arrange his line he sat on the edge of the well and cautious 
lower it. 

he sat with his lip compressed, occasional look about him in a 
startle fashion, as though he half expect to see something peer at 
him from the belt of trees. time after time he lower his line until at 
length in pull it up he heard a little metallic tinkle against the 
side of the well. 

he held his breath then, and forget his fear drew the line in inch 
by inch, so as not to lose its precious burden. his pulse beat rapidly, 
and his eyes were bright. as the line came slow in he saw the catch 
hanging to the hook, and with a steady hand drew the last few feet in. 
then he saw that instead of the bracelet he had hooked a bunch of keys. 

with a faint cry he shook them from the hook into the water below, and 
stood breathing heavily. not a sound broke the still of the night. 
he walk up and down a bit and stretch his great muscles; then he came 
back to the well and resume his task. 

for an hour or more the line was lower without result. in his 
eager he forgot his fears, and with eyes bent down the well fish 
slow and carefully. twice the hook became entangle in something, and 
was with difficulty released. it caught a third time, and all his 
effort failed' to free it. then he drop the line down the well, 
and with head bent walk toward the house. 

he went first to the stable at the rear, and then retiring to his room 
for some time pace restless up and down. then without remove his 
clothes he flung himself upon the bed and fell into a trouble sleep. 


iii. 

long before anybody else was astir he arose and stole soft downstairs. 
the sunlight was steal in at every crevice, and flash in long 
streak across the darken rooms. the dining-room into which he look 
struck chill and cheerless in the dark yellow light which came through 
the lower blinds. he remember that it had the same appearance when 
his father lay dead in the house; now, as then, everything seem ghastly 
and unreal; the very chair standing as their occupant had left them the 
night before seem to be indulge in some dark communication of ideas. 

slow and noiseless he open the hall door and pass into the 
fragrant air beyond. the sun was shining on the drench grass and 
trees, and a slow vanish white mist roll like smoke about the 
grounds. for a moment he stood, breathing deep the sweet air of the 
morning, and then walk slow in the direction of the stables. 

the rusty creak of a pump-handle and a spatter of water upon the 
red-tiled courtyard show that somebody else was astir, and a few steps 
farther he beheld a brawny, sandy-haired man gasp wildly under severe 
self-infliction at the pump. 

"everything ready, george?" he ask quietly. 

"yes, sir," said the man, straighten up sudden and touching his 
forehead. "bob's just finish the arrangement inside. it's a lovely 
morning for a dip. the water in that well must be just icy." 

"be as quick as you can," said benson, impatiently. 

"very good, sir," said george, burnish his face harsh with a very 
small towel which had been hanging over the top of the pump. "hurry up, 
bob." 

in answer to his summons a man appear at the door of the stable with a 
coil of stout rope over his arm and a large metal candlestick in his 
hand. 

"just to try the air, sir," said george, following his master's glance, 
"a well get rather foul sometimes, but if a candle can live down it, a 
man can." 

his master nodded, and the man, hasty pull up the neck of his shirt 
and thrust his arms into his coat, follow him as he led the way 
slow to the well. 

"beg pardon, sir," said george, drawing up to his side, "but you are not 
look over and above well this morning. if you'll let me go down i'd 
enjoy the bath." 

"no, no," said benson, peremptorily. 

"you ain't fit to go down, sir," persist his follower. "i've never 
seen you look so before. now if--" 

"mind your business," said his master curtly. 

george became silent and the three walk with swinging stride through 
the long wet grass to the well. bob flung the rope on the ground and at 
a sign from his master hand him the candlestick. 

"here's the line for it, sir," said bob, fumble in his pockets. 

benson took it from him and slow tie it to the candlestick. then he 
placed it on the edge of the well, and striking a match, lit the candle 
and began slow to lower it. 

"hold hard, sir," said george, quickly, lay his hand on his arm, "you 
must tilt it or the string'll burn through." 

even as he spoke the string part and the candlestick fell into the 
water below. 

benson swore quietly. 

"i'll soon get another," said george, start up. 

"never mind, the well's all right," said benson. 

"it won't take a moment, sir," said the other over his shoulder. 

"are you master here, or am i?" said benson hoarsely. 

george came back slowly, a glance at his master's face stopping the 
protest upon his tongue, and he stood by watch him sulky as he sat 
on the well and remove his outer garments. both men watch him 
curiously, as have complete his preparation he stood grim and silent 
with his hand by his sides. 

"i wish you'd let me go, sir," said george, pluck up courage to 
address him. "you ain't fit to go, you've got a chill or something. i 
shouldn't wonder it's the typhoid. they've got it in the village bad." 

for a moment benson look at him angrily, then his gaze softened. "not 
this time, george," he said, quietly. he took the loop end of the rope 
and placed it under his arms, and sitting down threw one leg over the 
side of the well. 

"how are you go about it, sir?" query george, lay hold of the 
rope and sign to bob to do the same. 

"i'll call out when i reach the water," said benson; "then pay out three 
yard more quick so that i can get to the bottom." 

"very good, sir," answer both. 

their master threw the other leg over the coping and sat motionless. his 
back was turn toward the men as he sat with head bent, look down the 
shaft. he sat for so long that george became uneasy. 

"all right, sir?" he inquired. 

"yes," said benson, slowly. "if i tug at the rope, george, pull up at 
once. lower away." 

the rope pass steady through their hand until a hollow cry from the 
dark below and a faint splash warn them that he had reach the 
water. they gave him three yard more and stood with relax grasp and 
strained ears, waiting. 

"he's gone under," said bob in a low voice. 

the other nodded, and moisten his huge palm took a firm grip of the 
rope. 

fully a minute passed, and the men began to exchange uneasy glances. 
then a sudden tremendous jerk follow by a series of feeble one nearly 
tore the rope from their grasp. 

"pull!" shout george, place one foot on the side and haul 
desperately. "pull! pull! he's stuck fast; he's not coming; pull!" 

in response to their terrific exertion the rope came slow in, inch by 
inch, until at length a violent splash was heard, and at the same 
moment a scream of unutterable horror came echo up the shaft. 

"what a weight he is !" pant bob. "he's stuck fast or something. 
keep still, sir; for heaven's sake, keep still." 

for the taut rope was being jerk violent by the struggle of the 
weight at the end of it. both men with grunt and sigh haul it in 
foot by foot. 

"all right, sir," cry george, cheerfully. 

he had one foot against the well, and was pull manfully; the burden 
was near the top. a long pull and a strong pull, and the face of a 
dead man with mud in the eyes and nostril came peer over the edge. 
behind it was the ghastly face of his master; but this he saw too late, 
for with a great cry he let go his hold of the rope and step back. 
the sudden overthrew his assistant, and the rope tore through his 
hands. there was a frightful splash. 

"you fool!" stammer bob, and ran to the well helplessly. 

"run!" cry george. "run for another line." 

he bent over the coping and call eager down as his assistant sped 
back to the stable shouting wildly. his voice re-echoed down the shaft, 
but all else was silence.
