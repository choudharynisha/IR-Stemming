chapter one 


new york, new york. a blissful spring morning beckoned, cloudless and 
blue and pure. i was driving my high-mileage toyota down seventh 
avenue, head for the location shoot that was supposed to wind up 
principal photography for my first feature film, _baby love_. it was 
about the pain and joy of adoption. i guess direct your first 
feature is something like give birth to your first child, but that 
get us way, way ahead of the story. 

my name, by the way, is morgan smyth james, after two grandmothers, and 
i'm thirty-eight and single and strive to be eternal optimistic. that 
morning, however, in spite of everything else, i was missing steve 
terribly and feeling like i'd screw up essential component of my 
life. 

to try for some perspective, let me say i'd always plan to have a 
normal, loving family. really. find an emotionally present soul mate 
who care about things i care about--okay, slim and smart and 
spectacular in bed wouldn't be a minus--get married on a lawn with lot 
of white rose some sunny june afternoon, work one or even two perfect 
kid into our fulfilling, give lives. but somehow i'd manage to have 
none of that. i'd mess up at every turn. 

in reality i had nobody to blame but myself. eighteen years ago, just 
out of college, i turn down two really nice guys. my body was fertile 
and hormone-driven--was it ever!--but grad school loom and my 
greatest fear (instead of, as now, my fondest hope) was get 
"trapped" into motherhood. also, i had the youthful delusion that life 
was forever. 

there was, in truth, one simpatico young director i met at nyu film 
school whom i would have married in a minute, but after jason won my 
heart he dump me for his undergraduate sweetheart who had skillful 
gotten herself knock up during his christmas break. 

which was when i first develop my fallback strategy for coping with 
bad news. after mope around in sweat for two days, cutting class and 
hiding in a revival house showing a goddard retrospective, not 
understanding half the france and too bleary-eyed to read the 
subtitles, i decided to build a defense system. from that day on, i'd 
put all heartbreak in a special box, nail down the lid, and act as 
though it wasn't there. it work then and it still works, more or 
less, now. people sometimes accuse me of living in selective denial 
(they're right), but it make me one heck of a survivor. 

and something else. i decided then and there to focus my life: i'd 
concentrate on learning to make movies and let the family part just 
play out naturally. i had the idea that whereas men's affection 
couldn't be controlled, a career could. even then i realize it was 
only a partial truth, but i decided to go with it anyway. 

which bring us down to three years back. and a funny thing was 
happening. almost without realize it, i'd start lingering in stores 
to look at little pink jumpers, begun gaze into the baby carriage 
that sudden seem to be sprout everywhere. the phrase "my baby" 
became the most powerful one i could imagine, made my throat swell till 
i'd half choke. 

at which precise time, like a _deus ex machina_, enter steve abrams, 
the man who gave me hope. he came along just as i was notice that 
infinite stream of wonderful guy had dwindle down to relationship 
dropouts, men with distant eyes and former wives in other states. we 
discover each other at the reopen oloffson hotel in haiti, where i 
was shoot a documentary about voodoo and he was photograph that 
country's ragged, plucky children for national geographic. no 
ex-spouses, no need for psychic pampering. okay, he wasn't go to win 
a mr. universe contest any time soon; he had a couple of extra pound 
that, actually, i kind of liked. but he was my age, had great brown 
eyes, sandy hair thin only just a bit. no greece god but definitely 
a man. he could tune a jeep carburetor with his eyes closed or fix a 
cranky hotel lock, then recite byron (sort of) and proceed to snare the 
perfect chile red for crawfish _etouffee_ (yes!). but i knew i love 
him when i realize it was more than any of that. i felt as if i'd 
found the other half of myself. just one glance across the table and we 
each knew what the other was thinking, feeling. we'd laugh at the same 
instant, then as though on cue, half cry together over the misery of 
that wretched island. sometimes it was almost eerie. and as for 
lovemaking, let me just say steve didn't need a how-to manual. we were 
made for each other. 

maybe it's un-pc to mention it, but i also felt safe around him. and i 
think he felt the same. we like that feeling. us fend off the world. 

when we got back to new york, we had to see each other every day. we 
still had separate apartments--thanks to the new york real-estate 
squeeze--but we were scout in our spare time for an afford loft 
in lower manhattan that could accommodate steve's darkroom, my office, 
and--yes--a baby. we evolve into parents-to-be, price baby 
carriages. who could have predict it? the joy of share a need. it 
was a total high. 

before long we decided to stop wait for the perfect 

space. we'd start on the baby anyway, our first joint project--which, 
we believed, would only be the first of many. 

but nothing happened. over a year and still nothing. 

that was when life began to feel like a cruel bait-and-switch. when you 
aren't ready, you can produce a baby in a momentary absence-of-mind, 
whereas once you're finally an adult, accomplished, lots-to-offer 
woman, ready to be the mother you wish you'd had, your body has closed 
down your baby-making equipment like an unused rust belt factory. 
fertility has calculating abandoned you for the sun belt of youth. 

"well," dr. hannah klein, my long-time ob/gyn, declared, "our test all 
indicate you're both fertile, so just keep trying, under optimum 
conditions." 

optimum conditions. there follow almost a year of "optimum 
conditions." do it upside down; wait and have a cold shower while i 
take my temperature; no, not that way, not tonight. my mucus is 
thicker: quick! eventually we both began feeling like laboratory rats. 
our once-incredible love life drift into something only a boot-camp 
sergeant with nazi leaning could be turn on by. 

i think that's what finally cause steve to go over the edge. three 
month ago--a friday morning i shall never forget--he step out of my 
shower, swathe himself in a white towel, and announce he was go to 
central america to do a book. he need time to think. the move, he 
explained, wasn't about us. he really want to spend a year down there 
with his nikon, capture the region's tentative process of 
democratic transition. besides, he was beginning to think we'd both 
gone a little mental about the baby. 

out came that special box of heartbreak again. i console myself we 
were just have a seventh-inning stretch, but the wisdom in that box 
told me i'd somehow blown it. the baby we hadn't create had become a 
specter hover in the ether between us, ever a reminder of failure. 

as a parting gesture, the never-say-die long shot, he left a "deposit" 
with dr. klein--for her liquid-nitrogen womb-in-waiting--enough for two 
final intrauterine inseminations. later on today i was go to see her 
and find out if our last and final attempt had stuck. but nothing about 
my cycle was give me any hope. 

in the meantime, though, i had a movie to finish. we were shoot an 
interview at a five-story condominium building in greenwich village 
belong to a woman name car grove, who'd recently adopted. her 
story was intriguing, but now--with my own hope of ever have a baby 
down to two out in the bottom of the ninth--well, now i had more than 
one reason for wanting to meet her. . . . 

when i arrived, i luck into a parking space right in front. our 
security guy, lou crenshaw, was off today get some city paperwork 
sort out, but my crew was already upstairs--as director i get to 
arrive at a decent hour, though later on i also get to do lonely 
postproduction work till midnight--leaving our three van 
double-parked, with a new york city film board permit prominent 
display inside each windshield. the building, formerly a hertz 
parking garage, was near the end of barrow street, facing the hudson 
river, and was fill with artist and entrepreneurs. 

the truth was, i want to get the interview on film as soon as 
possible. i was more than a little worried car might decide to get 
cold feet and back out. she'd start to hedge when i had one last 
confirm chat with her last night, something about a "no-disclosure" 
agreement she now remember signing. this had to be a one-take, 
all-or-nothing shoot. 

which was why i'd sent down the full gang this morning, not just the 
"key" personnel as i'd initially planned. leading my (motley) crew was 
the director of photography, first cameraman roger drexel, a grizzled 
veteran with a ponytail who'd been with my producer, david roth and his 
applecore productions, from back when he did beach movies and splatter 
films. he work with the production manager, erica cole, our lipstick 
lesbian, who coordinate crew schedules. the second camera was handle 
by greer seiber, recently of nyu film school, who was so happy to have 
a job, any job, she act as though david's previous string of 
low-budget, b-flick epic were remake of _gone with the wind_. 

scott ventri, another applecore old-timer, was key grip, the guy who 
got the gear on and off the vans, set it up, and sign off on safety 
regs. today he also was responsible for blacking out window and 
setting up lights. the chief electrician, gaffer, was ralph cafiero, 
who'd come down the previous day and temporary hot-wired the circuit 
breaker in the apartment to make sure there was enough amperage. he and 
his lighting "crew," another bright-eyed (and cheap) nyu grad name 
paul nulty, had arrive this morning ahead of everybody else to 
pre-light the "set," a northeast corner of the apartment. 

i'm always a little hyper about sound, so i'd ask tony wills, who 
handle recording, to also come down the previous day and record the 
"tone" of the living room, the sound when there is no sound, in order 
to have it available for editing. today he'd run the boom mike and be 
assist by sherry moran, his latest girlfriend, who was 
mixer/recordist. for carly's makeup and hair, i had arlene morris, an 
old friend from all the way back to my early days as an ad on the 
soaps. . . . 

i rang carly's bell and she buzz me right up. 

she doubtless had a closet full of donna karan suits, but she came to 
the door in pre-faded jeans and a striped sweater. 

a successful publicity agent, she was petite, with dark hair and eyes 
and an obvious don't-bug-me take on life. 

"come on in. my nanny's here to help keep kevin out of the way." she 
was sound like she'd gotten her old spunk back, or so it seem at 
first. "i've completely clear the living room." 

i look around the place, now a vision of setup pandemonium. "you're 
sure this is all right?" 

"well . . ." she was biting at her lip. "maybe we ought to talk first, 
okay? but come on in. i'll probably do it. maybe i just need a good 
reason to. . . ." 

as her voice trail off, i found myself mining my brain for a sales 
point. finally, out of the blue, i settled on one. "because you're 
total crazy?" 

she laugh out loud. "not a bad start. i live in total madness. it's 
the definition of my life." 

i laugh too and look around. no kidding. her loft apartment was a 
wild mixture of stairs and gallery and levels--unconventional in 
every way. also, it had a lot of in-your-face decor, outrageous 
posters, and africa fertility masks, sign of a wonderful, irreverent 
personality. then too, stuff animal and toy were strewn all over. 

"i can't really afford the rent," she declared, seeing me survey the 
place, "but i need the space for kevin. i've just join bloomingdale's 
anonymous. twelve steps to shred your charge plates." 

her nanny, a jehovah's witness from jamaica name marcy (who remind 
me of a cuddly voodoo doll, complete with cornrows), was bring 
carly's little boy kevin down from his bath in the upstairs bathroom. 

he was definitely adopted, sandy-haired and peachy, nothing like 
carly's dark, severe strand and mediterranean skin. when marcy put him 
down, he try to walk, and i felt my envy ratchet upward a notch. he'd 
just start taking tentative steps, at eleven month old, and there 
was still a frankenstein quality as he strode stiff-legged, arms out 
for balance. 

i walk over, picked him up, and gave him a kiss. he look like a 
scandinavian travel poster, a cherub vision, and i felt a great void 
grow where my heart had been. then marcy reach out and pry him 
from me. i hate to let him go so much i almost pull him back. 

"you're so lucky," i said to carly, feeling a surge of yearning. "he's 
great." 

"you know," she said, "i've been thinking about that 'no disclosure' 
thing children of light made me sign. that's their name, by the way. 
like a vow of silence about them. they seem pretty serious about it." 

dear god, i thought, don't let her chicken out. don't, don't. 

"so, we won't mention them. just never use their name." 

she stood a minute, mute, and then her eyes grew determined. "no, i've 
got a better idea. i like you. and i think more single women ought to 
know about adoption. so you know what? i think i'll use their name all 
over the damn place. i paid what they asked, and for that i ought to 
be able to do what i want. what are they go to do? come and steal 
kevin back?" 

then she sigh and stare at me. "maybe, though, you could run through 
again how exactly we fit into this movie." 

i like to tell the story to people, just to get their reaction. there 
are always moments of doubt in the film-making process when you wonder 
if the audience for your picture is go to consist entire of your 
immediate family, your backers, and your creditors. 

"well, as i try to explain before, it's a fictional construct 
intended to feel like a documentary, about a career slave name gail 
crea who's base on a hundred women i know. she's got a great career, 
manage fund-raising for a major museum, and work is go great. but 
then one day she find herself sudden daydream about babies, 
envy mothers. she yearn for someone to take care of, has a 
recurrent dream she's steal a baby out of a carriage on the street. 
it's demeaning." 

"god," car said, "i know exactly what you're talk about. i've been 
there. have i ever." 

the truth was, i also knew it all too well. it was poignant and 
demean at the same time. 

"anyway, gail's focus on career all through her twenties, and by her 
late thirty she's become a serious professional. but her personal 
life is still on hold. she 'meets people' at work, or some other way, 
and she has a couple of long-standing relationship that finally crater 
because the guys, make that commit-ophobes, 'need space.' along the 
way, there're ghastly fix-ups and dismal dinner with what seem like a 
hundred thousand misfits. she become the date queen of new york, but 
eventually she realize all the men she's meeting are either assuage 
their midlife crisis with some pneumatic bombshell name bambi, or 
they're divorce and whine and carry a ton of emotional baggage. 
the fact is, she's become the sensible, successful professional she's 
been look for all this time. this all sort of seep in as back 
story." 

i perch on a stool at the breakfast bar and look down at my jeans, 
and notice that a rip was start in the crotch. shit, back to 
cottage cheese. those horrible eight pound i could never get rid of. 

i cross my legs. "finally, after she get a couple more promotions, 
she wake up one morning and realize she's never go to have a 
family. all the stable, rational men have disappeared. like there's a 
black hole or something. nothing's left but the walking wounded. she 
conclude it's actually easy to get a baby than a decent guy--which 
is what she start try to do. high concept: this picture is about 
how adopt a baby can enrich the life of a childless human being and, 
not coincidentally, bring joy to an orphan infant." 

i remember when i'd first pitch it to david roth of applecore. his 
response had been; "definitely art-house. probably never get past the 
angelika. a wide release is gonna be three screen where they serve 
ice cappuccino." 

i was dead set to prove him wrong. 

"so," i wound up, "i've shot the entire film, but now, thinking it 
over, i've decided there's one last thing i need to do. as i go through 
the story, at every step of the adoption process i want to cut to an 
interview, just talk heads, tight shot, of somebody who actually 
went through it. nonfiction. the real-life happy ending. and that's 
where you come in." 

what i wasn't telling her was, i was increasingly concerned the picture 
might be slightly hollow without this punch of real life. 

"well," car declared with a grin, "my ending couldn't be happier." 

"okay, want to get started?" i look around at arlene, makeup, who 
always seem to have more on her face than in her bag. i kid her 
about that a lot. but she was actually the one who had found carly, 
bump into her at a gym in the village. 

"hey, let's go for it." arlene grinned. 

i turn back to carly. "so how's about we prep a little while you're 
get the 'natural' look?" 

in the back of my mind i knew what i want for the interview. 
something like the feeling i remember from _the thin blue line_, 
where people engaged in hamlet-like monologue that told us more about 
them than they themselves knew, that let us really know their secret 
and their fears. the interview was never seen or heard. 

arlene ensconce car at the dine room table, a weather country 
french, where she'd already unfold and plug in a mirror with 
lights. 

"having kevin has been wonderful," car began. "he's change my life. 
sure, being a single 'supermom' make for a lot of bad-hair days, but 
no matter how much i complain, it's worth every burp." 

i thought momentarily about have her hold him during the interview, 
but instantly decided it would be too distracting. kevin and his 
wonderful eyes would commandeer the camera. a kid this cute in a scene 
was nothing less than grand larceny. 

he came toddle in now, drag a stuff brown bear. then he bang 
its head and try to say its name. "benny." his funny, awkward walk 
remind me a little of lou crenshaw after a couple of drinks. god, he 
was fantastic. 

"come here, sweetie." i picked him up, inhale his fresh baby scent, 
and want to hold him forever--while he slam the bear against my 
face. this child, i thought, is too good to be true. 

he was wearing a small bracelet around his left ankle, a tiny little 
chain, with a small silver medallion attached. it look like the face 
of a cat. funny. car didn't have a cat, wasn't a cat person, so why 
the little bracelet? and the back had a bunch of lines and dots, like a 
jumbled-up morse code. 

ask her about that, i thought. but later. 

now car was caught up in the sound of her own voice and on a roll. 
while arlene continue with the makeup, moving to her eyes, she bubble 
on. 

"like i told you on the phone, i try and try to adopt, through a 
whole bunch of lawyers, but it was a nightmare. one guy even help me 
put ads in newspaper all around the country, but nothing worked. i 
kept get scamm by women who want thousand of dollar up front, 
then back out at the last minute." she was get up, look 
intense. "let me have a minute. i want to make coffee for everybody." 

i follow her into the kitchen, which was the "country" type with a 
faux granite counter and lot of copper-bottomed pan hanging from the 
ceiling. 

she was right about the pain of adoption, which was why her story was 
such a burst of sunshine. as part of the start-up research for my 
picture, i'd actually gone to meet an adoption attorney out in 
brooklyn, a sleazy-looking guy name frank brasco. i'd been pretend 
to be a client, to find out firsthand how tough it really was. what i 
heard was chilling. 

"i don't want to get your hope up," he'd declared for cheery openers. 
"finding a healthy, caucasian, america baby is virtually out of the 
question, so naturally we focus on foreign-borns. all the same, it can 
take years, and there's incredible paperwork. passport for the kid, an 
extend visa for you while you go there and then wait around to 
process everything in triplicate. bribes, corruption, you can't 
imagine." he sigh and adjust his toupee, as though the very thought 
made him weary. "and that's just the foreign end. here you have the 
ins, the immigrate and naturalize service. they give 
bean-counting paper-pushers a bad name." he examine me closely. "not 
jewish, i take it. 'cause if that's what you're look for, you may 
have to wait for the messiah." 

now, almost a year and a lot of experience later, i knew full well how 
right he was. which was what made carly's story so fantastic. 

"so how did you manage to get kevin? you said it only took a few 
months?" 

"well, to go back to the beginning, i didn't start out wanting to 
adopt. but when the guy i was plan to marry got cold feet--after 
four and a half years, the louse--and there was nobody else on the 
horizon, i decided to just have a baby on my own. you know, find some 
smart, good-looking hunk, seduce him, and get things go the 
old-fashioned way, or if that didn't work, then i figured i'd just go 
to a sperm bank. who needs an actual man, right?" 

she took out a white and green bag of coffee beans, label balducci's 
on the side. i was still holding kevin, who threw benny onto the floor, 
then began to sniffle and point. 

but car seem not to notice as she shook the coffee bean into the 
grinder. "well, get a baby the fun way turn out to be moot, 
because it seem i have some kind of uterine condition--which meant i 
couldn't get pregnant, or even do an in vitro. bottom line, if i want 
a baby, i had to adopt." 

she pressed the button on the coffee grinder, send a blast of 
whirr through the kitchen. in seconds it was over and she was 
tap the batch into her braun. "so that's when i start on the 
attorney thing, got work over good try to adopt as a single mom, 
and finally heard about children of light." 

"the adoption organization? what do you know about them?" 

"tell you the main thing," she said, "they're the place that can make 
it happen." she reach over and poke kevin's tummy. "right, big guy?" 

sure look that way. what a cutie. 

by now the spacious living room had been turn into a mini film set, 
with two 35-mm panaflex camera set up, window blank out, lights and 
filter in place, and a video camera and monitor. have test the 
boom mike and the tape recorder, tony and sherry were ready. 

car announce to everybody that coffee was available, and i hand 
kevin over to marcy. then together we march into the living room. 

"okay," i told her, "we're go to be filming, but ignore that fact. 
just look into the back of the camera and talk to it as though it were 
me." 

"hey." she grinned. "you're dealing with a pro. this is my thing." 

i look around at the camera and the grips. "okay, guys. roll sound." 
there was a retort as the clap stick use for synch whacked out the 
start of the shoot. "scene one, take one, car grove interview." 

she proceed to hit the ground running, recount in great detail her 
story of many disappointments. she finally got to the point where she 
was try to adopt the baby of a woman in a memphis jail, and then 
even that fell through. 

"which was when my main lawyer, chuck, just gave up and recommend i 
hock the family silver, take a valium, and try this place call 
children of light. where you go when all else fails. so i gave them a 
call." 

"and what happened?" it sound too good to be true. "did they seem . . 
. in any way unusual?" 

she look at me, as though puzzle by the question. then she shrug 
it off. "well, first they try to get me to check into their 
clinic--it's this place up the hudson--to let them see if my 
'condition' could be cure somehow, use his special techniques." 

"his?" 

"goddard. dr. alex goddard. he's a kinda spacey guy, but he's the 
big-shot preside guru there." she remember the camera and turn 
back to it. "i told his staff i didn't have that kind of time, and 
anyway nothing could be done. they were pretty insistent, so i 
eventually end up talk to the man himself. he sort of mesmerize 
you, but i finally said, forget it, it's adoption or nothing. so he 
just sent me back to the peons. checkbook time." 

i stare at her, hungry for details, but she didn't notice, just 
pressed on. 

"the money they wanted, i have to tell you, was staggering. sixty 
thousand. and believe me, they don't give revolving credit." 

i thought about the figure. it was the highest i'd heard for get a 
baby, but it wasn't total off-the-wall. terrific baby don't drop 
from trees. 

car was still go strong. "it took me almost half a year to 
scrounge it together. a lot of credit lines got maxed. but when i 
finally did plunk down the loot, sure enough, i had kevin in less than 
three months. i don't even know where he came from. they took care of 
all that, but i do know it was probably out of the country, because of 
the blank ins form i signed. but then, who cares? with a deal this 
good, you don't press for details, right?" 

car grove had a mutual love affair with the camera. the footage was 
go to be fabulous. the only problem was, it sound like an 
"infomercial" for the adoption miracle wrought by this doctor name 
goddard. 

when the interview began to wind down, lose its punch, i suggest we 
call it a day. with the time push two o'clock, i want to get the 
film to the lab, get it developed, and take a look at the rushes. i 
also had a doctor's appointment, not to mention a meeting with david to 
bring him up to speed on what i was doing. but surely he was go to 
be pleased. the interview, with carly's honest intensity, would give 
the picture spine and guts. just as i'd hoped. 

you could always tell by the reaction of the crew. even roger drexel, 
who usually hid his thought somewhere in his scraggly beard, was 
letting his eyes sparkle behind his panaflex. scott was also grin 
as he struck the lights and cafiero rip up the power lines, now 
tape to the floor. everybody was in wrap mode, flushed with a great 
shoot. 

i follow car into the kitchen, where marcy was feed kevin some 
gerber applesauce. the time had come, i thought, to spring the next big 
question, out of earshot of the crew. 

"i hate to put you on the spot, but do you know any other women like 
you, single, who've adopt through children of light?" i decided to 
experiment with the truth. "god knows, depend on what happen in my 
own situation, i'm . . . i'm thinking i might even want to check them 
out for myself." 

"what do you mean?" she gave me a quick, concerned look. 

"maybe i'd like to talk to them about adopt too." i realize i was 
babbling, my usual prelude to obsessing. 

carly's worried gaze ease up a bit, but she start twist at her 
hair. 

"well, i might have another name. when my lawyer first told me about 
them, he gave me the name of another woman who'd adopt from them, and 
i talk to her a little about how they worked. she'd just gotten her 
baby, so i guess she was about six month ahead of me in the process. 
her name was . . . i think it was pauline or paula or something. she's 
probably not the kind of person who'd take their 'no disclosure' crap 
all that seriously. she was adopt a girl, and she lives somewhere on 
the upper west side." 

"any idea how i could find her?" 

"you know, she wrote kids' books, and i think she gave me her card. in 
case i ever need somebody to do some ya copy. let me go look in my 
rolodex. i file her card under 'y' for young adult. right. it'll just 
take a second." 

the woman, whose name was paula marks, live on west 83rd street. the 
business card, a tasteful brown with a weave in the paper, describe 
her as an author. the address included a "suite" number, which meant 
she work out of her apartment. 

"mind if i take down her phone number and address? i'd really like to 
look her up. to see if her experience was anything remotely like yours." 

car gaze at her fingernail a second. "okay, but do me a favor. 
don't tell her how you got her number." she bit her lip, stalling. 
"it's one thing for me to talk to you myself. it's something else 
entire to go stick my nose into other people's business." 

"look, i'll respect her privacy just as much as i respect yours." i 
paused, listen to what i'd just said. the promise sound pretty 
lame. i'd just film her, or hadn't she noticed? "look, let me call 
paula, see if she'll agree to be interview on camera. i'll keep your 
name entire out if it, i promise." 

she reach down and pluck kevin out of his high chair, kiss him on 
his applesauce-smeared cheek, then hug him. "sorry. guess i'm being 
a little paranoid. i shouldn't invite you here, then give you a hard 
time about what you're go to do, or not do. i can't have it both 
ways." 

in the ensue tumult and confusion of the wrap, i did manage to get 
one more item from car grove. the address and phone number of 
children of light. but i completely forgot the one thing i'd been 
meaning to ask about. that little amulet, with the strange cat's face 
and the lines and dot on the back. why was kevin wearing it? and by 
the time i got to the street, surround by the clamor of crew and 
equipment, it seem too inconsequential to go back and bother with. 




chapter two 


moving on, my next stress-point was to meet with my young boss, the 
afore-noted david roth, who was ceo and first operate kvetcher of 
applecore productions, a kinda-sexy guy whose heart was deep engaged, 
often unsuccessfully, with bottom lines. the issue was, i'd done 
today's shoot, the interview with carly, without trouble to secure 
his okay. without, in fact, telling him zip--the reason being i was 
afraid he wouldn't green-light the idea. now my next move was to try to 
convince him what i'd just done was brilliant. 

actually i like david a lot, and hope the occasional tangle we'd had 
over the film wouldn't stand in the way of a friendship. the truth is, 
you don't meet that many interesting, stable men in my line of work. 
our artistic goal weren't always in sync, but all the same, he'd done 
an enormous favor for somebody close to me and for that i'd vow to 
walk through fire for him. 

when i march into his cluttered, dim lit office, my mind still 
churn over carly's strange adoption story, what i saw sent my 
problem-detector straight into the red. there, sitting across from him, 
was nichola russo, a five-seven smoothie in a charcoal brioni 
double-breasted, the gentleman david sometimes refer to as nicky the 
purse. another land mine in my life. he operate off and on as 
applecore's "banker" when cash flow got dicey and real bank got 
nervous. it was an arrangement of last resort, since nicky's loan had 
to be service at two percent a week. do the numbers: he double his 
money in a year. i knew too that putt money out to independent 
filmmaker was part of nicky's attempt at a legitimate front; the real 
cash went onto the street of hell's kitchen, just outside our door, 
where he got five percent a week. and nicky's overdue notice were not 
sent through the mail. 

he also had a piece of a video distributorship, roma exotics, that 
reputedly specialized in . . . guess what. it was all stuff i try not 
to think about. 

i had a strong hunch what was under discussion. the $350,000 david had 
borrow to finish my picture. we'd gotten the loan three month ago, 
when cash was tight, and we both figured we could pay it back later in 
the year, after we got a backup cable deal (though i was ultimately 
hope for a theatrical distribution, my first). 

shit! what did nicky want? were we behind on the weekly juice? i'd 
sign on with david partly to help his bottom line. was i instead 
go to cause his ruin? 

at the moment he had his back to nicky, seem to be meditate out the 
window he loved, its vista being the grimy facade that line the far 
west of fifty-eighth street. his office, with its wide window and 
forest of freshly mist trees, told you he was a plant nut. outside it 
was early april, the cruelest month, but inside, with all the trees, 
spring was in full cry. the place also felt like a storage room, with 
piles of script stack around every pot. the office normally smell 
like a greenhouse, but now the aroma was one of high anxiety. 

david revolve back and look across the potted greenery, then broke 
into a relieved smile when he saw me. i could tell from his faraway 
stare that he was teeter on the verge of panic. 

"hey, come on in," he said. "nicky's just put a brand-new proposition 
on the table." 

david had a keen intelligence, cause me to sometimes wonder if he was 
in a line of work beneath him. (for that matter, maybe i was too.) he 
was dark-haired, trim, with serious gray eyes and strong cheekbones. 
this morning he was wearing his trademark black sweater, jeans, and 
white sneakers, a picture of the serious go-for-broke new york 
indy-prod hustler. he'd already made and lost and made several fortune 
in his youthful career. my only sexual solace since steve left was an 
occasional glance at his trim rear end. i also salute his fiscal 
courage. his congenital shortfall, i regret to say, was in the matter 
of judgment. exhibit a: nichola russo's funny money. 

"nicky, you remember morgan james, the director on this project." 

"yeah, we met. 'bout four month back." nicky rose and offer his 
manicure hand, a picture of old world charm. his dark hair was part 
down the middle and his brioni, which probably fell off a truck 
somewhere in the garment center, had buttons on the cuffs that actually 
buttoned. "how ya doing?" 

"hi." i disengaged myself as quick as possible. the slimeball. 

again, why was he here? the way i understood it, we'd sign a 
legitimate, ironclad note. nicky wasn't exactly the chase manhattan 
bank, but i assume he was a "man of honor," would live by any deal 
david had with him. "do we have some kind of problem?" 

"nah," nicky said, "i'm thinking of it more in the way of an 
opportunity. dave, here, show me some of your picture this morning, 
and it ain't too bad. got me to thinking. you're gonna need a video 
distributor. so maybe i could help you out." 

oh, shit and double-shit. i look at him, realize what he had in 
mind. "how's that? applecore already has a video distributor. we use--" 

"yeah, well, like i was telling dave, i got a nose this picture's gonna 
do some serious business." he try a smile. "whenever i see one of 
these indy things that don't add up for me, like this one, i always 
know it's a winner. what i'm telling you is, i think you got something 
here. he say you're figure on a cable deal, and maybe a theatrical 
release, but after that you gotta worry about video. i'm just thinking 
a way i could pitch in." 

pitch in? the last thing i need was some skin-flick wiseguy get 
his sticky hand on my picture. forget about it. 

"well, i don't really see how. i'm shoot this one by the book. i've 
got a standard screen actor guild contract, and everything is strict 
by the rules. if we're current on the loan, then . . ." i look at 
david, who appear to be running on empty. maybe, i thought, i didn't 
understand what was at stake. what had nicky said to him? this was a 
man who could make people disappear with a phone call to guy nickname 
after body parts. "look, let me talk to david about this. i don't know 
what--" 

"you two're just gonna 'talk' about it?" russo's penetrating eyes 
dimmed. "now that's a little disappointing, i gotta tell you, since i 
sent for my business manager, eddie down there in the car, hope we 
could reach a meeting of mind right here. sign a few things. roll that 
note i'm holding into a distribution deal and give everybody one less 
worry." he turn in his chair, bore in on me. "like, for instance, i 
checked out your location and i notice there ain't no teamster 
nowhere. all you got's a bunch of fuckin' mick scab driving them vans. 
now that can lead to circumstances. inadequate safety procedures. of 
course, that wouldn't have to be a concern if we was partner together. 
then you'd have good security. the best." 

i look at david, who seem on the verge of a heart attack. why was 
he letting this even be discussed? get in bed with nicky russo and the 
next thing you know he's got somebody hanging you out the window by 
your ankles. 

besides, ten to one the guy was bluffing, seeing if he could scare us. 

i refocused. "mr. russo, it may ease your mind to know that our 
security is manage by a former agent for the fbi. he was with them 
here in new york till about a year ago, when he came to us full time. 
his name is agent lou crenshaw. you're welcome to check him out. he's 
familiar with union issues, and he carry a .38. he also has plenty of 
friends down at 26 federal plaza. so if you have any lingering concern 
about our security procedures, why don't you run it by him?" 

the mention of lou seem to brighten david's listless eyes. he lean 
back in his chair and almost smiled. 

he had good reason. the favor he'd done for lou, and indirect for me, 
was enough to inspire eternal loyalty. lou would face off against half 
of hell's kitchen for david roth. 

"that ain't the point, exactly," russo said, shift uncomfortably. 
"thing is, roma could do good distribution for you. we work with a lot 
of people." 

"then why not submit a formal proposal? in writing. i'm in charge and 
that's how i do business. if your numbers work, then we can talk." 

"just try to be helpful." he glare at me, then seem to dismiss my 
presence. i disappear from his radar as though lift away by an 
alien spacecraft, and he turn back to david. "you know, dave, me and 
you've kinda drift apart lately. old friends oughtn'ta do that. we 
ought to keep more in touch. i think we get along okay." 

in other words, get this pushy broad out of my face. 

"it's just business, nicky," david said, try to conjure an empty 
smile. "business and pleasure don't always mix." 

yes! david, tell the creep to leave us alone. tell him. 

"doing business with me ain't a pleasure?" nicky russo asked, hurt 
filling his voice. he'd brought out a large havana and was rolling it 
in between his thumb and forefinger. "i figured we was best friends. 
_paisans_." 

"we're not _not_ friends, nicky. we've just got different goal in 
life. you know how it is." 

i work my way around behind his desk and glance out the window. the 
lingering day was beginning to cloud over, a perfect match for my state 
of mind. after this i had a late appointment with dr. hannah klein. i 
fear she was go to end my baby hopes. 

"yeah, well," nicky russo said finally, rising, "i gotta be downtown in 
a little while, so i guess we can talk about this later." 

"okay, sure." david made a shrug sign. like: women! what can you 
do? then he got up too. "look, nicky, let me chew on this. maybe i'll 
get back to you." 

"yeah, you think about it, all right?" he rose without a further word 
and work his way out the wide double doors, stumble through the 
ficu forest as he struck a match to his cigar. 

"david, don't sign anything with him. don't. i'll handle the teamster 
stuff if it come up. i know how to talk to them." 

"okay, okay, calm down. he was just seeing if he could push me. i know 
him. you call his scam with that talk about lou. by tomorrow he'll 
forget about the whole thing." he look at me, his eyes not quite yet 
back in focus. "thanks. you can say things to him i'd get cement shoe 
for. nicky's not really ready for people like you. he has this macho 
front, but he doesn't know how to handle a professional woman with 
balls." 

"you're welcome. i guess." balls? i adore those vulnerable male bits, 
but i prefer not to think of myself in those terms. truth was, nicky 
russo play a large part in my personal anxieties. "but i mean it. n. 
o." 

"i hear you," he said, sighing. then he snap back to the moment. "so 
where do things stand otherwise?" 

i'd come for an after-the-fact green light of the day's shoot, but 
already i was thinking about hannah klein. "david, i'm go to find 
out in about an hour whether steve and i are ever go to have a baby. 
but truthful i don't think i'm pregnant. i think it's over." it hurt 
to say it. he knew about steve and me--i'd written some language on 
maternity leave into my contract--and i think he was mildly root for 
us. or maybe not. 

"could be it's all for the best," he declared. he'd sat back down, 
picked up a pencil off his desk to distract himself, and was whirl 
it pensively, one of his few habit that made me crazy. "maybe you were 
destined to make movies, not kids." 

i listen to his tone of voice, knowing he often hid his real feelings 
with safe, sympathy-card sentiments. he rose to eloquence only when 
nothing much was at stake. he'd even sent me flower and a mea-culpa 
note twice as a makeup after we'd had a disagreement over costs and 
scheduling. and one of those times, i should have sent him flowers. 
sometimes i wonder why we work so well together. the truth was, we 
operate on very different wavelengths. 

some history to illustrate. over the past eight years, before i team 
up with david, i'd done three "highly praised" documentaries. but 
get to that point meant bust my behind for years and years at 
the lower end of the professional food chain. after nyu, i toil as a 
script supervise on pbs documentaries, about as close to grunt work as 
it comes. eventually i got a fling as a production assistant, 
assemble crews, but then the money dry up. (thank you, jesse 
helms.) whereupon i decided to try capitalism, working for three years 
as an ad on the soaps: first guide light, then as the world turns, 
then search for tomorrow. i can still hear the horrible music. then a 
connection got me a slot at a&e as a line producer. eight month later 
the series got canceled, which was when i decided the time had come to 
take my career into my own hands. i hock every last credit card, went 
to japan, and made a documentary. the result: i was an "overnight" 
success. men start address me by my name. 

my first film was about the impact of zen on japan business. as part 
of my research, i shave my head and live three month at a kyoto 
temple, eat bean curd three meal a day, after which i had enough 
credibility to land long interview with tokyo ceos. i then sold the 
edit footage to a&e. when it became a critical hit, they finance a 
second film, about the many gods of india and how they impact 
everything about the place. there, i also got caught up in the mystical 
sensuality of ragas, indian classical music, and took up the violin 
(one of my major professional mistakes). next i move on to mexico's 
southern yucatan to film a day in the life of a maya village for the 
discovery channel. they want me to add some footage from guatemala, 
but i scout the country and decided it was too scary. instead, i 
spent several month in haiti film voodoo rituals, again for a&e. 
and met steve. 

then one day i checked my bank account and realize that, financially 
speaking, i was a "flop d'estime." i was do the kind of work that 
do more for your reputation than your retirement plan. i decided to 
go more mainstream and see what happened. but to do that i need a 
commercial partner, a backer. 

ironically enough, when i first team up with david, he had 
bottom-line problem too, but from the opposite direction. he was busy 
disprove the adage that nobody ever lost money underestimate the 
taste of the america public. he knew something was wrong, but what? 

apparently, when he start out, somebody told him cable audience 
possessed an insatiable appetite for bare-skin-and-jiggle. hey, he 
figured, that stuff he could grind out in his sleep. his first, and 
last, epic in the skin genre was _wet t-shirt weekend_, whose title 
say it all. he explain the economics to me once, still baffle why 
the picture hadn't worked. he'd assume all you had to do was find a 
bunch of nineteen-year-olds who look like they're sixteen, go 
nonunion someplace down south with a beach, and take care the wardrobe 
trailer has nothing but string bikinis. "cost only a million-eight to 
make," he declared with pride, "but every penny is on the screen." 

he insist i watch it, perplexed that it was universally regard as a 
turkey. it was a painful experience, so much so i actually began to 
wonder if his heart was really in it. (the great schlockmeister 
secret think they're fellini; they're operate at the top of their 
form, not conscious pandering.) 

chasten financially, he decided to move into low-budget 
action-adventure. his efforts, most notably _virtual cop_, had car 
chases, blue-screen explosions, bucket of fake blood. somebody die 
creative in every scene. 

they did business in asia and southern europe, but he was dumbfound 
when nobody at hbo or showtime would return his calls. it gnaw at his 
self-esteem. 

that was the moment we found each other. he'd just conclude he need 
somebody with a quality reputation to give 

applecore an image makeover, and i'd realize i need somebody who 
knew more than i did about the mechanics of making and distribute 
independent films. 

we were an odd couple. i finally shook hand on the partnership after 
he cave in and agree i could do anything i wanted, so long as it 
look mainstream enough to get picked up by time-warner or somebody 
else legit. well, quasi-legit. we both agree on no more bikini and no 
more film about place that require cholera shots. it was something 
of a compromise on both our parts. 

thus far, though, we were get along. maybe luck was part of it, but 
_baby love _was still on schedule and on budget. and i already had a 
deal nearly in the bag with lifetime, the women's channel, that would 
just about cover the costs. everything after that would be gravy. 
again, hope hope. maybe not the theatrical release i'd been pray 
for, but good enough--so he had to smile and not give me a hard time 
about the money i'd just spent. had to, right? 

i took a deep breath. 

"david, i did a little extra shoot this morning that's kind of. . . 
outside the plan. but it's really important. want to hear about it?" 

"what! i thought you were finished with principal photography." he 
look disoriented, the deer in the headlights. hint of extra crew 
time always had that effect on him. "you're saying this wasn't in the 
budget?" 

"just listen first, okay?" like a politician, i avoid give him a 
direct answer. i told him about the interview with car and the reason 
for it. 

"nice of you to share the news with me." his eyes narrowed. "i think 
we've got some big-time communication issue here." 

"look, don't worry. i'll figure out how to save some money somewhere 
else." 

"morgy, before we continue this unnerve conversation, we've got to 
have a serious review of the matter of cash flow." he frowned, then 
went back to whirl the pencil, his hair backlighte from the wide 
window, his eyes focus on its stubby eraser as though he'd just 
discover a new strain of bacteria. "so let me break some news 
regarding the current budget." 

he put down the pencil, adjust its location on his desk, and look 
up. "i didn't want to have to upset you, since the picture seem to be 
go so well, but we've drawn down almost all our cash. i actually 
think that's why nicky was here today, sniff around, wanting to see 
a rough cut. he's got a keen nose for indy cash-flow trouble." 

"what are you saying?" it was unsettle to see david turning so 
serious. "are we--?" 

"i'm saying we can cover the payroll here, all our fixed nut, even 
nicky's vig, for maybe six more weeks, if you and i don't pay 
ourselves. of course, if we can get an advance on some kind of cable 
deal, that would tide us over more comfortable till this thing is in 
the can. but right now we're sailing pretty close on the wind. i've bet 
applecore on your picture, morgan. we can't screw this up." 

i swallow hard. i knew we were working on the edge, but i didn't know 
the edge was down to six weeks. 

"david, i'm all but ready for postproduction. i'm just thinking i may 
need one more interview. just a one-day shoot. i'm go to make this 
picture work. you'll see." 

he sighed. "all right, if you think it's essential, get the footage. 
maybe i can even shake another fifty out of nicky, if i string him 
along about the distribution deal--don't look so alarmed, i won't go 
through with it. anyway, i can tell he's impress with the picture so 
far. happy now?" 

no, i wasn't happy. what was i go to do if hannah klein had bad 
news? adoption? i finally was facing the fact i'd possibly been making 
a movie about myself all this time. like yeats, pen his own 
tombstone. "cast a cold eye, on life, on death. ." 

so why not give him the whole story? 

"david, if it turn out steve and i can't have a baby, i've begun 
thinking about try to adopt." there it was. more pain. "maybe i'm 
about to become the heroine of my own picture." 

he stare at me incredulously. 

"morgy, you of all people should know by now that adopt would take 
up all your energy, like a giant sponge. come on. i've seen your 
dailies. i got it, about how hard it is. you telling me now you didn't 
get it?" 

he was right. right than he realized. but then i thought again about 
car grove, who'd found kevin in no time at all, with zero hassles. 
the only trouble part was that it was all so mysterious. . . . 

after i left david's office, i remember i hadn't actually had lunch, 
so i grab two hot dogs with sauerkraut (okay, it was junk, but i 
secret love kosher franks) and a diet pepsi to go, from one of the 
striped-umbrella vendors, then hail a cab clutch the grungy brown 
bag. 

i was heading for hannah klein's office on the upper west side. and now 
i had another clock ticking in addition to the biological one. the big 
money clock in the sky was sudden on final countdown. 




chapter three 


it took only a few minutes for hannah klein's assistant, lori, to run 
the pregnancy test that confirmed my suspicion and settled my future. 
steve's and my final attempt, another intrauterine insemination (iui, 
med-speak for an expensive "turkey baster") with the last of his 
deposit, had failed. the end. the bitter end. 

"morgan," hannah declared, staring over her desk, her raspy new york 
voice bore through me like a drill, "given how this has all turn 
out, maybe you ought to just start considering adoption--if have a 
child still means that much to you." 

hannah klein was push seventy, a chain smoker who should have been 
dead a decade ago, and she unfailing spoke the truth. her gaze 
carry only synthetic solace, but i was probably her fifteenth patient 
of the day and maybe she was running low on empathy. oddly, though, 
sitting there in her office, miserable, i felt strange liberated. i 
adore the woman, a child of the holocaust, with layer of steel like a 
samurai sword, but i also love the thought of never again have to go 
through the humiliate of cower in her straight-backed office 
chair, like a so-so student on probation wait to receive my failing 
grade. 

it was now time to come to grip with what i'd known in my heart for a 
long time. god had made me a theoretically functional reproductive 
machine that just wouldn't kick over. translation: no cysts, fibroids, 
polyps, no ovulatory abnormalities. my uterus and fallopian tube were 
just fine, steve's sperm count were okay, but no baby was swimming 
into life inside me. 

sometimes, however, reality ask too much. it's not easy get your 
mind around the idea that some part of your life is over, finally over. 
the baby part. to admit that it's time to move on to plan b, whatever 
that is. such realization can take a while, especially if you've been 
living with high-level hope, no matter how irrational. 

"i frankly don't know what else we can do," she went on, project 
through my abyss of gloom. she was shuffle papers on her ash-strewn 
desk, white hair in a bun, fine-tuned grit in her voice. upper west 
side, a fifty-year fixture. she never wore perfume, but to me she 
always smell faint of rose mixed with smoke. earthy. "aside from 
try in vitro." 

we'd already discuss that, but it was definitely the bottom level of 
hell. besides, i was running out of money, and spirit. and now, with 
steve gone, the whole idea seem moot anyway. 

"so," she concluded, "barring that, we've done everything possible, run 
every test there is, both on you and on your . . ." 

"steve," i insert into her pause. she seem to deliberate block 
his name at crucial moments. maybe she thought i could have done 
better. maybe a nice solid dentist who own a suit instead of some 
freelance photo jock who show up for his sperm count wearing khaki 
safari shirts. well, let her deal with it. 

". . . and i can't find anything. sometimes, the body just won't 
cooperate. we may never know why. you've got to face that. but still, 
adoption is always an option." 

adoption. all along i'd told myself i didn't have the courage, or the 
heart. making movies is a full-time job, not leave time to go filling 
out form and jump through hoop for years and years. and to cap it 
off, i was just two years short of the big four-oh and financially 
struggling--hardly an adoption agency's profile of "ideal." 

but now, now i'd just discover car grove and the miracle of 
children of light. so maybe there really could be a way to adopt a 
beautiful child with no hassles. maybe it would simplify everything to 
the point i could actually pull it off. could this be my plan b? then 
what if steve came back? could we be a family finally? 

i wasn't use to being that lucky. and i still want hannah klein's 
thoughts, a reality test, which was why i pressed her on the point. 

"truthfully, do you think adopt is really a workable idea for 
somebody like me? would i--?" 

"morgan, i know you're making a film about the reality of the 
adoption process. we both realize it's not easy." she must have seen 
something needful in my eyes, because she continue on, add detail, 
letting the well-known fact convey the bad news. "as you're well 
aware, finding a young, healthy, america baby nowadays is all but 
impossible. at the very least it can take years." she was fiddling with 
some papers on her desk, avoid my eyes. then she stub out her 
cigarette in a gesture that seem intended to gain time. "and even if 
you're willing to take a baby that's foreign-born, there still can be 
plenty of heartbreak. that's just how it is." 

"i'd always thought so too," i said. "it's actually the underlying 
motif of my picture. but today i had an incredible experience. i film 
an interview of a single woman, early forties, who just adopt a baby 
boy. it took less than three month and he's blond and blue-eyed and 
perfect. i saw him, i held him, and i can assure you he's as america 
as peach cobbler. the way she tell it, the whole adoption process was 
a snap. zero hassle and red tape." 

"that's most exceptional." she peer at me dubiously. "actually more 
like impossible. frankly, i don't believe it. this child must have been 
kidnap or something. how old, exactly, was he when she got him?" 

"i don't know. just a few weeks, i think." 

her eyes bore in. "this woman, whoever she is, was very, very lucky. 
if what she say is true." 

"the organization that got the baby for her is call children of 
light," i went on. "that's all i know, really. i think it's up the 
hudson somewhere, past the cloisters. have you ever heard of them?" 

dr. hannah klein, i knew, was push three score and ten, had traveled 
the world, seen virtually everything worth seeing. in younger years she 
was reputed to have had torrid liaison with every notable europe 
writer on the west side. her list of conquest read like an old new 
yorker masthead. if only i look half that great at her age. but 
whatever else, she was unflappable. good news or bad, she took it and 
gave it with grace. until this moment. her eyes register undisguised 
dismay. 

"you can't mean it. not that place. all that so-called new age . . . 
are you really sure you want to get involved in something like that?" 

i found myself deep confused. were we talk about the same thing? 
then i remember car had said something about an infertile clinic. 

"frankly, nobody know the first thing about that man," hannah rage 
on. "all you get is hearsay. he's supposedly one of those 
alternative-medicine types, and a few people claim he's had some 
success, but it's all anecdotal. my own opinion is, it's what real 
physician call the 'placebo effect.' if a patient believe hard enough 
something will happen, some of the time it actually might. for god's 
sake, i'm not even sure he's board-certified. do yourself a favor and 
stay away. oftentimes, people like that do more harm than good." then 
her look turn inquisitive. "did you say he's providing children for 
adoption now? that's peculiar. when did he start that?" 

was i hearing some kind of professional jealousy slip out? hannah 
klein was definitely old school to the core. 

"he who?" i was try to remember the name of the doctor car had 
mentioned. "you mean--" 

"he say his name is . . . what? goddard? yes, alex goddard. he's--" 

my page chirped, interrupt her, and she paused, clearly annoyed. i 
look down to see a number i knew well. it had to be lou crenshaw, our 
aforementione security guard. he'd been off today, but there was only 
one reason he would page me: some kind of news from lenox hill. 

maybe it was good news about sarah! my hope soared. 

or maybe it was bad. please, dear god. 

"i'm sorry, dr. klein. i've got to go. right now. it could be a medical 
emergency." 

she nodded, then slid open the top drawer of her desk and hand me a 
list of adoption agencies. "all right, here, take this and look it 
over. i've dealt with some of them, letters of reference for patient 
like you." she must have realize the insensitive of that last quip, 
because she took my hand and squeeze it, the closest we'd ever come to 
intimacy. "let me know if i can help you, morgan. really." 

grasping the lifeless paper, i ache for steve all over again. times 
like this, you need some support. i finally glance down at the list as 
i head out. sure enough, children of light was nowhere to be seen. 

why not? i wondered. they'd found kevin, a lovely blond baby boy, for 
carly, a single woman, in no time at all. they 

sound like miracle-makers, and if there was ever a moment for 
miracles, this was it. shouldn't they at least have been given a 
footnote? 

i want to stalk right back and demand to know the real reason she was 
so upset, but i truly didn't want to waste a moment. 

lou had page me from a pay phone--he didn't actually have a cell phone 
of his own--and i recognize the number as belong to the phone next 
to the lenox hill hospital's third-floor nurses' station. when i try 
it, however, it was busy, so i decided to just get in my car and drive 
there as fast as i could. 

and as i battle the traffic down broadway, i realize that by 
divert my mind from my own trivial misery to the genuine tragedy of 
sarah, i was actually get my perspective back. that was one of the 
many things sarah had done for me over the years. 

all right. sarah and lou, who figure so largely in this, deserve a 
full-dress introduction, so obviously i should start by admit i'd 
known them all my life. lou was my mother's half brother, three years 
younger than she was, who came along after my grandfather widowed my 
grandmother in a freak tractor rollover and she remarry a lifelong 
bachelor neighbor. (i have old snapshot of them, and i can tell you 
they all were cheerless, beady-eyed america gothics.) i'd arrange for 
david to hire lou eight month earlier, not too long after i came to 
applecore. at that time he'd just taken early retirement from the fbi, 
because of an event that shook us all up pretty seriously. 

for some time now, lou's been a rumpled, wil loman figure, like a 
travel salesman on the skids, shirt fray at the collars, face 
tint from a truckload of early times. over the past fifteen years i'd 
watch his waist size travel from about thirty-three inch to 
thirty-seven, and i'd guess it's been at least a decade since a barber 
ask him if he need any off the top. natalie rose, his spirited, 
wiry wife of thirty-seven years, succumb to ovarian cancer seven 
years ago last september, and i know for a fact she was the one who 
bought his shirts, provided him with general maintenance. 

my first memory of him were when he was a county sheriff in a little 
burg call coleman, smack in the middle of texas, some fifty-five 
long, dusty mile from the ranch where i grew up. when i was about 
fourteen, i remember he gave up on that and move to dallas, there to 
enter training for the fbi. he eventually end up in new orleans, and 
then, after natalie rose pass away and he more or less fell apart, he 
got transfer to new york, considered the elephant graveyard of an 
fbi career. 

probably the reason i saw him as much as i did as a kid was because of 
my cousin sarah, his and rose's only child. she was six years younger 
than me, a lot when you're kids, but we were very special to each 
other, had a kind of bond that i've never really known with anybody 
since. we spent a lot of time stay at each other's house, me the 
almost-grown-up, and truthfully, i love her helplessly, like a little 
sister. i always want to think she need me, which can be the most 
affirm feeling in the world. i do know i need her. 

she was now lie in a coma, and the way she got there was the tragedy 
of my life, and lou's. to begin with, though, let me say sarah was a 
pretty blonde from the start, with sunshiny hair that define her as 
perpetual optimistic--and who wouldn't be, given the head she always 
turned. (i was--am--blond too, though with eyes more gray than her 
turquoise blues, but for me blond's always been, on balance, an 
affliction: sexist film producer assume, dammit, that you're a fail 
showgirl, or worse. i've actually dyed it brunette from time to time in 
hope of being taken more seriously.) sarah and i had always had our 
own special chemistry, like a composite of opposite to make a 
complete, whole human being. whereas i was the rational, left-brained 
slave of the concrete, she was a right-brained dwell in a world of 
what-might-be. for years and years, she seem to live in a dream 
universe of her own making, one of imagination and fanciful states. 

once, when she was five, lou hid in his woodwork shop for a month 
and made an elaborate cutaway dollhouse to give her at christmas. but 
when i offer to help her find little doll that would fit into it, 
she declared she only want angel to live there. so we spent the rest 
of the winter--i drop everything--hunting down christmas tree 
ornament that look like heavenly creatures. she'd swathe them in 
tinsel and sit them in balls of cotton she said were little clouds. 

i always felt that just being around her open my life to new 
dimensions, but her dream existence constant drove lou and rose to 
distraction. i think it was one of the reason he never got as close to 
her as he wanted, and his feelings about that were deep frustration, 
and hurt. he love her so much, but he could never really find a common 
wavelength. 

finally she came down to earth enough to start college, and eventually 
she graduate from smu in biology, then enroll at columbia for 
premed. by then she was interested in the workings of the brain, in 
alter states. i didn't know if it was just more pursuit of fantasy, 
but at least she was go about it professionally. 

anyway, when lou got transfer to new york, he was actually 
delighted, since it gave him a chance to be close to her. we all 
manage to get together for family reunion pretty often, though lou 
and sarah were talk past each other half the time. 

then tragedy struck. she was just finish her master's, and had been 
accept by cornell medical--lou was burst with pride--when he 
suggest they use her christmas break to drive back down to texas 
together, there to visit rose's grave. (i think he really want to 
show off his budding doctor-to-be to the family.) sarah was driving 
when they cross the state line into louisiana and were side-swiped by 
a huge mack eighteen-wheeler, which was in the process of jackknife 
across a frozen patch of interstate. they were thrown into the path of 
an oncoming car, and when the blood and snow were cleared, a 
six-year-old girl in the other vehicle was dead. 

the result was sarah decided she'd taken a human life. her own minor 
facial cuts--which lou immediately had repair with plastic 
surgery--somehow evolve into a major disfigure of her soul. all 
her mental eccentricities, which had been lock up somewhere when she 
start college, came back like a rush of demon loose from some 
pandora's box deep in her psyche. she drop out of school, and before 
long she was in the throes of a full-scale mental meltdown. she 
disappeared, and in the following two years lou got exactly one card 
from her, postmark in san francisco with no return address. he 
carry it with him at all times and we both studied it often, puzzle 
over the new age astrology symbol on the front. the brief note 
announce she'd acquire "divine energy" and was living on a new plane 
of consciousness. 

then eight month ago, the state department notify lou she was 
missing in guatemala. she'd overstay her visa and nobody knew where 
she was. 

so how did her "new plane of consciousness" land her in central 
america? was that part of the fantasy world she'd now return to? lou 
still work downtown at 26 federal plaza, but he immediately took a 
leave of absence and, though he spoke not a syllable of spanish, 
plunge down there to look for her. 

he was there a month, following false leads, till he finally 

ran into a reverend ben jackson, late of a self-styled protestant 
ministry in mississippi, who was one of the ardent new evangelical 
swarm over central america. the man mention that some chicle 
harvester in the northwest peten department of guatemala had found a 
young woman in an old dugout canoe on the guatemala side of the wide 
usumacinta river, near a tributary call the rio tigre, lodge in 
amongst overhang trees. she'd been struck on the head and presumable 
set adrift somewhere upriver, left for dead. she was now in a coma, 
rest at jackson's "jesus es el hombre" clinic, also located deep in 
the northwest peten rain forest. he had no idea who she was. 

lou rent a car and drove there, almost a day on unpaved roads. it was 
sarah. 

thus she was no long missing; she was now the apparent victim of an 
attempt murder. however, rather than being helpful, the local 
_policia_ appear annoy she'd been found, thereby reopen the 
matter. a blond _gringa _was out hike somewhere she had no business 
being in the first place and trip and hit her head on something. 
where's the crime? 

lou brought her back to new york, use a medevac plane supply by the 
state department, which, wanting no more cia-type scandal of america 
national being murder in guatemala, cooperate with great dispatch. 

after that, he need a job that would afford him time flexibility, so 
he could be at her bedside as much as possible. david was look for a 
security head, and i realize it would be a perfect match. since we 
didn't really need a full-time person, lou could spend a lot of hour 
at lenox hill, watch over sarah. 

she was just lie there now, no sign of consciousness, her body being 
kept alive with iv i'd go by to visit her as much as i could, and 
almost as bad as seeing the comatose sarah was seeing the grief in 
lou's eyes. he would sit there at the hospital every day, sometimes 
several hour a day, fingering an old engrave locket that carry her 
high-school graduation picture, just rubbing it through his finger 
like a rosary. we always made allowance when he want to take time 
off during one of our shoot schedules, figure maybe he was helping 
her. . . . 

as i turn east, to go crosstown, i thought again about sarah's 
condition. she and i look a lot alike, dense blond hair for one 
thing, but to see her now you'd scarcely know it, since hers had been 
clip down to nothing by the hospital. her cheekbones, however, were 
still strong, a quality now exaggerate by her emaciate state, and her 
eyes, which i had not seen in years, were a deep languid, turquoise 
blue. but seeing her lie there inert, being kept alive with tube and 
liquids, wearing pressure pants to help circulate blood through her 
legs, you'd scarcely realize she'd been a striking beautiful woman 
before the accident. 

what's worse, from what i knew, the horrific brain trauma that bring 
on a coma don't automatic go away when you regain consciousness. if 
the coma is the result of a head injury, and if it last more than a 
few days, the chance of regain all your mental function are up for 
grabs. lou once said there's a scale of eight stage to full recovery. 
people who have short coma can sometimes come out of them and go 
through those stage quickly--from initial eye movement to full mental 
faculties. others, who've been under for month or long can require 
years to come back. sometimes they can only blink their eyes to answer 
questions; sometimes they babble on incessantly. they can talk sense, 
or they can talk nonsense, incoherent fantasies, even strings of 
numbers. the brain is a complex, unpredictable thing. . . 

i always thought about this as i took the elevator up to lenox hill's 
third floor. the room where they kept sarah was paint a pale, sterile 
blue, and made even more depress by stark fluorescent lights. 
everything was chrome and baked-on enamel, including the instrument 
whose crt screen report her bodily functions. none of the 
instruments, however, had ever shown the brain activity associate with 
consciousness. 

lou was there when i walk in. he had a kind of wild in his eyes, 
maybe what you get when you mix hope with despair. we hug each other 
and he said, "she had a moment, morgy. she knew me. i'm sure she did." 

then he told me in detail what had happened. a nurse passing sarah's 
room had happen to notice an unexpected flicker on one of her 
monitors. she'd immediately informed the nurses' station, where 
instruction included lou's home number. 

he'd grab a cab and race there. when he got to her room, he pushed 
his way past the caribbean nurse and bent over her, the first time he 
had hope a conversation with her would be anything but a monologue. 

"honey, can you hear me?" 

there was no sign, save the faint flicker of an eyelid. 

it was enough. his own pulse rocketed. 

"where's the damn doctor?" 

while the physician was being summoned, he had a chance to study her. 
yes, there definitely was some movement behind her eyelids. and her 
regular breathing had become less measured, as though she were fight 
to overcome her autonomy nervous system and challenge life on her own. 

finally an overwork pakistan intern arrived. he proceed to fiddle 
with the monitors, do something lou did not understand. then without 
warning--and certainly attributable to nothing the physician did--sarah 
open her eyes. 

lou, who had not seen those eyes for several years, caught himself 
feast on their rich, aquatic blue. he look into them, but they did 
not look back. they were focus on infinity, adrift in a lost sea of 
their own making. they stare at him a moment, then vanish again 
behind her eyelids. 

he told me all this and then his voice trail off, his despair 
returning. . . . 

"lou, it's a start. whatever happen is bound to be slow. but this 
could be the beginning. . . ." 

we both knew what i was saying was perilous close to wishful 
thinking, but nobody in the room was under oath. for the moment, 
though, she was back in her coma, as though nothing had changed. 

i wait around until eight o'clock, when i finally convinced myself 
that being there was not do anybody any good. lou, i later learned, 
stay on till well past eleven, when they finally had to send security 
to evict him. 

okay, i've been holding out on the most important detail. the truth is, 
i hardly knew what to make of it. at one point when i was bend over 
sarah's seemingly unconscious face, her eyes had click open for just 
a fleeting moment, startle me the way those horror movies do when the 
"un-dead" sudden come alive. lou was in his chair and didn't see it, 
didn't notice me jump. 

the last thing i want to do was tell him about it, and i was still 
shiver as i shove my key into the toyota's ignition and head for 
home. she'd look directly into my eyes, a flicker of recognition, and 
then came the fear. she sort of move her mouth, try to speak, but 
all that came was a silent scream, after which her eyes went blank as 
death and closed again. 

she knew me, i was sure of it, but she had look through me and seen a 
reminder of some horror now lock deep in her soul. 




chapter four 


lou took the next few days off to spend by sarah's side, but nothing 
more happened. i repeatedly call him at the hospital to check on her, 
though it was becoming clear her brush with consciousness had only been 
an interlude. finally, i decided to show carly's rushes to david (he 
love them) and try to concentrate on postproduction for the rest of 
the week and the weekend, anything to make me not have to dwell on 
sarah's ghostlike, soundless cry of anguish. 

postproduction. when you're shoot a picture, you have to make all 
kind of compromises; but in post, with luck and skill, you can 
transform that raw footage into art. you mix and cut the take till the 
performance are taut; you loop in rerecorde dialogue where necessary 
to get just the right reading of a line; the foley guy give you clear 
sound effects where the production sound is muddy; and you balance the 
hue of red and blues, dark and lights till you get just the right 
color tone. 

all of the polish that came with post still lay ahead. the first 
step was to go through the rough cut and "spot" the film, marking 
place where the sound effects or dialogue would need to be replace 
with rerecorde studio sound--which meant several days, maybe weeks, of 
loop to edit out background noise and make the dialogue sound rich 
and crisp. for some of it, the actor would have to come back in and 
lip-synch themselves, which they always hate. 

it was daunting, to have to work back and forth between production 
sound track and loop tracks, blend alternate takes. you had to 
figure on only do about ten minutes of film a day, and then, after 
all that, you had to get the "opticals" right, the fade-outs and 
dissolve and, finally, the credit sequences. 

normally, once i start post, i would have exactly ten week to 
accomplish all that before the executive producer, david, got his hand 
on my picture. that was the prerogative that was part of the standard 
director's contract. now, though, i figured that was out the window. 
with the money go fast, i had to produce a rough cut and get the 
picture sold to cable in six weeks, period. 

but first things first. i deep need at least one more 
interview--carly's was too much of a happy one-note--which was why i 
need to shoot paula marks. it was now on for thursday, today. 

the appointment had taken all weekend, including a sunday brunch, to 
set up, but by that time i was sure this second mother would be 
perfect. she was a tall, willowy woman, forty-three, who had let her 
hair start go to gray. honesty, it was right there in her pale brown 
eyes. she wrote children's books, had never married--she now believe 
she never would--and had decided to adopt a child because she had a lot 
of extra love she felt was go to waste. different from car grove, 
maybe, but not in the matter of strength, and fearless independence. 

we arrive around ten a.m. to discover her apartment was in one of 
those sprawl prewar west side monoliths, thick plaster wall and a 
rabbit's warren of hall and foyers, legacy of an age before "lofts" 
and open spaces. terribly cramped for shooting. but paula agree to let 
the blue-jeaned crew move her old, overstuffed couch out of the living 
room, along with the piles of books that line the walls. 

another issue was makeup. at first paula insist she didn't want any. 
never wore it, it was deceitful, and she didn't want to appear on 
camera look like barbie. (small chance of that, i thought. a little 
war paint now and then might help your chance of landing a father for 
this child.) eventually arlene persuade her that camera lie and the 
only way to look like yourself is to enhance those quality that make 
you you. it was a thin argument, but arlene came from a long line of 
apparel proprietor who could unload sunlamp in the sahara. 

paula's adopt daughter rachel, who was a year and a half old, was 
running around the apartment, blond tresses flowing, drag a doll 
she had name angie. except the name came out "ann-gee." she was 
immediately adopt by the crew, and erica, the production manager, was 
soon teaching her how to play patty-cake. then rachel want to 
demonstrate her new skill at eat spaghetti. in five minutes she was 
cover head to toe in ragu tomato sauce. 

when the panaflex was finally rolling, the story paula spun out was 
almost identical to the one told by car grove. she'd spent hour with 
all the legal service recommend by nysac, new york singles adopt 
children, listen to them describe a scenario of delay and paperwork 
and heartache. it could be done, but it could take years. look, she'd 
declared, i'll cash in my ira, do anything, just give me some hope. 
okay, they'd replied, tighten your belt, scare up sixty big ones, and 
go to see children of light. we hear stories. . . . 

soon after she call them, the sky had opened. a new age physician 
and teacher there, a man with striking eyes name alex goddard, had 
made it happen. rachel was hers in just four months, no paperwork. 

sure, she declared, children of light was expensive, but alex goddard 
was a deep spiritual man who really took the time to get to know you, 
even practically beg you to come to his clinic-commune and go 
through his course of mind-body fertility treatment. but when she 
insist she just want to adopt, he obliging found rachel for her. 
how could she be anything but grateful? she was so happy, she want 
everybody in the world to know about him. 

as she bubble on, i found my attention wandering to rachel, who'd just 
escape from the crew keeping her in the kitchen and was running 
through the living room, singing a song from sesame street. something 
about the way she move was very evocative. 

where've i seen her before? then it dawn on me. her walk made me 
think of kevin. actually, everything about her remind me of kevin. 
were all kid start to look the same? god, i want them both. 

yeah, i thought, daydream of holding her, she's kevin all over 
again, clear as day. she's a dead ringer to be his old sister. it 
feel very strange. 

or maybe i was just seeing things. to some extent all baby look 
alike, right? that is, until you have one of your own. 

i had to swallow hard, to try to collect my thoughts. car and paula 
scarcely even knew each other. if rachel really was kevin's sister, 
they'd never know anything about it. 

incredible . . . it was just too big a coincidence. 

but still. . . and what about the film footage? show close-ups of the 
kids, and anybody not legal blind was go to see the similarity. . 
. . 

why would somebody give up two children for adoption? i found myself 
wondering. give up one was tragic enough. 

"cut." i wave at everybody. "take ten. we need to recharge here, take 
a break and stretch." 

paula was caught off guard, in the middle of a sentence, and she let 
her voice trail off, puzzled. 

"hey, i'm sorry rachel came barge in," paula finally said. "guess she 
broke everybody's concentration, huh?" 

"yeah, well, sometimes we all need to lean back and take a fresh run at 
things." i call to rachel, who came trot over, spaghetti sauce 
still on her face, and picked her up. i felt at a loss about what to 
do. tell paula her daughter had a younger brother in the village, and 
she might fall apart. "i was actually curious about something. do you 
know anything about rachel's birth mother?" 

"i don't want to know. it would disrupt my life. and my peace of mind." 
her eyes acquire a kind of sad mingle with anxiety. "i'm 
reconcile to the fact she probably got into some kind of trouble, may 
not have exactly been nobel prize material, but i'm a big believer in 
nurture over nature. that's why i write books for kids. so i think 
rachel's go to end up being a lot more like me than like her real 
mother." 

brave words. but i'll bet you anything the story of rachel's mother is 
a lot more complicated than you imagine. 

i glance at my watch, the hour push four-thirty. time to call it a 
wrap. besides, if we shot any more today, the crew would end up on 
overtime, and david was get increasingly nervous about my extra 
costs. 

i also need a little downtime to reflect. 

"look, i think i've got enough footage to work with for now. let me 
just get the release sign take this film downtown, and get it 
processed. maybe we can come back for another shoot when i figure out 
exactly where this is going." 

"anytime. just give me some notice and i'll try to have the place 
clean up more next time." 

"don't worry. i like it to look real. just sign the release and i'll 
take it from there." i was about to set rachel back on the floor when 
something caught in my sweater. look down, i realize it was a tiny 
charm bracelet, with two little medallion on it. one was a little red 
plastic likeness of pocahontas, the disney character, and the other was 
a silver face of a cat, long and stylized. and on the back, those 
curious lines and dot again, only these were arrange different from 
those on the one carly's boy kevin had. 

"paula, what's this? this cat. where'd you get it?" 

"oh, that." she smiled. "she was wearing it when i got her, on a little 
silk cord around her waist, under her diaper. they told me it was a 
gift from her real mother, a keepsake. sort of break your heart, but 
the way they said it, you want to keep it forever. . . ." 

at that moment erica was just plug the phone back in, and the 
second she did, the old, black panasonic cordless began to ring. 

"hang on a sec," paula said. "let me get that. my agent is supposed--" 
she'd picked up the phone and was plop back onto the couch. "hi." 

then her look turn blank. "no, of course not." she fell into an 
uncomfortable pause, look around at everybody. then she continued. 
"nobody's contact me." she halt again, her face white, and stare 
directly at me. i abrupt sense that i was the topic of the 
conversation. "sure i'm sure. . . . yes, i remember signing. . . . 
don't worry. i'd have no reason to. . . . okay, sure, i'll let you 
know." 

she click off the phone and look up with startle eyes. "it was 
somebody who said they work for children of light. she want to know 
if you'd contact me." her face collapsed. "you. she ask me 
specifically about _you_. by name. how did--?" 

"i have no idea." my hand were grow cold. had car told them about 
me? why would she do that? "anyway, you handle it okay." 

which made me wonder. if children of light was such a perfect 
organization, why was paula so frightened she immediately felt 
compel to lie, to swear she hadn't broken their rules? 

"right." her composure was slow coming back. "look, now that i think 
about it, why should they care? it doesn't make any sense. they got 
their money." she turn to me. "let me have that release." 

she seize the paper and endorse it with a flourish. 

my pulse was still in overdrive, but i hug her, then signal the 
crew that shoot was over for the day. 

"okay, everybody. time to wrap." 

the gang immediately began striking the lights and rolling up 
electrical cords. they would take the equipment back downtown and 
deliver the film to the lab, while i would head home. it had been a 
long day and lot of thinking was needed. besides, it was start to 
rain, a dismal spatter against paula's grimy windows, as the gray 
spring afternoon had begun darken toward sullen evening. 

"listen, i enjoy this." paula had taken rachel in her arms and was 
stroke her blond hair. "i really love talk about her. she's 
change my life." 

i gave her another hug. "you're great. and you're go to be wonderful 
in the film." if i use her. the whole thing was get unnerving. 
"you have no idea how much you've helped." then i said good-bye to 
rachel, who respond with a perfect "bye, bye" through her haze of 
spaghetti sauce. 

okay, get the superintendent. crank up the freight elevator. get out of 
here. 

scott ventri, key grip, took charge of handle the gear, dictate 
which equipment got loaded on first. i watch long enough to make sure 
everything was go okay, and then i join arlene, old friend and 
queen of outrageous makeup, on the other elevator. 

"you notice it?" she whispered. the door had just closed. 

"notice what?" i knew full well what she was talk about. but it just 
felt too bizarre. 

"those kid could almost be twins. that little boy last week, and this 
girl. they look just alike. it's spooky." 

"guess their parent couldn't figure out what was cause those 
pregnancies. so they just kept have more babies." i decided to try to 
insert some humor, deflect the conversation. "maybe we should tell 
paula and carly." 

"very dumb." arlene bit at a long, red, false fingernail, a perennial 
habit for as long as i'd known her. "we should mind our own business, 
that's what we should do." 

"works for me. but it also prove we were smart not to shoot any 
footage of the kids. the whole world would realize something's funny." 
then i had an idea. "want to come downtown to my place after we unload? 
have some deep thought over what all this means?" 

first the kids, then the call. what was this guy alex goddard, whoever 
he was, up to? definitely time to talk to somebody. . . . 

"gee, i'd love to," arlene was saying, "but i can't. i gotta go out to 
kew garden for my mom and dad's anniversary tonight. their 
thirty-fifth, can you believe? of course, i was a very late baby." she 
blink her dark, languid eyes, as though rehearse the line for a 
downtown club. 

"a miracle of modern fertility science, right?" shit. arlene, i need 
you. 

"right." she giggled, then seem to study the flash lights on the 
elevator's control panel. "god, those kids, they're too good to be 
true. i'd love to have one like that." she impatient pound the 
number one a couple of times, perhaps hope to speed our creaky 
descent. "i can get bonke every night of the week, but i can't get a 
serious boyfriend. new york's club aren't exactly brim with the 
vine-covered-cottage-and-picket-fence type. and as for the pickings at 
work, given the kind of pictures david makes, forget it. last thing i 
need is some twenty-year-old pothead who think with his wang." 

"i'm afraid i'm not helping you much with this one." i'd cast _baby 
love_ mostly with off-broadway unknowns. the actress mary gregg was a 
veteran of joseph papp's original public theater, the experimental 
enterprise downtown. the few male parts all went to guy who were 
either gay or married. 

"oy, what can you do, right? if it happens, it happens." arlene watch 
the door begin to stutter open as we bump onto the lobby level. then 
she zero in on me. "you really want a kid too, don't you? i mean, 
that's why you did this script, right? which, by the way, is great. i 
mean the script." 

"i think most women do, down deep." 

she smiled. "well, if i ever have one, it's go to be the 
old-fashioned way. it's a heck of a lot cheap than adopting." she was 
heading out, into the front foyer. "not to mention more fun get 
there." 

on that i definitely had to agree. 

the lobby's prewar look was gray and dismal, and as we emerge onto the 
street, the rain had turn into a steady downpour. lou was off again 
today, down at the hospital with sarah, so i'd engaged a doorman from a 
new co-op across the street to keep an eye on our vans. a crisp twenty 
had extract his solemn promise to do just that. at the moment, 
however, he was nowhere to be seen. proving, i suppose, david's theory 
that we need our own security guy at all location shoots. 

lou, i thought, i hope you're finally get through to her. 

"no limo, but at least we get first call on the vans," arlene observed, 
her voice not hiding the sarcasm. "just once i'd 

like to work for somebody who had serious vip transportation." 

"david would walk before he'd get a limo." 

we were head down the street, me digging out my keys, when i notice 
the man standing in the rain. he was just behind our lead van, a 
three-year-old gray ford, wait for us. 

my first thought was he must be connected to nicky russo, david's 
wiseguy banker, here to bust my chop over the teamster issue. screw 
him. just my luck he'd send somebody the very day lou was not on hand. 
but then i realize i'd guess wrong. the man was more hispanic than 
italian. he also was short, solid built, late fifty maybe, with 
intense eyes and gray hair that circle his balding pate like the dirty 
snow around a volcano's rim. as he move toward us, i thought i 
detect something military in his bearing, not so much the crisp 
of a soldier but rather the authoritative swagger of an officer. well, 
maybe a retired officer. 

"the paper on your windshield say you are film a movie," came a 
voice with a definite spain accent. no greetings, no hiya, how're you 
doin'? just the blunt statement. then, have establish what was 
already clear to all at hand, he continued. "it say the title is _baby 
love_. why are you making this movie here?" 

that was it. i glance at arlene, who'd turn white as a sheet. you 
get a lot of onlooker around a location shoot, but not too many who 
challenge your right to exist, which was exactly what was coming 
through in his menace tone. 

i hand arlene the keys. "here, go ahead and open up. i'll handle 
this." 

then i turn back to him. "what you saw in the windshield of the van 
is a new york city film board permit. that's all the information we are 
require to provide. if you read it, you know everything i'm oblige to 
tell you." i return his stare. "however, if people ask nicely, i'm 
happy to answer their questions." 

"are you making this movie about a person in this building? your other 
film have been documentaries." 

god help me, i thought. is this what my fan are like? 

then it hit me. i don't know how i'd miss the connection, but now it 
just leapt out. first the phone call, then this hood. somebody was 
track me. 

"i'm scout locations," i lied, feeling a chill go through me. "we're 
second unit for an action film, shoot some prep footage for the 
producers. do the name arnold schwarzenegger mean anything to you?" 

"then why is the film about babies?" 

"that's meant to be a joke. remember the movie _twins_? it's a joke 
title. do you understand?" 

at that moment, paul nulty came barge out the door with a huge klieg 
light, follow by several other member of the crew carry sound 
gear. our cordial tete-a-tete was about to be disrupted. 

my new hispanic friend saw them and abrupt drew up. that was when i 
notice the shoulder holster under his jacket, contain some sort of 
snub-nosed pistol. 

jesus, i thought, this must be what some kind of hire killer looks 
like. that gun's not a prop. 

"i think you are lying." he closed his jacket and, ignore my crew, 
bore in relentless on me, his eyes dead and merciless. "that is a 
big mistake." 

it was the first time in my life i'd ever stood next to a man who had a 
gun and was deep tick at me. he'd want me to see his piece, just 
to make sure i took him seriously. he wasn't threaten me, per se. 
rather he was letting me know how strong he care about what i was 
doing. 

well, damn him, but i still was scared. i might have manage to bluff 
nicky russo, but he was a guy who operate by an age-old set of 
sicilian rules. this thug didn't strike me as the rule-book type. 

hand shaking, i pull out my cell phone, flick it open, and punch 
in 911. 

"listen, if you're threaten me with a gun, i'm calling the cops. 
whatever problem you have with the new york film industry, you can 
explain it to them." 

new york's police emergency number was still ring as he abrupt 
turn and strode away. 

i click the phone shut and move to get out of the way as a trolley 
loaded with more gear was roll past me down the sidewalk. 
unfortunately, i also took my eyes off him for a second, and when i 
look up again, he seem to have disappear into the rain, though i 
did notice somebody who could have been him get into a long black car 
well down the block and speed off toward broadway. 

"what did that creep want?" arlene asked, coming back with the keys. 

i was only slow return to reality, and it took me a few moments to 
form a coherent answer through all the adrenaline surge into my brain. 

"i . . . i don't know. but i think i'd better warn everybody to keep an 
eye out for strangers. he's . . . he's wound a little tight, to put it 
mildly." i was still shaking, which she fortunately fail to notice. 
at that point, there seem no great reason to spook her with mention 
of the gun. 

"boy, he wasn't just some homeless junkie," she said. "he look like a 
heavy in one of david's old action pictures. all he need was a 
mack-10." 

"right." jesus, arlene, i think he might have had one. "so let's get 
moving." 

as i watch the van being loaded, slow calm down, i kept 
thinking about him. he was undoubted connected to the phone call, but 
why would anybody be so worried about what i was doing? i couldn't 
think of any serious reason. 

half an hour later we were all head downtown. along the rain-swept 
street the "all beef" hot-dog vendor cower under their 
red-and-yellow striped umbrellas, while depart office workers, 
briefcase perch above their head as makeshift protection, scurry 
along the edge of building searching for cabs. while arlene continue 
to chat nonstop, i try to do a little mental processing. and my mind 
kept drift back to the sight of little rachel, and kevin. what 
perfect kids. the way she was running. . . . 

hey, wait a minute. how could they be siblings? brother and sister? 
rachel was almost exactly half a year old than kevin. biology didn't 
work that way. no way could they be related, but still . . . they 
look so alike. 

i realize arlene hadn't put it together about the ages. the 
brother/sister theory made absolutely no sense. those kid were born 
six month apart. 

if that wasn't strange enough, why did they both have those tiny cat 
medallion with the lines and dot on the back? which were actually 
kind of creepy, more like sacred amulet than little toys. 

talk to lou. he might have some insights. 

no, better yet, go to the source. children of light. call alex 
goddard's adoption agency or clinic or whatever it is and make an 
appointment. 




chapter five 


i was feeling a bit off center that evening, but i explain it away as 
mental overload, the rain, and the imply threats. that diagnosis got 
revise the next morning when i awoke with a mind-numbing headache, 
chill alternate with a mild fever, and my chest feeling like it was 
caught in a compactor. it was a so-called common cold, but there was 
nothing common about my misery, which was truly exceptional. 

i made a cup of echinacea tea and then wash down 2000 mg of vitamin c 
with some age orange juice from my fridge, after which i took a 
couple of tylenol, put on yesterday's jeans, and head uptown to work. 
i also treat myself to a cab. 

when i settled into the clutter corner room that was my office, i 
told myself this was not a day to make any big decisions. just stick to 
matter that require nothing more than autopilot. 

the first thing i did was call lou to check on sarah (no change), and 
then i told him about my hispanic visitor. he made concerned sound and 
promise to accompany me on any further location shoots. 

next i pull out my date book and punch in a phone number i'd 
scribble in the back. i'd gotten it when i was winding up my interview 
with car grove. 

"children of light," said an unctuous voice. "this is ramala." 

i hesitate a moment before give my name. they already knew who i 
was; ramala or somebody had call paula mark and ask about me. me. 
what would she do when she heard it was yours truly in the flesh? 

i try to take a deep breath, working around the feeling my lung were 
on fire, and identify myself. 

ramala received the information as though she'd never heard of me. 
maybe she hadn't. then i ask for an appointment with alex goddard. as 
soon as it was convenient. 

"he leaves his saturday open," she said, more of the smiley voice, "so 
i could make a special appointment for you tomorrow. would ten a.m. be 
all right?" 

her accent was the kind of delhi colonial-ruling-class you associate 
with expensive silk sari and ruby bracelets, yet at the same time her 
voice had an overlay of that melodious, touchy-feely unctuous you 
hear on relaxation tapes. i half expect her to next say, inhale 
deep and feel the love flowing through the universe. in any case, she 
couldn't have sound more open and forthcoming. 

i had to remind myself immediately that it wasn't true. given the 
inquisitive phone call to paula marks, children of light was an 
organization that deep cherish its privacy. presumable they had a 
reason, and that reason didn't necessarily have to be sinister, but 
still, i had every reason to think they were upset about me and it made 
me paranoid. and now alex goddard immediately had time for a "special 
appointment." 

"ten o'clock will be fine," i said, just barely croak the words out 
of my chest. 

she gave me directions for reach the riverdale clinic, call 
quetzal manor, and hung up. i felt so miserable i could barely remember 
afterward what she'd said, but fortunately i'd taken notes. 

quetzal manor. an odd choice for a name, i'd thought. 

some kind of bird sacred to the maya indian of central america. but 
then paula had mention at one point that he was very interested in 
indigenous third world herb and remedies. so maybe it fit. 

but still, one big puzzle kept coming back to haunt: how do you produce 
perfectly healthy sibling six month apart? (i actually call car 
and paula back to verify the ages.) the more i thought about kevin and 
rachel, the more i realize they were so unmistakable related. 

puzzle over that, i began to wonder if maybe i was on the verge of 
uncover a blockbuster documentary. could we be talk something 
approach science fiction here? making documentaries, you're always 
on the lookout for the unexpected, the fresh. so how about an 
organization that could obtain beautiful caucasian baby seemingly at 
will, including peas-in-a-pod born a few month apart? i was already 
frame a pitch to david in my mind. 

anyway, the rest of the day, while i was busy battle my cold with 
antihistamine and lot of hot soup, i mount a major phone inquiry 
just to make sure all the rule on adoption hadn't somehow change when 
i wasn't looking. they hadn't. first off, to get a child in three or 
four months, you'd almost certainly have to go with foreign adoption. 
china was everybody's flavor of the month, because they favored old 
parent and also because the one-child-per-family policy there had 
end up produce a wide-scale abandon of girl (who were all 
those precious boys go to marry? i often found myself wondering). 
however, the shift politics there made the process very unreliable. 
a few months? don't even think about it. 

pressing on, i satisfy myself that the country-specific organization 
that found baby in the emerge parts of the world all still work 
the same. cradle of hope specialized in orphan russia kids. children 
and families, inc., provided adoption for equador children. 
international adoption assistance, inc., handle brazil orphans. but 
they all were still fussy, and they could take ages. how about a 
brand-new healthy baby in just a few months? i'd ask. some kind of new 
fast track? the question was always taken as a joke. . . . 

i would be driving up to quetzal manor in my old toyota, and i dearly 
wish steve could somehow materialize and be with me. in his absence, 
however, i convinced lou to come along. i figured the change of scene 
would do him good, and i also want the security of have him with 
me, after the threaten phone call to paula and the hispanic thug 
who'd accost me outside her apartment building. besides, it'd just be 
a couple of hours. 

the next morning, as we trek up riverside drive, then the henry 
hudson parkway, the sky was a flawless blue and the wide hudson seem 
like an ardent highway leading into the heart of america. still in 
elevated spirits over sarah's momentary brush with consciousness, lou 
had noticeable less of a hangover than was usual most mornings. maybe 
he was look forward to a little mental r&r. for my own part, i felt 
my curiosity growing. i'd gone to a lot of appointments over the years, 
but rarely did i suspect the person i was go to see already knew 
more about me than i knew about them. 

after we cross the henry hudson bridge, we left the highway and 
head down a service road that led toward the river. then there was an 
imposing gate, open, and a tree-shrouded driveway. finally the place 
loom in front of us. 

the physical appearance of quetzal manor was a study in europe 
grandeur, translate with a few extra frills from the new world. car 
had told me it had once been a carmelite convent, date from sometime 
in the middle of the last century, and it was a monument to church 
authority, with endless arch of cut stone, turrets, gargoyles. as we 
were motoring to the end of the long cobblestone drive, i felt as if i 
was approach some gothic movie set. given its hover sense of 
regal authority, the place could easily have been a castle, but it 
seem more like a brood homage to medieval torture. let me just say 
it was truly magisterial, yet also more than a little creepy. 

as we park under a huge oak tree in front, i survey the facade, 
try to marshal my strength. enough of my cold still linger that i 
didn't feel as if my mind was working on all cylinders, and for a 
moment i merely sat looking, try to breathe. 

"want me to go in with you?" lou ask finally. he was examine the 
building suspiciously, like a detective survey a crime scene. 

i want him with me and then again i didn't. i long for the company, 
a protector, but i didn't want the complications, more things to 
explain inside. finally i made a snap decision. 

"why don't you take a stroll around the grounds?" i suggested. "commune 
with nature. the fresh air will do you good. this can't take long. 
mainly i just want to get some literature and try to gain a feeling for 
the place." 

that wasn't entirely, or even partly, true. what i really want to 
find out was threefold: how did they manage to get beautiful healthy 
caucasian baby for two single women in just a few months; how could 
those baby be only six month apart in age and still obviously be 
siblings; and (this was where my feelings got complicated) could they 
get a baby for me the same way, never mind how they did it. it was the 
third thing that actually bother me the most, since i was far from 
sure i want to be a part of whatever was go on. 

lou just shrug and lean back in his seat. "take as 

long as you like. i'll just wait here in the car. i'm not the nature 
type." 

that was certainly the case. 

i walk across the cobblestone to an arch entryway that had no 
door. i wonder at this--most convent are like a fortress--and then i 
realize the front door had been removed, leave only its ancient 
hinge still bolt into the stones. perhaps it was intended to be a 
symbol of openness, inviting you in. 

there was no sign of anybody--the saccharine-voiced ramala was not on 
hand to greet me--so i just head on down a wide hallway, past a table 
of brochures. the place had been decorate with expensive good taste: 
tapestry all over the stone walls, perfect persian rugs, classic 
church statuary--all of it calling forth powerful feelings from deep in 
the psyche. 

then i enter a vast interior courtyard, where a central fountain 
splash cheery in the midday light. the courtyard was circle with a 
picturesque gallery of cells, all with massive wooden doors, most 
likely rooms once inhabit by chaste sisters. 

the place did seem to be a clinic-commune now, just as paula had said. 
not nun this time around, but rather new age acolyte whose taste ran 
more to secular music than to religious chants, as witness the 
cacophony of sound that waft out from several of the cells. only it 
wasn't any kind of conventional music; it seem a mixture of japan 
flute, north indian ragas, africa drumming. i like the ragas, even 
recognize my favorite, "bhairavi." 

then i spotted something that rivet my attention. at the back of the 
courtyard, just past a final wooden door, stood a huge south indian 
bronze statue, about five feet high, of the dance shiva. it appear 
to be preside over the arch way that led out into a dense natural 
garden behind the building. 

i walk across the cobblestone to examine and admire it. it seem an 
odd item to find here in the courtyard of a once-cloistered convent. i 
was so enthrall i fail to hear the door behind me open. 

"do you find my shiva interesting, ms. james?" said a soothe voice, 
just barely audible above the chirp of birds. i think i caught a 
breath in my phlegm-locked chest, but then i turn to see a tall man 
dress in casual chino and a dark sweater. he was trim, look to be 
in his early sixties, with a mane of salt-and-pepper hair and lean 
features more craggy than handsome. but his eyes were everything, 
telling you he own the space around him, own in fact, the air he 
breathed. it had to be alex goddard. 

"yes," i answer almost before i thought. "it just seem to be a 
little out of place here." 

i wonder if he was go to introduce himself. then i realize that 
when you're use to being the master of a private domain, you probably 
never think to bother with such trivial formalities. everybody know 
who you are. 

"well," he said, his voice disarming benign, "i suppose i must beg to 
differ. may i suggest you consider this shiva for a moment and try to 
imagine he's a real god?" 

"he is a real god" i said immediately feeling patronized. nothing make 
me angry faster. "in india, he's--" 

"yes," he said "i know you did a film about india--which i found quite 
extraordinary, by the way--but why wouldn't the shiva fit right in 
here? you see, he's a very modern, universal figure. he incorporate 
everything that exist in the contemporary world. space, time, matter, 
and energy. as well as all of human psychology and wisdom." 

"i'm aware of that," i said sense my pique increase. we were not 
get off to a great start. 

"yes, well." he seem not to hear me. instead he start putt on 
the leather jacket he'd had slung over his shoulder. "notice that shiva 
has four arms, and he's dance with one foot raised. he's also 
standing inside that great circle of flame, a sort of halo encompass 
his whole body. that circle stand for the great, all-embracing 
material universe, all of it. dark and light, good and evil. he know 
and control everything." 

hey, i realized, this guy's got some kind of identity thing go with 
this ancient indian god. 

he continue as he zip up the jacket. "shiva has four arms because--" 

"let me tell you," i said, interrupt him. he look startled, 
clearly not accustomed to a woman meeting him on his own ground. "he 
has four hand because he has a lot to do. that little drum in his 
upper right summons things into existence. and there in his upper left 
he hold a fire that destroys." 

goddard was examine me curiously, but i just stare back and 
continued. 

"his lower right hand is held up in a kind of benediction, as if to 
say, 'find your peace within,' and the lower left points down at his 
feet, where one foot is plant on the back of that repulsive little 
dwarf there, the human ego. crush the ego and be free. the other foot 
is lift to signify spiritual freedom." 

"you seem to know the shiva well." he broke into a grudging smile, as 
though we'd just met. chalk up round one as a draw. "i'm glad you came, 
ms. james. i'm a great admirer of your work and i especially want to 
provide your orientation personally. it's a genuine pleasure to meet 
you at last." 

at last? i took his proffer hand and stared. all the question i'd 
been brood over for the past week sort of disappear into a memory 
file somewhere. instead all i could do was focus in on him. 

meeting car and paula's miracle worker in the flesh made me recall 
something aldous huxley once observed. he declared that the kind of 
man, and they are almost always men, who can control other with his 
mind needs to have certain quality the rest of us can only envy. of 
course he has to be intelligent and have a range of knowledge that can 
be use to impress people, but most of all, he has to have a will of 
iron, an unswerving tenacity of purpose, and an uncompromising 
self-confidence about who he is, what he wants. this means a slightly 
remote manner, a glittering eye, and a sympathetic gaze that bore in 
deep on you one minute, then seem off in another realm, focus on 
infinity, the next. perhaps most important of all, his voice must be 
that of a pied piper, a soft yet penetrating instrument that acts 
directly on the unconscious of his listeners. 

even though he was do a casual number with me, my first impression 
of alex goddard was that he perfectly embody all those qualities. i 
also sense a false note. what was it? maybe he was being just a little 
too casual. 

"if you're here about do a film," he began, "please be aware we do 
not encourage publicity. if you've come because of your infertility, as 
ramala said you mention in your call, then i welcome you with open 
arms." 

well, he knew how to cut to the chase. and after his phone call to try 
to intimidate paula marks, i was well aware he didn't "encourage 
publicity." but now i also realize he wouldn't be overly interested in 
my new idea of someday do a documentary on this place. but then a 
lot of people say no at first and then come around. 

"i was actually interested in neither," i said, feeling my sinus 
about to close down permanently. "i was actually hope to find out 
about your adoption service, how it works." 

"ah," he said, his eyes shift from intense scrutiny to somewhere 
lost in the ozone, "that's not something i handle personally. in any 
case, you first must come and participate in our program. then, if we 
fail to achieve your objectives, we can take the adoption matter under 
consideration." 

"i think i'd like to hear about it anyway." i took a deep breath, again 
grope for air. "for instance, where and how you get the children you 
place." 

"i see," he said calmly, as though my question were about the weather. 
then he secure his coat tighter. "i'm thinking, how would you like to 
take a short walk? down to the river. we could get to know each other 
better." 

i just nodded, not look forward to the harsh wind that would assault 
my inflamed sinuses. but maybe i was get somewhere. 

as we start out through the stone archway and into the rear garden, 
which seem to extend for acres, he continued. 

"you seem to have a lot of question about what i'm do here. so let 
me try and put my effort into perspective. as i like to point out to 
women when they first come here, we in the west are making do with only 
half the world's medical knowledge. we ignore all of the east. there's 
also the wisdom of the indigenous people here in the western 
hemisphere, the native americans. who are we to say they don't have a 
lot to teach?" he smiled, as though embarrass to be passing along 
such a commonplace. "for example, western medical practice, virtually 
until this century, consist mainly of use leech to drain away 
'humors' in the blood. at the same time, the indigenous people of this 
continent knew more about the curative powers of plants, even drugs, 
than europe ever dream of. yet they were deem savages." 

i wasn't sure where he was leading, but the supreme self-confidence 
with which he spoke had the effect of sweeping me along. the engaging 
eyes, the voice, the well-used designer jacket, it all worked. he was 
good, very good. 

"so you see," he went on, "what i've try to achieve here at quetzal 
manor is to integrate the knowledge of east and west, ancient and 
modern." 

"so what, exactly, do you--?" 

"well, first let me explain that i studied in the far east for over a 
decade, until i understood how to control the energy flow in the body, 
your chi. then i move to central america, where i learned all that is 
current known about native america practice and medicines. i still 
have a special place there, where i carry out pharmacology research 
on the rare plant of that area, study their effects on human 
fertility, on the origin of life. i have no time to waste on disease 
and degeneration." 

we were well into his eden-like rear garden now, which had lot of 
herb and was also part orchard. there were apple tree and other fruit 
tree i couldn't readily identify, all just start to show their 
first buds. when we came to the end, there was a cobblestone path 
leading west. in what seem only a few moments, we'd reach a line of 
bluff overlook the hudson. the early spring wind was cutting into 
my face, cause my nostril to feel on fire. 

as we stood gaze down at the ripple waters of the hudson below, 
where a lone sailboat was caught in the breeze, the moment took on a 
timelessness, feeling as though it could have been any place, any 
century. 

"incidentally," he went on, turning slightly to me, "are you familiar 
with the name asklepios?" 

i had to shake my head no. it sound vague familiar, but . . . 

"he was the ancient greece god of medicine. the physician who revere 
him held that sickness could be cure use drug and potion that came 
from outside the body, since they believe that's where disease 
originated. now, of course, billion-dollar industry thrive by 
enhance our arsenal of antibiotics." 

i listen to this, wonder where he was headed. then he told me. 

"there was, however, another school of heal at that time, those who 
honor the daughter of asklepios. she was hygeia, their goddess of 
health. the hygeian believe that well originate from properly 
governing your own body. for them, the greatest service of the 
physician was to learn how we can work with our bodies. their ideal was 
heal from within rather than intervention from without." 

again he was study me, as though try to determine whether i was 
go along with what he was saying. 

"unfortunately," he continued, "the hygeian school more or less die 
out in the west. however, it lives on in other places. for example, 
primitive people have no manufactured, synthetic drugs, so they use 
natural herb to enhance their own immune system and stay healthy." 

he turn to study the river, drop into silence. 

"maybe i'm missing something," i declared finally. his hypnotic voice 
had drawn me in, in spite of myself. "how do this relate to 
infertility?" 

he turn back and caught me with his shining eyes. they seem to be 
give off heat of their own. "just as the body is intended to heal 
itself, so is a woman's womb meant to create life. if she's childless, 
the reason more often than not is that her body is out of harmony with 
itself. what i do here is seek out each woman's unique energy flow and 
attempt to restore them, use eastern practice and hygeian herbal 
therapies." 

"does it always succeed?" i abrupt wonder if his technique might 
work for me. face it, western medicine had completely struck out. the 
problem was, the guy was just a little too smooth. 

"not always. some women's body are naturally unresponsive, just as 
all organism are subject to random . . . irregularities. in those 
cases, i try to provide her a child by other means." 

"you mean adoption," i suggested. 

"by whatever means seem appropriate," he reply cryptic 

"well, there's something i'd like to understand. last week i met a 
woman who had adopt a baby boy through children of light. she got him 
in three months. such a thing is, according to what i can find out, 
total unheard of. so how did you manage that?" 

he stare down at the river. "i thought i'd explain that adoption 
are not what we primarily do here. they're provided only as a last 
resort, in the few case where my regimen of hygeian therapy fails." 

"but in those cases, where do you find--?" 

"as i've said before we talk about adoption, first we need to satisfy 
ourselves that no other option are possible." then his eyes click 
into me. "if you could come back next saturday to begin your test and 
receive an orientation, i could give you an opinion about your chance 
of bearing a child. it will require a thorough examination, but i can 
usually tell with a good degree of certainty whether my program can 
help someone or not. it's really important, though, that you stay at 
least . . ." he was staring at me. "mind if i do something that might 
relieve some of the symptom of that cold?" 

he reach out and touched my temple with his long, lean fingers. then 
he placed his thumb just above my eyebrow and pressed very hard. 
after a long moment, he slow move the pressure down to the bridge of 
my nose, then across under my eyes. finally he put the heel of his 
hand just above my ear and pressed again. after a couple of seconds 
he step away and continue talk as though nothing had happened. 

"after i give you a full examination, we can discuss our next step." 
with that he turned, ready to head back. "now if you'll excuse me, i've 
got a lot of research data to organize." 

i guess he assume his juggernaut of arcane medical theory had roll 
over me sufficient that he could move on to other matters. i sense 
he really want me to come back, but he was careful to wind down our 
mutual interview with a take-it-or-leave-it air. all the same, i felt 
intrigue as we move back through the garden and then into the 
courtyard. a baby. maybe he could make it happen for steve and me. in 
spite of myself, i felt a moment of hope. 

"thank you for coming," he said by way of farewell, just brush my 
hand, then turn and disappear through one of the ancient wooden 
door along the veranda, leave me alone. 

well, i thought, the calm voice and casual outfit are probably just 
part of his bedside manner, but you can't be near alex goddard and not 
feel a definite sense of careful control power. but is his power 
being use for good? 

this was the man whose staff was try to deny me interview with 
mother who'd adopt through children of light. and what about the 
hispanic hood with the gun? did alex goddard send him? if not, his 
appearance at paula's building was one hell of a coincidence. so why 
should i trust . . . 

that was when i notice it. my lingering cold had miraculous 
vanished, inflamed sinus and all. i was breathing normally, and even 
my chest felt cleared. 

my god, i thought, what did he do? hypnotize me? it was as though a 
week's heal had pass through my body. 

i had an epiphany, a moment that galvanize your resolve. i had to do a 
documentary about this man, to find out what he was really up to. he'd 
mention he had a place in central america. was that the source of his 
special techniques, some kind of ancient meso-american medical 
practice he'd discovered? 

he claim he didn't want any publicity, but that's always just an 
opening move. when somebody say that, what they really mean is they 
don't want any bad publicity; they just want to have final say about 
what you produce. there're ways to handle the problem. 

i liberated a brochure from the hall table on my way out, thinking i 
would study it soon. very closely. i had a nose for a good story, and 
this one felt right. 

when i got back to the car, lou was nowhere to be seen. he'd given me 
the impression he intended merely to sit there and doze while i went 
inside, but now he was gone. 

then he appear emerge from the forest of trees. actually, there was 
another building opposite the stone drive that i hadn't notice at 
first. hmmm, i thought, i wonder what that's all about. for some reason 
alex goddard hadn't offer me a tour; he'd taken me for a stroll in 
the opposite direction. . . . 

"that was fast," lou said settle into the car. "you get what you came 
for?" 

the answer to that was both yes and no. in a sense i'd gotten 
considerably more than i bargain for. 

"he wants me to come back," i said. "and i think i might do it. there's 
a lot more go on with alex goddard than you'd know from just look 
at this place. the trick is to stay in control when you're around him." 

i toss the brochure into lou's lap as i start the engine. he took 
it and immediately began look through it. 

lou, i knew, was a man always interested in fact and figures. as we 
head toward the parkway he was pour through the brochure with 
intense interest, even as i try to give him a brief reprise of alex 
goddard's medical philosophy. 

"it say here his patient come from all over the united states and 
europe," he noted, finally interrupt me. 

i found nothing odd in that, and went back to rambling on about quetzal 
manor. give the place its due, it was placid and tranquil and smack 
of the benign spirituality goddard claim to put so much stock in. 
still, i found it unsettling. 

however, lou, as usual, chose to see matter his own way. he'd been 
study the fine print at the back of the brochure, mumble to 
himself, and then he emit a grunt of discovery. 

"ah, here's what i was look for," he declared. "you know, as a 
register new york state adoption agency, this outfit has got to 
divulge the number of baby they placed during their last yearly 
report period." 

"according to him, he only resort to adoption if he can't cure your 
infertile with his special mind-body regimen," i remind him. "your 
energy flows--" 

"no shit," lou observed, then went on. "well, then i guess his 
mind-body, energy flows, whatever, bullshit must fail a lot. because 
last year the number was just under two hundred. so at sixty thou a 
pop, like it say here, we're talk about twelve million smackeroo 
gross in a year. not a bad way to fail, huh?" 

i caught myself emit a soft whistle as he read out the number. 
there was definitely a lot more go on with alex goddard than met the 
eye. 

"so what's he do with all that dough?" lou mused. "better question 
still, where in the hell did he find two hundred fresh, orphan 
babies, all list here as caucasian? and get this: the age report 
at final process are all just a couple of months, give or take." 

good questions, i thought. maybe that's the reason he doesn't want 
publicity; it sound a little too commercial for a mind-body guru. 

my other thought was, with so many baby somehow available, why was 
alex goddard so reluctant to even discuss adoption with me? 

the answer, i was sure, lay in the fact he already knew more about me 
than i knew about him. he knew i was making a film about adoption (how 
did he come by that knowledge? i kept wondering) and he was concerned 
he might be mention in it. i kept ask myself, why? 

on our drive back down the henry hudson parkway, i decided i was 
definitely look at a documentary in the making. i just had to decide 
whether to do it with or without his cooperation. 




chapter six 


after i drop off lou at his space in soho, where he was house 
sitting for an estate now in the courts, i decided to head on home. the 
more i thought about alex goddard, the more i felt frustrate and even 
a little angry that i'd completely fail to find out any of the things 
i'd want to learn about him. i replay our interview in my mind, got 
nowhere, and then decided to push away thought of quetzal manor for a 
while and dwell on something else: sarah, my film, anything. 

it was saturday, and unfortunately i had no plan for the evening. 
translation: no steve. back to where i started. how many million 
story in the naked city, and i was just so many million plus one. 
it's not a jungle out there, it's a desert. 

the truth was, after steve took off, i hadn't really been try all 
that hard to pick myself up off the canvas and look around. besides, i 
didn't want some other guy, i want him. add to that, i somehow felt 
that when you're on the short countdown for forty, you shouldn't have 
to be go out on blind dates, wonder whether that buttoned-down 
mba sitting across from you in some trendy italy restaurant think 
you're a blimp (even though you skip lunch), telling yourself he's 
presentable, doesn't seem like a serial killer, has a job, only 
mention his mother once, and could qualify as an acceptable life's 
mate. there's no spark, but he's probably quite nice. you wan 
remember that old barney's ad jingle, "select, don't settle," but at 
this stage of life you're ready to admit you've flunk out in love 101 
and should just go with like. 

which was one of the reason i miss steve so deeply. he was a lover, 
but he was also a best friend. and i was running low on those. 

every woman needs a best pal. after my former best, betsy, married joel 
aimes, off-broadway's latest contribution to dreamworks, and move to 
the coast with him, i was notice a lot of empty evenings. in the old 
days, we could talk for hours. it was funny, since we were actually 
very different. betsy, who had forgotten more about clothes and makeup 
than most women would ever know, hung around the garment-center 
showroom and always came away with sample of next season's couture, 
usually for a song. i envy her that, since i usually just pretended 
not to care and pull on another pair of jeans every morning. but she 
share my love of asia music. 

anyway, now she was gone and i could tell we weren't working hard 
enough at stay in touch. she and joel had just move to a new 
apartment and i didn't even have her latest phone number. . . . 

which brought me back to steve. i'd often wonder why we were so 
alike, and i'd finally decided it was because we both start from the 
same place spiritually. in his case, that place was a crummy childhood 
in new haven--which he didn't want to talk about much because, i 
gathered, it was as lonely and deprived as my own, or at least as 
depressing. his father had own a small candy store and had want all 
his four children to become "professionals." the oldest had become a 
lawyer, the next a teacher. when steve's turn came, he was told he 
should become a doctor, or at the very least, a dentist. 

didn't happen. he'd manage four years of preme at 

yale, but then he rebelled, cash in his med-school scholarship, and 
went to paris to study photography. the result was he'd done what he 
wanted, been reasonably successful at it, and his father had never 
forgiven him. i think he was still strive for the old man's approval, 
even after all the years, but i doubt he'd ever get it. steve was a 
guy still coming to grip with things that couldn't be changed, but in 
the meantime he live in world that were as different from his own 
past as he could find. he deliberate avoid middle-class comforts, 
and was never happy than when he was in some miserable speck on the 
map where you couldn't drink the water. whatever else it was, it wasn't 
new haven. . . . 

thinking about him at that moment, i had an almost irresistible desire 
to reach for my cell phone and call him. god, i miss him. did he miss 
me the same way? i want so much to hear him say it. 

i had a contact number for him in belize city, an old, brit-like hotel 
call the bellevue, where they still serve high tea, but i always 
seem to call when he was out somewhere in the rain forest, shooting. 

do it. don't be a wuss. 

but then i got cold feet. did i want him to think i was chase after 
him? i didn't want to sound needy . . . though that was exactly what i 
felt like at the moment. 

finally i decided to just invent a phone conversation, recreate one 
from times past, one where we both felt secure enough to be flip. it 
was something i did more than i'd like to admit. usually there'd be 
eight ring at his park slope loft and then a harry voice. yes. 
steve, talk to me. . . . 

"yo. this is not a recording. i am just in a transcendent plane. and if 
that's you, murray, i'll have the contact sheet there by six. patience 
is a virtue." 

"honey, it's me. get out of the darkroom. get a life." 

"oh, hi, baby." finally tune in. "i'm working. in a quest for 
unrelenting pictorial truth. but mainly i'm thinking of you." 

"you're printing, right? darling, it's lunch hour. don't you feel 
guilty, working all the time?" 

the truth was, it was one of the reason i respect him so much. he 
even did his own contacts. his fervor match my drive. it's what made 
us perfect mates. 

"i've got ton of guilt. but i'm try to get past it. become a full 
human person. go back to the dawn of man. paint my face and dance in a 
thunderstorm." he'd pause, as though start to get oriented. "hey, 
look at the time. christ. i've got a print shoot on thirty-eighth 
street at three." 

he was chase a bit of fashion work to supplement his on-again, 
off-again magazine assignments. 

"love," i said in my reverie, "can you come over tonight? i promise to 
make it worth your while. it involve a bubble bath, champagne, rose 
everywhere, sensuous raga on the cd. and maybe some crispy oyster or 
something, sent in later on, just to keep us going." 

then i'd listen to the tone of his voice, knowing he'd say yes but 
putt more stock in how he said it. still, he always gave his lines a 
good read. 

"then why don't we aim for about nine?" i'd go on, blissful. "that 
ought to give me a chance to get organized. and don't bring anything 
except your luscious self." the fantasy was coming together in my mind. 
thinking back, i realize how much i miss him, all over again. . . . 

that was when the phone on the armrest beside me rang for real. for a 
moment i was so startle i almost hit the brakes. then i click it on, 
my mind still buzz about steve, and also, in spite of my resolve, 
about the curious runaround i'd just gotten from alex goddard. 

"listen, there was a message on my machine when i came 

in. i've got to go up to the hospital. right now." lou's voice was 
brim with hope and exuberance. "they said sarah was stirring. she's 
open her eyes and start talking. they said she's not making much 
sense, but . . . oh, god." 

"that's wonderful." i felt my heart expand with life. for some 
reason, i had a flash of memory of her climb up into the rickety 
little tree house--well, more like a platform--i'd help her build in 
my thirteenth summer, no boys invite to assist. a year later that part 
had seem terminal dumb. "i'll meet you there." 

i was almost home, but i screech the car around and head east. 
racing over, though, i try not to wish for too much. i kept 
remember all the stage to a complete recovery and telling myself 
that whatever had happened, it was only the first step on a very long, 
very scary journey. . . . 

i hadn't realize how scary till i walk into the room. lou, who had 
gotten there just minutes before i did, was sitting by her side, 
holding her hand, his gaze transfix on her. she was prop up 
slightly in her bed, two pillow fluff behind her head, staring 
dreamy at the ceiling. three attentive middle-aged nurse were 
standing around the side of her bed, their eyes wide, as though sarah 
were a ghost. i very quick realize why. she was spin out a 
fantasy that could only come from a derange mind. had she regain 
consciousness only to talk madness? 

"lou, do she recognize you?" i asked. 

he just shook his head sadly, never taking his eyes off her face. she 
was weave in and out of reality, pausing, stuttering, uncertain of 
her incoherent brain. once, when she'd fallen off a swing and got 
knock out for a brief moment, she came to talk nonsense. now she 
seem exactly the same way. 

"lights ... so bright," she mumbled, start up again to recount what 
seem to be a faraway fantasy, ". . . like now. 

why . . . why are there lights here?" her lip were moving but her eyes 
were still fixed in a stare. then, with that last, odd question, her 
gaze began to dart about the room, look for someone who wasn't 
present. she settled on me for a moment, and i felt a chill from her 
plaintive vulnerability. when i try to look back as benign and 
loving as possible, i couldn't help notice how drawn her cheek 
were, doubtless from the constant iv feeding, and again my heart went 
out. "i'm scared," she went on, "but--" 

"i'm here, honey," lou declared, bend over her, his eyes pained. "do 
you know who i am?" 

"the jade face . . . a mask," she babble on, still ignore him. "all 
the colors. it's so . . . so beautiful." 

her hallucination didn't relate to anything i could understand. she 
clearly was off in another world, like when she was a kid, weave the 
lights of the room now into some kind of dream. i touched lou's 
shoulder and ask permission to turn off the overhead fluorescents, 
but he just shrug me off, his attention focus entire on her. 

his eyes had grown puzzled, as though he want to believe she was 
return to rational but his common sense was telling him it wasn't 
true. 

i was have a different reaction. what she was saying was random 
babblings, all right, but i was beginning to think she was relive 
something she had actually seen. 

however, she wasn't through. 

"i want to pray, but . . . the white tunnel . . . is coming." she 
shuddered, then almost try to smile. "take me . . ." 

she was gone, her eyelid flutter uncontrollably. 

"honey, talk to me," lou pleaded. he was crying, something i'd never 
seen him do, something i was not even aware he was capable of. what he 
really was try to say was, "come back." 

it wasn't happening. she stare blank at the ceiling for a moment, 
then slow closed her eyes, a shutter descend over her soul. 

"she'll be okay," i whisper to him, almost believe it. her brain 
had undergone a physical trauma, enough to cause a coma, but some kind 
of mental trauma must have precede it. was she now try to exorcise 
that as part of her path to recovery? 

the nurse in the room stirred, perhaps not sure what to do. the 
overhead lights were still dazzling bright, and i move to shut them 
off, leave only a night-light behind the bed. perhaps the lights had 
brought her awake, but i was convinced what she'd just gone through had 
tired her to the point that she would not revive again that day. 

then one of the caribbean nurse came over and placed her hand on lou's 
shoulder. she had an experienced face, full of self-confidence. 
something about her inspired trust. 

"i wouldn't let this upset you too much," she said, a lovely lilt in 
her voice. "what just happen may or may not mean anything. when 
patient first come out of a coma, they can sometimes talk just fine, 
and yet not make any sense. they ramble on about things they dream of 
like they were real." then she smiled. "but it's a good first step. she 
could wake up perfectly fine tomorrow. just don't pay any attention to 
what she say for a while. she's dream now." 

lou grunt as though he believe her. i nod in sympathy, though no 
one seem to notice. 

i also thought that although what sarah had said was bizarre, it 
sound like something more than a dream. or had she gone back to her 
child-state where imaginary world were real for her? 

then in the dim glare of her bed light, lou took a wrinkle blue 
booklet out of his inner pocket and stare at it. i had to stare at it 
a moment before i realize it was a passport. 

"what--?" 

"the america consulate in merida, mexico, sent it up to 26 federal 
plaza yesterday, because my name and office address are pencil on the 
inside cover as an emergency contact. the police down there said 
somebody, some gringo tourist fly-fishing way down on the usumacinta 
river, near where the rio tigre come in from guatemala, snag this 
floating in a plastic bag. he turn it in to the mexico authority 
there, and it end up with our people." he open the passport and 
stare at it. "the photo and id page is rip out, but it's definitely 
sarah's." he hand it over. "guy i know downtown drop it off last 
night. i'm not sure if it has anything to tell us, but now, i was 
hope it might help jog her memory." 

i took it, the cover so waterlogged its color was almost gone. however, 
it must have been kept dry in the plastic bag for at least some of its 
trip from wherever, since much of the damage seem recent. 

lou shook his head staring wistful at me. "i still don't know how she 
got down there. she was in california. remember that postcard? if she'd 
come back east, she'd have got in touch. wouldn't she?" his eyes 
plead for my agreement. 

i didn't know what to say, so i just shrugged. i want to be 
sympathetic, but i refuse to lie outright. he took my ambivalence as 
assent as he pull out the locket contain her picture, his 
talisman. he finger it for a moment, staring into space, and then he 
look down and open it, as if seeing her high school picture, from a 
time when she was well, would somehow ease his mind. 

"this whole thing doesn't sound like her," he went on. "know what i 
think? she was being held down there against her will." 

my heart went out to him, and i reach over and took the locket for a 
moment, feeling the strong "src" engrave on its heart-shaped face. 
"lou, she's go to come out of it. and when she does, she'll probably 
explain everything. she's go to be okay any day now, i've got a 
hunch. a gut feeling." 

i had a gut feeling, all right, but not that she was go to be fine. 
my real fear was she was go to wake up a fantasy-bound child again. 

then i hand the locket back. he'd seem to turn anxious without it. 
he took the silver heart and just stare down at it. in the silence 
that settled over us, i decided to take a close look at the passport. 
i supposed lou had already gone through it, but maybe he'd miss 
something. 

as i flip through the waterlogged pages, i came across a smudgy 
imprint, cake with a thin layer of dry river clay, that was almost 
too dim to be noticed. 

"lou, did you see this?" i held it under the light and beckon him 
over. "can you read it?" 

"probably not without my specs." he took it and squint helplessly. 
"my eyes aren't get any better." 

i took it back and rub at the page, clean it. it was hard to make 
out, but it look like "delegacion de migracion, aeropuerto 
internacional, guatemala, c.a." 

"i think this is a guatemala tourist entry visa." i raise the 
passport up to backlight the page. "and see that faint bit there in the 
center? that's probably her entry date. written in by hand." 

he took it and squint again. "i can't read the damn thing, but 
you're right. there's some numbers, or something, scribble in." 

i took it and rub the page till i could read it clearly. "it's march 
eleventh. and it was last year." 

"hot damn, let me see that." he seize it back and squint for a long 
moment, lift the page even close to the light. "you're right." he 
held it for a second more, then turn to me. "this is finally the 
thing i needed. now i'm damn well go to find out what she was 
do down there." 

"how do you think you can do that?" i just look at him, my mind not 
quite taking in what he'd just said. 

"the airlines." he almost grinned. "if they can keep track of 
everybody's damn frequent-flyer mile for years and years, they 
undoubted got flight manifest store away somewhere too. so my first 
step is to find out where she flew from." 

"but we don't know which--" 

"doesn't matter." he squint again at the passport. "now we know for 
sure she show up at the airport in guatemala city on that date there. 
i know somebody downtown, smooth black guy name john williams, the 
fbi's best computer nerd, who could bend a rule for me and do a little 
b&e in cyberspace. he owe me a couple. so, if she was on a manifest 
for a schedule flight into guatemala city that day, he'll find it. 
then we'll know where she left from, who else was on the plane." he 
tap the passport confident with his forefinger. "maybe she was 
travel with some scumbag i ought to look up and get to know better." 

"well, good luck." 

in a way i was wonder if we weren't both now grasping for a miracle: 
me half-hoping for a baby through some new age process of "centering," 
lou try to reclaim sarah from her mental abyss with his gruff love. 
but then again, miracle have been known to happen. 




chapter seven 


"quetzal manor could have the makings of a great documentary," i was 
explain to david roth. "i just need some more information-gathering 
first, to get a better feeling for what alex goddard is up to. so go 
back up there will be two bird with one stone. i'll learn more about 
him, and he might even be able to tell me why i haven't been able to 
get pregnant." 

he was frowning, his usual skeptical self. "how long--?" 

"it's just for the weekend, or maybe a little . . . i'm not sure 
exactly. i guess it depend on what kind of test he's go to run. 
but the thing is, i have to do it now, while he and i are still 
clicking. an 'iron is hot' kind of moment. the only possible problem 
might be if i have to push back my schedule for loop dialogue for 
_baby love _and then somebody's out of town." 

"you check with the sound studio to warn them about possible 
rescheduling?" he want to appear to be fuming. but since he'd invite 
me down to his tribeca loft at least once every three months, now that 
i'd finally shown up, he also had a small gleam in his eye. what did 
that mean? 

"yes, but i've already spotted most of the work print, and i've made 
tentative dates for people to come in. in a week and a half. 
everything's still on schedule." 

he lean back on his white couch, as though try to regroup. it was 
saturday morning and i'd already made the 

appointment to see alex goddard. i was going. i probably should have 
run it by david first, but damnit, it was my life. 

truthfully, though, i'd been dread telling him all week, so to try 
and make him as congenial as possible, i'd arrange to see him at home 
and relaxed. it seem to be working, more or less. 

"okay, okay, sometimes i guess it's best to just go with your gut," he 
said, beginning to calm down. he'd offer to whip up some brunch when 
i first arrived, and now i was feeling sorry i'd turn him down. i 
really did like him. but, alas, only as a friend. "before i cave in 
totally, though, do me a favor and tell me some more about this . . . 
documentary? what, exactly, make you think it's--" 

"everything." whereupon i laid on him the full story of car and 
paula, the children, and my encounter with alex goddard. the only thing 
i left out was the story of the hispanic hood since i didn't think he 
could handle it. 

"this quetzal manor sound like a funny operation," he declared 
solemn when i'd finished. "i say the less you have to do with a place 
like that, the better. who know what's go on." 

"but, david that's what make it so interesting. the fact that it _is_ 
a 'funny' operation. i really can see a documentary here, after baby 
love is in the can. but i'll never have a chance if i don't get to know 
this guy while i've got a good excuse. that's how my business works." 

"so you're go to go back up there and . . . is this like go 
undercover or something?" 

"well . . ." what was i go to say? i was actually half beginning to 
believe that alex goddard might be able to figure out why steve and i 
couldn't conceive. it was certainly worth a few days of my life, 
documentary or no documentary. "look, i really want to find out what's 
go on. for a lot of reasons." 

he sigh and sip at his coffee. 

"morgy, this has got to be quick. nicky russo call again. the thing 
i've learned about loan sharks, they keep your books better than you 
do. he know exactly how much money we've got left and how long we can 
last. he's licking his chops, get ready to eat us whole." 

"what did you tell him?" the very thought of nicky gave me a chill. if 
we miss so much as a week on the juice, he'd have the legal right to 
just seize my negative. when you're desperate, you sign those kind of 
loans. 

"i told him something i haven't even told you yet." he smile a wicked 
grin. "i know you've been schmooze lifetime about a cable deal, but 
before we put the ink to that, i want to finish some new talks i've 
start with orion, their distribution people." 

i think i stop breathing for a second or two. was there a chance for 
a theatrical release for _baby love_, not just a cable deal? 

"when . . . you've actually met with them? how--?" 

"late yesterday." he was still grinning. "i ran into jerry rein at 
morton's and pitch the picture. actually, i heard he was in town, so 
i wore a tie and ambush him at lunch. he wants to see a rough cut as 
soon as we've got something ready." 

"david, you're an angel." i was ecstatic. it was more than i'd dare 
hope for. 

"so stay focused, for chrissake, and finish your picture. we're this 
close to saving our collective asses, so don't blow it. i've gone over 
all the schedule pretty carefully, and i'd guess we can spare a day or 
two, but if you drag this out, i'm go to read you your contract, the 
fine print about due diligence, and then finish up the final cut 
myself. i mean it. don't make me do that." 

"don't you even think about that." never! "this is my picture." 

"just business. if it's a choice between do what i gotta do, or 
have nicky russo chew me a new asshole and become the silent partner 
in applecore, guess what it's gonna be." 

"david, you know i would never let that happen." i walk over and gave 
him the sweetest hug i knew how, still fill with joy. "and thanks so 
much for try to get us a theatrical. you don't know how much that 
means to me." 

"hey, don't try the charm bit on me. i'm serious. i'll cut you a 
weekend's slack, but then it's back to the salt mines. either this 
picture's in the can inside of six weeks, or we're both go to be 
look for new employment. so go the hell up there, do whatever it is 
you're go to do, and then get this damn picture finished. there'll 
be plenty of time after that to worry about our next project. with luck 
we might even have the money for it." 

with that ultimatum still ring in my ears, i took my leave of david 
roth and head north, up the henry hudson parkway. my life was get 
too roller-coaster for words. . . . 

as i drove, i try not to dwell on the practical aspect of what was 
coming. it was hard to imagine what test alex goddard could perform 
that hadn't already been done by hannah klein. just thinking back over 
that dismal sequence made me feel baby-despondent all over again. 

when i first mention i was thinking about try to get pregnant, she 
look me over, perhaps mental calculating my age and my prospects, 
and then made a light suggestion. 

"why don't i give you a prescription for clomid. clomiphene citrate 
enhance ovulation, and it might be a good idea in your case. you're 
still young, morgan, but you're no long in the first blush of youth." 

i took it for six months, but nothing happened. that was the beginning 
of my pregnancy depression. 

by that time, she'd decided i definitely had a problem, so she began 
what she call an "infertility workup." the main thing was to check my 
fallopian tube for blockage and look for ovulatory abnormalities. but 
everything turn out to be fine. depression city. 

"well," she said, "maybe your body just _thinks_ you've release an 
ovum. we need to do an ultrasound scan to make doubly sure an ovarian 
follicle has rupture when it's schedule to and drop an egg." 

it turn out, however, that all those hormone stop-and-go signal 
were working just fine. in the meantime, steve and i were do it like 
bunny and still no pregnancy. 

okay, she then declared, the problem may be with your fallopian tube 
after all. time to test for abnormalities. "this is not go to be 
fun. first we have to dilate your cervix, after which we inject a dye 
and follow it with x-rays as it move through the uterus and is eject 
out of your fallopian tubes. we'll know right away if there's any kind 
of blockage. if there is something, we can go in and fix it." 

"sort of check out my pipes," i said, try to come to grip with the 
procedure. i was increasingly sink into despondency. 

she did it all, and for a while she suspect there might be some kind 
of anatomical problem. which brought us to the next escalate of 
invasiveness. 

"we've got to go in and take a close-up look at everything," she said. 
"it's a procedure call laparoscopy. i'll have to make a small 
incision near your navel and insert a tiny optical device. in your 
case, i want to combine it with what's call a hysteroscopy, which 
will allow me to see directly inside your uterus for polyp and 
fibroids." 

but again everything look fine. i began to wonder what had happen 
to everybody's mother's warning you could get pregnant just letting 
some pimple guy put his hand in your pants. 

prior to all this, i should add, steve had provided sample of sperm to 
be test for number and vigor. (both were just fine.) then, toward the 
end of all the indignities, he actually paid to have some kind of test 
perform involve a hamster egg, to see if his sperm was lively 
enough to penetrate it. no wonder he finally went over the edge. 

now i was reduce to alex goddard. i'd brought a complete set of my 
medical test records, as ramala had request on the phone. i'd also 
brought a deep curiosity about what exactly he could do that hadn't 
already been done. i further wonder how i was go to talk steve 
into coming back long enough to share in the project. as i motor up 
the driveway to quetzal manor, i told myself he love me still, want 
a baby as much as i did . . . well, let me be safe and say almost as 
much. the problem was, he was so demoralize about the whole thing. and 
then what? what if nothing happened? 

i start to park my car where i had the last time, then notice the 
place actually had a parking lot. it was located off to the left side 
of the driveway, near the second, modern building, and was more or less 
hidden in amongst the trees. the lot was fill with a lot of 
late-model but inexpensive cars, basic working-girl transportation, and 
it seem a better bet for long-term parking. 

the front lobby, which had been empty the first time i was there, was 
now a minimalist reception area, a long metal desk roll in from 
somewhere. i had the odd feeling it was there just for me. the woman 
behind the desk introduce herself as ramala, the same person i'd 
talk to twice on the phone. she look to be about my age, with long 
dark hair and quick asia eyes, punctuate by a professional smile. 

she knew my name, use it the minute she saw me, and then abrupt 
hand me a twenty-page "application" to complete. 

"it's not just a formality," she explained, businesslike and earnest. 
"dr. goddard feel it's essential that he come to know you as a person. 
he'll read this carefully, believe me." 

she usher me to a chair that had a retractable table for writing, 
then gave me a ballpoint pen. 

the document turn out to be the most prying, nosy thing i'd ever 
fill out. the page demand what amount to a mini life history. 
one of the things that struck me as most strange was the part ask 
for a ten-year employment and residential history. if you've move 
around as much as i have, work freelance a lot, you'll understand how 
difficult it can be to reconstruct all those dates and places, but i 
did my best. 

there were, of course, plenty of health question too. one page even 
ask whether there was anything out of the ordinary about my own 
birth: was the delivery difficult, a cesarean, a breach baby? it was, 
as noted, a life history. 

"why do he need all this information?" i ask finally, feeling the 
onset of carpal tunnel syndrome in my right wrist. "i brought all my 
medical records." 

ramala gave me a kindly smile, full of sympathy. 

"he must know you as a person. then everything is possible. when i came 
here, i had given up on ever have a child, but i surrender myself 
to him and now my husband and i have twin boys, three years old. that's 
why i stay to help him. his program can work miracles, but you must 
give him your trust." 

well, i thought, i might as well go with the flow and see where it 
leads. 

when i'd finished the form, she took it back, along with the pen, then 
usher me into the wide central courtyard where i'd met alex goddard 
the first time. he was nowhere to be seen, but in the bright 
late-morning sunshine there was a line of about twenty women, from late 
twenty to early forties, all dress in white pajama-like outfit of 
the kind you see in judo classes, do coordinated, slow-motion tai 
chi-like exercises. they were intent, their eyes fixed on the fringe 
of infinity. 

these must be some of his acolytes, i thought, the one i heard in 
their nuns' cell the first time i was here. what on earth do all 
this oriental have to do with fertility? i then found myself 
wondering. i've studied the far east enough to do "penetrating" 
documentary about it, and i still can't get pregnant. 

i took one look at them--none of them look at me--and my heart went 
out. they were so sincere, so sure of what they were doing. for 
somebody who's always questioning everything, like me, it was touching, 
and maybe a little daunt too. 

without a word, ramala led me past them and on to an entryway at the 
far end of the courtyard, past the giant dance shiva. the door was 
huge and ornate, decorate with beaten-copper filigree--much like one 
i'd seen in a mogul palace in northern india. definitely awe-inspiring. 

she pushed open the door without ceremony and there he was, dress in 
white and look for all the world like the miracle worker he claim 
to be. he seem to be meditate in his chair, but the moment i 
entered, his deep eyes snap open. 

"did you bring your records?" he asked, not get up. while i was 
produce them from my briefcase, ramala discreet disappeared. 

"please have a seat." he gesture me toward a wide chair. 

the room was a sterile baby blue, nothing to see. no diplomas, no 
photos, nothing. 

except for another, small bronze statue of the dance shiva, poised 
on a silver-inlaid table. i also notice that his own flowing hair 
seem to match that of the bronze figure. 

yes, i thought, i was right. that's who he think he is. and he has 
complete power over the people around him. how many chance do you get 
to do a documentary about somebody like this? i should have brought a 
betacam for some video. 

he studied my test record as a jeweler might examine a diamond, his 
serious eyes bore in as he flip through the pages. the rest of his 
face, however, betray no particular interest. i finally felt 
compel to break the awkward silence. 

"as you can see, i've had every test known to science. and none of them 
found anything wrong." 

he just nodded, saying nothing, and kept on reading. 

after a long, awkward silence, i decided to try and open things up a 
bit. 

"tell me, do you have any children of your own?" 

the question seem to be one he didn't get ask too often, because he 
stop cold. 

"all those who come here are my children," he replied, putt aside my 
records, dismiss finished with them. 

"well"--i pointed to them--"what do you think?" 

"i haven't examine you yet," he said, look up and smiling, indeed 
beam with confidence. "nothing in those record tell me anything 
about what may be your problem. i look for different things than do 
most physicians." 

he fiddle with something beneath his desk, and the room was abrupt 
fill with the sound of a hypnotic drone. perhaps its frequency 
match one in my brain, because i instantly felt relax and full of 
hope. much better than muzak. then he rose and came over. 

is he go to do my exam right here? i wondered. where's all the 
ob/gyn paraphernalia? the humiliate stirrups? 

standing in front of me, he gently placed his hand on my heart, then 
bent over and seem to be listen to my chest. his touch was warm, 
then cold, then warm, but the overall effect was to send a sense of 
well-being through my entire body. 

"you're not breathing normally," he said after a moment of unnerve 
silence. "i feel no harmony." 

how did he know that? but he was right. i felt the way i had the first 
time i try to sit in zen meditation in kyoto. as then, my body was 
relaxing but my wayward brain was still coursing. 

"i'll try," i said, attempt to go along. what i really was feeling 
was the overwhelming sense of his presence, drawing me to him. 

next he move around behind me and cradle my head in his hands, 
place his long fingertip on my forehead, sort of the same way he'd 
done when i was standing with him on the windy heath, nursing a killer 
cold. all the while, the drone seem to be increase to a piercing, 
overwhelming volume, as though a powerful electrical force were grow 
in the room, send me into an alpha state of relaxation. 

"what are you doing? is this how you do an exam for--?" 

"the medical test you had show there's nothing wrong with your 
uterus or your fallopian tubes, nothing that should inhibit conception. 
there's no need to pursue that any further. but the mind and the body 
are a single entity that must be harmonized, must work as one. although 
each individual has different energy flows, i think my regimen here 
could be very helpful to you. already i can tell your problem is a 

self-inflicted trauma that has negate the natural condition wherein 
your mind and body work in unison." 

"what 'trauma'?" i asked. 

he didn't answer the question. instead he began massage my temples. 

"breathe deeply. and do it slowly, very slowly." 

as i did, i felt a kind of dizzy gradual coming over me, the 
hypnotic drone seeming to take over my consciousness. instead of 
grow slower, my breathing was actually becoming more rapid, as 
though i'd start to hyperventilate. but i no long had any control 
over it. my autonomy nervous system had been hand over to him, as 
dizzy and a sense of disorientate settled over me. the room 
around me began to swirl, and i felt my conscious mind, my will, 
slip out of my grasp. it was the very thing i'd vow not to let 
happen. 

the same thing had occur once before, after i broke my collarbone in 
the pacific surf that slam a mexico beach south of puerto villarta. 
when a kindly mexico doctor was later binding on a harness to 
immobilize my shoulder, the pain was such that i momentarily pass out 
while sitting on a stool in his office. i didn't fall over or collapse; 
it just seem as though my mind, flee the incredible pain, drift 
away in a haze of sensation. 

now the pastel blue wall of the room slow fade to white, and then i 
was somewhere else, a universe away, surround by blank nothingness. i 
try to focus on the bronze shiva directly across, but the ring of 
fire around him had become actual flames. the only reality left was the 
powerful touch of alex goddard's hand and a drone that could have been 
the music of the spheres. 




chapter eight 


sometime thereafter, in a reverie, i felt myself in a magical forest 
whose lush vine remind me of kerala in india. it was a verdant, hazy 
paradise, another eden. a child was with me, a child of my own, and i 
felt jubilation. i watch the child as she grew and became a 
resplendent orchid. 

but with childbearing came pain, and i seem to be feeling that pain 
as i took up the flower and held it, joy flowing through me. 

then alex goddard drift into my dream, still all in white, and he was 
gentle and care as he again move his hand over me, leave numb 
in their wake. i thought i heard his voice talk of the miracle that 
he would make for me. a miracle baby, a beautiful flower of a child. i 
ask him how such a thing would happen. a miracle, he whisper back. 
it will be a miracle, just for you. when he said it, the orchid turn 
into the silver face of a cat, a vague familiar image, smile 
benignly, then transmute back into a blossom. 

then he drift out of my dream much as he had come, a wisp of white, 
leave me holding the gorgeous flower against my breasts, which had 
begun to swell and spill out milk the color of gold. . . . 

a wet cool wash across my face, and--as i faint heard the 
sound of bach's well-tempered clavier, glenn gould's piano note crisp 
and clear--i open my eyes to 

see ramala massage my brow with a damp cloth. she smile kindly and 
loving as she saw my eyes open, then widen with astonishment. 

"what--?" 

"hey, how're you doing? don't be alarmed. he's taking great care of 
you." 

"what. . . where am i?" i lift my head off the pillow and try to 
look around. i half expect steve to be there, but of course he wasn't. 

"you're here. at quetzal manor." she reach and did something and the 
music slow fade away. "don't worry. you'll be fine. i think the 
doctor was try to release your chi, and when he did it was too 
strong for you." 

"what day is it?" i felt completely disoriente my bearings gone. 

"sunday. it's sunday morning." she reach and touched my brow as 
though give me a blessing. like, it's okay, really. 

at that moment, alex goddard stroll in, dress again in white. 

just as in the dream, i thought. 

"so, how's the patient?" he walk over--eyes benign and caring--and 
lift my wrist, absently taking my pulse while he insert a digital 
thermometer in my ear. for a flashback moment he merge into, then 
emerge from, my dream. "you're look fine. i have to say, though, 
you had quite a time yesterday." 

"all i remember is passing out in your office," i mumble glancing 
around at the gray plastic thermometer. and that strange dream, you 
telling me i would have a miracle baby. 

"you had an unusual reaction," he went on. "you remember i spoke to you 
about mind-body harmony. you see what can happen when i redirect the 
flow of energy, chi, from your body to your mind." he smile and 
settled my wrist back onto the bed. "don't worry. i have a lot of hope 
for you. you're go to do fine." 

he look satisfy as he consult the thermometer, then jot down 
my temperature on a chart. he's already start a medical record, i 
thought. why? 

"i'm . . . i'm wonder if this really is working out," i said. it was 
dawn on me that i was get into alex goddard's world a lot deep 
and a lot fast than i'd expected. i'd come plan to be an observer 
and now i was the one being observed. that was exactly not how i'd 
intended it. maybe, i thought, if i back off and make a new run, i can 
keep us on equal footing. "perhaps i ought to just go back to the city 
for a few days and--" 

"i'd assume you came to begin the program." he look at me, a quick 
sad flood his eyes. "you struck me as a person who would follow 
through." 

"i need to think this over" i really feel terrible, i thought, try 
to rise up. what did he do to me? "maybe i'm just not right for your 
'program'?" the idea of a documentary had momentarily retreat far 
into the depths of my mind. 

"on the contrary." he smiled. "we've shown that you're very responsive." 

"maybe that's it. maybe i'm too responsive." i rose and slip my feet 
off the bed. the motion brought a piercing pain in my abdomen. "ouch! 
what's . . ." i felt my pelvis, only to find it was very sensitive. 

pull aside my bed shift, i gaze in disbelief at my lower abdomen. 
there were red spot just above my pale blue panties. 

alex goddard modest avert his eyes. "i didn't want to say 
anything," he explain to the wall above my head, "but you were in 
pretty delicate shape there for a while. mild convulsions, and i think 
your digestive system had gone into shock. the stomach is a center of 
energy, because it's constant active. so i gave you some shot of 
muscle relaxant. nothing serious. it's an unusual treatment, but i've 
found it works. it . . . modulate the energy flows. i also took a 
blood sample for some tests, but the result were all normal." 

he then ask me about my menstrual cycle, exact days, saying he want 
to make sure it wasn't just routine cramps. "the seizure you had pass 
almost as soon as it came, but you might actually have been 
hallucinate a bit. you had a slight fever all night." 

"well . . ." something like that had happen to me years ago in rural 
japan, when i stupid ate some unwashed greens and my stomach went 
into shock. at one point a local doctor, chinese, was try 
acupuncture, which also left me sore. 

"nothing to be worried about," he continued. "but if you're the least 
bit concerned, maybe we ought to do a quick sonogram, take a sound 
picture. ease your mind that everything's okay." 

"that doesn't really seem necessary," i said. for a clinic specialize 
in "energy flows" and "mind-body" programs, there was a lot of modern 
equipment. odd. 

"won't do a bit of harm." he nod at ramala, who also seem to think 
it was a good idea. "come on, help me walk her down to the lab." he 
turn back. "it's total noninvasive. you'll see for yourself that 
you're fine." 

before i could protest, i found myself walking, with some dizziness, 
down the hallway. this part of quetzal manor, which i had not seen 
before, was a sterile, high-tech clinic. i realize i was in a 
different building from the old convent, probably the new one i'd 
notice across the parking lot, the one he hadn't bother to mention 
that first day. but all i could focus on were the blue wall and the 
new white tile of the floor. 

the sonogram was as he describe it, quick and noninvasive. he rub 
the ultrasound wand over my abdomen, watch the picture on a crt 
screen, which show my insides, a jumble of organ that he seem to 
find extremely informative. 

"look." he pointed. "those lines there are your fallopian tubes, and 
that's your uterus." he pushed a button to record a digital image. 
"seems like whatever was upset your stomach is gone. obviously 
nothing's wrong here." 

"good," i said, "because i really need to take a few days and think 
this over." 

"you should stay," he said, reach to touch my hand. "i think the 
worst is well behind us. from here on, we can work together. in fact, 
what i actually wish you would do is come with me to my clinic in 
central america. it's truly a place of miracles." 

i assume he was refer to the "special place" he'd mention during 
our first interview. if quetzal manor was on the exotic side, i 
thought, what must that place be like? a documentary that took in the 
totality of who and what he was could be-- 

"in fact," he went on, "i just learned i have to be go there later 
today. a quick trip to catch up on some things. so this would be an 
ideal time for you to come. we could go together." 

well, i thought, i'd love to see what else he's up to, but this whole 
scene is get out of control. when i first met alex goddard, we had 
a power balance, but now he's definitely calling the shots. 

"i don't think i'm ready for that kind of commitment yet." 

"as you wish." he smile with understanding. "but let me just say this. 
it's not go to be easy, but nothing i've seen so far suggest 
there's any physical reason why you can't have a child. we just need to 
get you in touch with the energy center in your body. right flow 
from that." 

"you really think so?" in spite of myself i felt my hope rising, even 
though i had definite mixed feelings about his kind of "holistic" 
medicine. 

"i'm virtually certain. but whether you want to continue with the 
program or not is a decision you'll have to make for yourself." 

"well, maybe when i'm feeling better we can talk some more about it." i 
definitely need to reconsider my game plan. "for now, i think i'd 
better just get my things and--" 

"as you wish." he sighed. "your clothes are in your room. there's a 
closet in the corner by the window." 

i shot a glance at him. "does my blue cross cover this?" 

"on the house." a dismiss wave of his hand, and another kindly smile. 

i was still feeling shaky as i move back down the vacant hallway, but 
i refuse to let either of them help me. instead i left him to oversee 
ramala as she shut down the equipment. 

oddly, the place still seem vacant except for me, though there was a 
large white door that appear to lead to another wing. what was in 
there? i wondered. the question kept pile up. 

it soon turn out i was wrong about the clinic being empty. when i 
reach the door to the room where i'd been, i thought i heard a 
shuffle sound inside. i pushed it open gingerly and saw the room was 
dark. it hadn't been when i left. the shuffle noise--i realize it 
was somebody close the venetian blinds--immediately stopped. 

i began feeling along the wall for the light switch. 

"please leave it off," said a spacey female voice. "it's nice when it's 
dark." 

as my eyes became accustomed to the eerie half-light, i finally made 
out a figure. it was a short woman, childlike but probably mid-twenties. 

"what are you do in here?" 

"i just want to, like, be with you." she'd done her dark hair in 
multiple braids, with a red glass bead at the end of each. "you're 
special. we all know it. that's why he brought you over here, to this 
building. to be near them." 

"what do you mean, 'special'?" i asked, heading for the closet and my 
black jeans. then i wondered. near who? 

now she was reach into a fanny pack she had around her waist and 
taking out a baggie fill with plastic vials. "these are herb i've 
start grow here. i picked them for you. if you'll--" 

"slow down," i said, lift my jeans off the hanger and start to 
struggle into them. finally i took the baggie, move to the window, and 
tilt up the blind. inside it were clear plastic medicine bottle 
contain various gray and green powder and flakes. 

my god, what's she try to give me? and why? 

"listen," she went on, insistent. "take those. put two teaspoon of 
each in water you've boil and drink it. every day for a week. they'll 
make you strong. then you'll be--" 

"hey, i'm go to be just fine, really." i set them aside and studied 
her, still a ghostlike figure in the semi dark. there was a wild in 
her eyes that was very disturbing. 

at that moment, alex goddard appear in the doorway. he click on the 
light, look puzzled. 

"couldn't find the switch?" then he glance around. "tara, did you get 
lost? i thought you were do your meditation. it's sunday. 
afterwards, though, you can weed the north herb box if you want." 

she nod silently, then grab the baggie and glide out, her brown 
eyes fill with both reverence and what seem like fear. 

"who was that?" i asked, staring after her, feeling unsettled by the 
whole experience. "she seem pretty intense." 

"tara's been pretty intense for some time, perhaps for much of her 
life," he declared with a note of sad as he closed the door behind 
her. "i've not been able to do anything for her, but i've let her stay 
on here since she has nowhere else to go. she love the gardens, so 
i've let her work out there. it seem to improve her self-esteem, a 
kind of benign therapy, her own natural path toward centering." 

well, i thought, she certainly could use some "centering." 

"look, dr. goddard, let me get my things, and then i've got to be 
going. i can't start on anything right now. not the way i'm feeling. 
and visiting your other clinic is completely out of the question, at 
least for the moment." 

"i have great hope for you," he said again, place a gentle hand on 
my shoulder. "i'm sorry we can't begin to work together immediately. 
but do promise me you'll reconsider and come back soon." 

"maybe when i'm feeling better." keep the option open, i told myself. 
for a lot of reasons. 

"in that case, ramala can show you out. i've arrange for her to give 
you some herbal extract from the rain forest that could well start you 
on the road to motherhood. whether you decide to come back or not, i 
know they'll help you." 

and he was gone, a wisp of white moving out the doorway. it was only 
then that i realize i'd again been too preoccupied to ask him about 
kevin and rachel, the beautiful sibling born six month apart. instead 
all i had left was a memory of those penetrating eyes. and the power, 
the absolute power. 




chapter nine 


after give me a small bag with two bottles, ramala led me out, and i 
discover i really _had _been in a different building, the one 
situated across the long-term parking lot and all but hidden in the 
trees. it was new, one-story, and probably large than it appear from 
the front. again i wonder what went on in there, since it seem so 
empty. 

check it out and soon, i told myself as i slip my key into the 
ignition. you've got to find out a lot more about this place. 

on the drive back to the city, my main thought was that i'd lost a day 
of my life. it'd just sort of slip away. but that wasn't all. i also 
began to meditate on the fact that alex goddard could have an immense 
influence over my body (or was it my mind?) with a simple touch. give 
him his due, he could definitely make things happen. first my cold and 
now this. perhaps he could give me a child, if i got "centered," 
whatever that meant. but why should i trust him? 

and there was another problem. for a baby i'd need steve, the man i 
loved, the guy who'd promise to be with me through thick and thin. did 
he really mean it? he'd have to fly in, which meant a serious piece of 
change for the airfare. finally, could he face another chance of 
failure? my spirits sank at the prospect of have to ask him. were we 
both just go to be humiliate one more time? 

he'd made his home base in belize, that little rhode island of a 
country abut big, bad guatemala. he like the fact they use 
english, more or less, as the official language and they hadn't gotten 
around to murder two hundred thousand maya, the way guatemala had. 
in a romantic moment, i'd program his belize hotel number into the 
memory of my cell phone--the telephone down there are amazing good, 
maybe the brit legacy--though i'd never actually try it. (i'd call 
him from home about half a dozen times, but he was rarely there.) well, 
i thought, the time has come. maybe it was the sensual feelings 
release by all the chi flowing around, but for some reason i found 
myself feeling very lonely. he hadn't call recently, though. . . . 

it took ten rings, but eventually the hotel answered. a moment later, 
they were try his room. i guess i was half afraid a woman might pick 
up, but it was him and there were no hush tone or cryptic 
monosyllables. i heave a minor sigh of reassurance. 

"baby, i can't believe it's you," he declared. "i've actually been 
try to reach you for a day now." 

"you finally get around to missing me?" it was so good to hear his 
voice, full of life and energy. 

"all the time. never didn't. you've just got to understand it's crazy 
down here. all last week i was in honduras, haggle over permits. 
don't ask." he paused. "so, when are you coming down? they've got a 
national park here that's a pure chunk of rain forest, jaguar 
everywhere." he laughed. "but forget that. if you come down, we'll 
never get out of the hotel. just room service all day." 

"no immediate plans," i said, immediately wonder how i could swing 
it. "but you never know." 

i wasn't entire sure how to approach steve anymore. there was 
something about the abrupt way he took off that left things up in the 
air. a tiny sliver of uneasy was slip into my head-over-heels 
trust, the camel's nose under the tent. 

"first the good news," i declared. "david's talk to ore about a 
theatrical release for _baby love_." 

steve knew how deep i long for a theatrical--it would be my 
first--and he enthuse appropriately. but he also knew i wouldn't call 
him early sunday morning just to tell him that. there was only one 
other thing that would inspire such an unsocialized act. 

"uh, should i be ask how the other baby project is going?" he said. 

for a moment i wasn't sure what to say, since i didn't really even know 
myself. 

"still a work in progress," i said finally. then; "honey, i've just 
been to see a doctor who's . . . well, he's a little unconventional. 
and nervous-making. but everything else has failed." 

whereupon i gave him a quick, cell-phone summary of what i'd just been 
through at quetzal manor. 

"so are you go to go back eventually?" he sound uneasy. "for the 
full 'program'?" 

he had a way of zero in on essentials. the truth was, my baby hope 
and my sense of self-preservation were at war with each other. . . . 

"morgy, are you there?" 

"i'm here. and i guess the answer is, i'm still try to decide. like 
i said, he's into eastern medicine and native america . . . i'm not 
sure what. but if i need you, are you still in the project?" 

"what do you mean?" 

"darlin', don't play dumb. you know exactly what i mean. could you come 
back if i need you? really need you?" 

there was a long pause, wherein the millisecond drag by like hours. 
tree were gliding past, throw shadow on 

my windshield, and i still felt vague dizzy. i also had a residual 
ache in my abdomen where alex goddard had given me those damn 
muscle-relaxant shots. why was i even considering go back? 

finally: "you're not making this easy, you know. down here, without our 
. . . project on the front burner every day, i've been reassess . . 
. well, a lot of things. if we had a baby, it would turn our lives 
upside down. i mean, it's not like we just bought a sheepdog and 
chip in on the grooming. this is a human life we're talk about. 
are we really prepared to do justice to a child?" 

there it was. i didn't know whether i want to burst into tears, or 
strangle the man. 

"well, why don't you just think about it," i told him. "this doesn't 
sound like a conversation we should be have on a cell phone." blast 
him. "if that's the way you feel now, then i might just have a baby on 
my own." how, i wasn't sure. i'd been so certain we were a couple, i'd 
not given it any real thought. "or then again, i might just go ahead 
and adopt, with or without you." 

"look, i'm not saying i won't do it. i'm just saying it's not a trivial 
thing." he paused. "so where do that leave us?" 

translation: second thoughts. 

"i don't know where that leaves us, steve. in the shit, i guess. but 
i'd still like to know if i can count on you, or am i go to have to 
go to a sperm bank or something?" 

"jesus. let me think about this, okay? do i have to answer you now?" 

"no. but i'm not go to wait forever either." 

"all right." then he paused. "morgy, i miss you. i really do. i just 
need some time to think about our next step. are you sure you're okay? 
you sound a little out of it." 

"thanks for asking. i've just got a lot on my mind." 

turmoil, dismay, and hope, all toss together, that was what i had on 
my mind. i really didn't need mixed signal from steve at the moment. 

a few more awkward pleasantry and i click off the phone, wipe the 
streak from my cheeks, and abrupt sense alex goddard's face 
floating through my psyche. why was that? then i look down at the 
bottle on the seat beside me, the "herbal extracts" ramala had given 
me on the way out. what, i wondered, should i do about them? for that 
matter, what were they anyway? and what did they have to do with 
"centering"? if i start on his homeopathy treatments, what would i 
be get into? then i lecture myself: never take something when you 
don't know what it is. 

hannah klein. that's who i should ask. 

i was so focused, i pushed the number i had store for her in my phone 
memory before i remember it was sunday. instead of get her 
office, i got an answer service. 

"do you want to leave the doctor a message?" a southern-sounding voice 
enquired. 

without thinking, i heard myself declaring, "no, this is an emergency." 

what am i saying? i ask myself. but before i could take it back, 
hannah was on the line. 

i know how intrude on i feel when an actor call me at home on sunday 
to bitch. better make this good, i told myself. 

"i was at an infertile clinic yesterday and pass out," i began. 
"and now i have some herb to take, but i'm . . . well, i'm not sure 
about them." 

"what 'clinic'?" she asked. there was no reprimand for calling her on 
sunday morning. 

when i told her about alex goddard, she said little, but she did not 
sound impressed. loom there between us like the dead elephant on the 
living room floor was the fact that she'd specifically warn me not to 
go near him. and after what had just happened, there was a good case 
she might be right. 

"can i buy you brunch?" i finally asked, hope to lure her back onto 
my case. "i'd really like to show you these herb he gave me and get 
your opinion." 

"i was just head out to zabar's to get something," she said, somewhat 
icily. well, i suppose she thought she had good reason. "i'll get some 
bagel and meet you at my office." 

sunday traffic on upper broadway was light, and i luck out and found 
a parking space roughly two block from her building. it was one of the 
low-overhead "professional" type with a single small elevator and no 
doorman. when i got there, the lobby was empty. 

her suite was on the third floor, and i rang the bell before i realize 
the door was open. she was back in her office, behind the reception 
area, taking off her coat, when i march in. 

while she was unwrapp her sesame bagels, smoke sturgeon, and cream 
cheese with chives, she got an earful. my feeling was i'd better talk 
fast, and i did. i told her everything i could think of about what had 
happen to me at quetzal manor. i didn't expect her to make sense of 
it from my secondhand account, but i want to set the background for 
my next move. 

"when i was leaving, his assistant gave me these two bottle of 
gel-caps. she said they're special herbal extract he make from plant 
in the rain forest. do you think i ought to take them?" 

i suspect i already knew the answer. given her previous voice 
view on alex goddard, i doubt she would endorse any potion he might 
dispense. but plant medicine has a long history. at least she might 
know if they present any real danger. 

she was schmeare cream cheese on the bagels, but she put down the 
plastic knife, took the two bottles, and examine them skeptically. 

"these are not 'herbal extracts,' " she declared give her first 
analysis before even opening them. "they're both manufacture drugs. 
the gel-caps have name on them. it's a latin america pharmaceutical 
company." 

then she open the first bottle, took out one of the caps, crush it 
between her fingers, and sniffed. 

"uh-huh, just what i thought." then she touched a pinch of the white 
powder to her tongue. "right." she made a face and wipe her tongue 
with a tissue. "except it's much strong than the usual version. i can 
tell you right now that this drug, in this potency, is illegal in the 
u.s." 

what was it? i wondered. cocaine? and how could she tell its potency 
with just a taste? then i remind myself why i'd come to her in the 
first place: she'd been around the track many, many times. 

"it's gonadotropin," she said glaring at me. like, you damn fool. 
"i'm virtually certain. the trade name here in the u.s. is pergonal, 
though that's not what this is. this is a much strong concoction, and 
i can see some impurities." she settled the bottle onto her desk with 
what seem almost a shudder. "this is the pharmaceutical equivalent of 
hundred-and-ninety-proof moonshine." 

"what is it? what's it supposed it do?" jesus, i thought, what's he 
give me? 

"it's a hormone extract from the urine of menopause women. it 
trigger a greater than normal egg production and release. it's 
sometimes prescribed together with lupron, which cause your body to 
release a similar hormone. look, if you want to try pergonal, the real 
version, i'll write you a prescription, though i honestly don't think 
it's go to do you the slightest bit of good." 

i couldn't believe what i was hearing. i'd almost been considering 
give alex goddard the benefit of the doubt, at least till i found out 
more about him, and now he hand me this. 

now we both were look at the other bottle. 

"what do you think that is?" i asked, pointing. 

she broke the plastic seal, open it, and look in. it too was a 
white powder seal in gel-caps, and she gave one a sniff, then the 
taste test. 

"i have no idea." 

she set the bottle back on her desk, and i stare at it, terrify of 
what it might be. finally i got up my courage and reach for it. a 
white sticker had been wrap around it, with directions for taking . 
. . whatever it was . . . written on it. then i happen to notice that 
one corner show the edge of another label, one beneath the 
hand-applied first one. i lift a letter opener off her desk and 
manage to get it under the outer label. with a little scrape and 
tugging, i got it off. 

"does this mean anything to you?" i ask her, hand it back. "it's 
in spanish, but the contents seem to be hmg massone." 

"i don't believe it," she said, taking the bottle as though lift a 
cobra. i even got the distinct feeling she didn't want to leave any 
fingerprint on it. "that's an even more powerful drug to stimulate 
ovarian follicle and induce superovulation. it's highly illegal in 
this country. anybody who give these drug in combination to a patient 
is flirt with an ethics charge, or worse." 

i think i gasped. what was he try to put into my body? 

she settled the bottle back on the desk, her eyes grow narrow. 
"since you say his 'nurse' or assistant or whatever she was gave you 
this, i suppose there's always the chance she made an innocent mistake. 
but still, what's he do with this stuff at all? they manufacture it 
down in mexico, and also, i've heard, somewhere in central america, but 
it's not approve in the u.s. anybody who dispense this to a patient 
is putt their license at risk." she pause to give me one of those 
looks. "assuming alex goddard even has a medical license. these 
'alternative medicine' type sometimes claim they answer to a higher 
power, they're board-certified by god." 

"i don't for a minute think it was an 'innocent mistake.' " i was 
beginning to feel terribly betray and violated. i also was get 
mad as hell, my fingertip tingling. "but why would he give me these 
drug at all? did he somehow--?" 

"i think you'd better ask him," she said passing me a bagel pile high 
with cream cheese and sturgeon. 

she bit into her own bagel and for a while we both just chew in 
silence. i, however, had just lost all my appetite. alex goddard who 
might well be my last chance for a baby, had just dispense massive 
dose of illegal drug to me. which, my longtime ob/gyn was warning me, 
were both unnecessary and unethical. 

"what do you think i should do?" i ask finally, break the silence 
but barely able to get my voice out. 

she didn't say anything. she'd finished her bagel, and now she'd begun 
wrapping up the container of cream cheese, fold the wax paper back 
over the remain sturgeon. i thought her silent treatment was her way 
of telling me my brunch consultation was over. she clearly was 
exasperate with me. 

"let me tell you a story," she said finally, as she careful began 
putt the leftover sturgeon back into the zabar's bag. "when i was 
eight years old all the jew in our polish ghetto were starve because 
the nazi refuse to give us food stamps. so my father bribe a nazi 
officer to let him go out into the countryside to try to buy some egg 
and flour, anything, just so we could eat. the farmer came that 
saturday morning in a horse-drawn wagon to pick up my father. at the 
last minute, i ask to go with him and he let me. that night the nazi 
liquidate our entire ghetto, almost five thousand people. no one else 
in my family survived. not my mother, not my two sisters, not anyone." 

her voice had become total dispassionate, matter-of-fact, as though 
repression of the horror was the only way a sane person could deal with 
it. she could just as easily have been describe a country outing as 
she continued. i did notice, however, that her east europe accent had 
sudden become very prominent, as though she was return there in 
her thoughts. 

"when we learned what had happened, my father ask the farmer we were 
visiting to go to a certain rural doctor we knew and beg him to give us 
some poison, so we could commit suicide before the nazi got us too. 
the doctor, however, told him he had only enough poison for his own 
family. he did, however, give him a prescription for us. but when my 
father beg that farmer to go to a pharmacy and get the poison, he 
and his entire family refused. instead, they hid us in their barn for 
over a year, even though they knew it meant a fire squad if the nazi 
found us." she glare at me. "do you understand what i'm saying? they 
told us that if we want to do something foolish because we were 
desperate, we would have to do it without their help." 

it was the first time i ever knew her real story. i was stunned. 

"what, exactly, are you driving at?" i think i already knew. the long, 
trust relationship we'd share was now teeter on the brink. by 
go to see alex goddard--even if it was partly a research trip to 
check him out--i had disappointed her terribly. she'd lost respect for 
me. she thought i was desperate and about to embark on something 
foolish. 

"i'm saying do whatever you want." she got up and lift her coat off 
the corner rack. "but get those drug out of here. i don't want them 
anywhere near this office. i try everything legal there was to get 
you pregnant. if that wasn't good enough for you and now you want to go 
to some quack, that's your affair. let me just warn you that combine 
gonadotropin and hmg massone at these dosage is like putt your 
ovary on steroids; you get massive egg production for a couple of 
cycles, but the long-term damage could be severe. i strong advise you 
against it, but if you insist and then start have complications, i 
would appreciate not being involved." 

translation: if you start fool around with alex goddard, don't ever 
come back. 

it felt like a dagger in my chest. what was i go to do? one thought: 
okay, so these drug aren't the way, but you couldn't help me get 
pregnant. all i did was spend twenty thousand dollar on futile 
procedures. not to mention the heartbreak. 

"you know," i said finally, maybe a little sharply, "i think we ought 
to be working together, not at cross-purposes." 

"you're welcome to think what you like," she bristled. "but i have to 
tell you i don't appreciate your tone." 

i guess i'd really tick her off, and it hurt to do it. then, finally, 
her own rejection of me was sink in. 

"so that's it? you're telling me if i try anything except exactly what 
you want me to, then just don't ever come back." 

"i've said all i intend to." she was resolute usher me toward the 
door, her eyes abrupt blank. 

well, i told myself, go from anger to despair, then back to anger, 
whatever else i might think about alex goddard, at least he doesn't 
kick people out because of their problems, even a sad soul like tara. 

still, what about these illegal drugs? there i was, caught in the 
middle--between an honorable woman who had failed, and alex goddard, 
who'd just live up to my worst suspicions. heading down in the 
elevator, alone, i could still hear hannah klein's rejection, and 
warning, ring in my ears. maybe she had just confirmed that still, 
small voice of rational lecture me from the back of my mind. 

i march out onto the empty sunday street of upper broadway, and when 
i got to the corner, i stood for a long moment look up at the 
pitiless blue of the sky. the sun was there, but in my soul i felt all 
the light was gone. 

finally i open the first bottle and then, one by one, i began taking 
out the gel-caps and drop them into the rainwater grate there at my 
feet, watch them bounce like the metal sphere in an old pinball 
machine before disappear into the dark below. when both bottle 
were empty, i toss them into the wire trash basket i'd been standing 
next to. 

the next time i saw alex goddard, he was go to have a hell of a lot 
of explain to do. beginning with why he'd given me a glimmer of 
hope, only to then cruel snatch it back. i found myself hate him 
with all my being. 




chapter ten 


i head on back downtown, plan to take a bath, change clothes, and 
then recalibrate my game plan. maybe, i thought, i ought to just go up 
to the edit room at applecore, try some rote work to help 
tranquil my thoughts. 

but first things first. about halfway there, at thirty-eighth street, i 
pull over and double-parked by a korea deli, and survey the 
flower they had out front, an array of multicolore bloom that 
virtually block entry to the doorway of the tiny grocery. azaleas, 
chrysanthemums, birds-of-paradise, but i want the pink roses. at ten 
dollar a bunch, they seem the right touch. i dug out a twenty and 
picked two. 

still standing on the street, i pull them to me and inhale deeply. 
as far back as i could remember, i'd always love the scent of roses. 
i'd never really thought myself pretty, the natural-blond 
often-dyed-brown hair notwithstanding, but just have rose around 
somehow made me feel that way. i want to be engulf in them, 
especially any time confusion threaten to get the upper hand. 

five minutes later and i was at twenty-first street. i'd arrived. my 
refuge, my one-bedroom cocoon. time to collapse into a hot bath, wonder 
why alex goddard had given me illegal drugs, and contemplate roses. i 
was look for a parking space when my cell phone rang. no, don't 
bother, i told myself. enough intrusion for one day. then i remember 
i'd sprung for the caller-id feature, and i glance down at the little 
liquid crystal slot. it was a number i happen to know, lou's place 
downtown. one eye still on the street, i reach over and picked it up. 

"finally got you," he boomed. "where the heck are you?" 

"i just got home from--" 

"yeah, i know where you been. dave told me." he paused, as though he 
was holding off on some important announcement. "hang on a sec. there's 
somebody here might like to speak to you." 

i thought about lou's makeshift digs, lot of 
"heirloom"--worn-out--family furniture he'd lug along with him. 
sarah and i use to play on the couch, and it still had a dim mauve 
stain where i'd once dump a glass of "grape" kool-aid on her head 
when she was six. whatever else, definitely not a soho look. 

then i heard a whispery voice. 

"hi, morgy." 

it was a tentative utterance i'd heard only once before, when she was 
waking up after fall off a playground swing. she'd been knock out 
cold for a moment and i'd been frantic, wetting a handkerchief in the 
nearby fountain and desperate rubbing it over her face. when she came 
to, she'd gaze up into my eyes and greet me as though we'd just met. 

my god! 

before i could recover and say anything, lou came back on. "we're 
practice eat chicken-noodle soup. and we're try to do a little 
talking. why don't you come on down? she ask about you early this 
morning, said, 'where's morgy?' " 

"lou! this is incredible!" 

"you gotta believe in miracles, right? just come on down." 

"is she . . . god, you've got it." my hope went into orbit as i 
click off the phone and rev my engine. 

i could have swamp him with a lot of question then and there, but i 
immediately decided i want to see her first, with my own eyes. i 
still couldn't quite believe it was true. on the other hand, a weekend 
partial recovery was not total beyond the realm of medical 
possibility. with a coma, so little is understood that anything's 
possible. lou was right. this was definitely a weekend of the 
unexpected. 

i'd been close to the death of people near to me, both my parent for 
starters, but i'd never been close to the restoration of life. it's 
hard to explain the rush of joy when you think somebody is gone for 
good and then they pop up again, like they'd never been lost. and with 
sarah that feeling was especially jarring. it was almost as though some 
part of me had come back alive. 

the fact is, since sarah and i were both only children, we'd identify 
a lot with each other. true, we'd traveled our separate paths, each 
looking, perhaps, for something to fill the lonely void in our lives 
that a sibling might have taken. as a child of the dusty, empty plain 
of west texas, i didn't see other kid very much during the summer, and 
i made up reason why she and i should visit each other as often as 
possible. 

once, when i was plowing, turning over oat stubble--yes, my dad warily 
let me do that if i asked--i unearth a rabbit nest full of little 
baby cottontails. sarah was coming to visit the next day, and i rescue 
the infant so we could play nursery. we fed them milk with little 
eyedroppers, and before long sarah decided she was actually a 
reincarnate mother rabbit. that was when she became a vegetarian, and 
she remain so--by her account--till she finished college. it was just 
another of those magic moments of childhood i end up share with her. 

i also sometimes wondered, as you might have guessed, what it would've 
been like to be born a boy. i was definitely a tomboy, had a real 
collie (my own version of lassie), like to climb tree and dig hole 
in the hardscrabble west texas earth. maybe that was why i felt so at 
home--free associate now--when i film my documentary of the maya 
village in mexico's yucatan. it was hot and dry and lay under a 
pitiless sun, a blazing white bone in the sky that sear the spare 
landscape. none of my crew could understand how anybody could bear to 
live in such a place, but to me it seem perfectly natural, almost 
like home. 

thought of which now made me sad. i only wish my parent had live 
long enough to see that documentary. maybe then they'd have understood 
how terribly lonely i'd been as a child, a lonely i share so 
deep with sarah. would we ever be together again? 

on my hurried trip downtown, i kept wonder what i was about to 
encounter. was it go to be the fantasy-bound sarah of her girlhood, 
perhaps the same sarah who'd spun out some stutter vision of a jade 
mask? or would all that be past and would she again be the ambitious, 
sparkle pre-med student she'd become when she was in college? 

get to soho took only about ten minutes, scant time to think. lou's 
place was in what had once been a garment factory sweatshop. he'd 
rent it from another agent at the bureau, who had inherit it from a 
cousin, a well-known downtown artist, lately dead of aids. lou paid 
virtually no rent, was there mainly to keep out squatters, and couldn't 
care less that he was living in one of new york's trendy sections. 
all he knew was that there was plenty of room, and free parking on the 
street for his old buick. 

i'd been down many times before. inside, the space was still inhabit 
spiritual by the dead artist, with acrylic paint spatter on wall 
and graffiti i didn't fully understand in the bathroom. the place 
seem to be a broom-free area, with layer of the past litter on the 
floor like an archaeology excavation. and the old kool-aid-stained 
furniture, fitting right in. 

what always struck me, though, was the number of photo of sarah. they 
were everywhere in the open space, on tables, the desk, several on the 
walls. mostly they were old, several blown up and crop from 
snapshots, grainy. the space felt like a shrine to her memory. 

when lou let me in, i was greet by a spectral face, a wheelchair, and 
a valiant attempt at smile normalcy. maybe lou thought it was real, 
was progress, but i was immediately on guard. 

it was sarah's eyes that caught me. they pierce into my soul and we 
seem to click, just like always, only this time it was as though all 
our life together pass between us. i had the sense she was try to 
tell me something with her eyes that went beyond words, that she was 
try to reach out to me, perhaps to recapture that share 
understanding we'd had years ago. 

lou introduce me to a mrs. reilly, a kindly, irish-looking practical 
nurse who was part of the outpatient package the hospital provided. she 
wore a white uniform and was around sixty, with short-bobbed gray hair 
and an air of total authority. she'd just finished feed sarah a bowl 
of soup, and was brush out her crop blond hair, what there was of 
it. 

mrs. reil glance at me, but never broke the rhythm of her strokes. 
"she's tired now, but she's already strong than she was." 

then lou spoke up. "they call me early yesterday morning. but by the 
time i got around to try to reach you, you'd vanished. so i rang 
dave and he told me where you were, up there with that crackpot." he 
was grinning. no, make that beam like the famous cat. "by last 
night, she was walking with some help, so they said she might as well 
be here. like i said, it's a miracle." 

"you brought her home just this morning?" i couldn't believe the 
hospital would discharge her so soon, but this was the hmo age of 
medical cost-cutting. 

"only been here a couple of hours." he pointed to a shiny set of 
parallel steel railing in the corner. "that's for physical therapy. 
right now she can only walk with somebody on either side holding her, 
but in a few days, i figure . . ." his voice trail off, as though he 
didn't want to tempt fortune. then he turn toward sarah. "in a few 
days, right, honey?" 

she nodded, then finally spoke directly to me. "morgy, i want some 
clothes. please. i hate these horrible hospital things. i never want to 
see them again." 

i notice that she'd start crying, a line of tear down each 
emaciate cheek. was it something to do with seeing me? i wondered. 
then she began try to struggle out of the blue bed shift she was 
wearing, though she didn't have the strength. 

"i'll get you something great, sar, don't worry." i reach to stay her 
hand. it was, i thought, extraordinarily cold, even though the loft 
itself was warm as toast. what kind of clothes should i buy for her? i 
found myself wondering. blouse with buttons? pullovers? what could she 
manage? maybe i'd bring some item from home first and let her try them 
out. we use to be about the same size, though now she was all skin and 
bones. 

i move a chair next to her, took her other hand, and lean as close 
as i dared. i desperate want to put my arms around her, but i 
wasn't sure how she would respond to my touch. her eyes, however, were 
clear and had never look a deep blue. "sar, what's the matter? 
why're you crying? you should be happy. your dad's right here and he 
love you and we're go to take wonderful care of you." 

"who? him?" she asked, look straight at lou, her blue eyes like an 
unblink camera's lens. 

the plaintive question took my breath away. hadn't they been talk 
for two days? 

"don't pay any attention when she say things like that," mrs. reil 
declared, her voice just above a whisper. "she's still not quite 
herself. she drift in and out." 

she seem to be drift in and out at the moment, though it was 
mostly out. 

then she look directly at me, only now her eyes were lose their 
laser-like focus, were start to seem glazed. "who're you?" she 
reach out and touched my unwashed hair, running her hand through the 
tangle strands. 

next she stare off, terrified, her eyes full of fear. 

"the smoke," she whispered. "the knife. i'm next." 

abrupt she was off again in the reverie that had enfold her that 
first time in the hospital. or at least that was what i guessed. 

"what are you talk about?" i felt like shake her, except i was too 
shook-up myself. 

she turn back, and for a moment she just stare glassy-eyed, first at 
me, next at lou, and finally at mrs. reilly. then she reach for a 
glass of orange juice on the table beside her. she look at it as 
though it were some potion, then slow drank it off, not pause once. 
outside, a faint police siren could be heard, and i was afraid it was 
distract her. anyway, something told me her momentary séance was 
play out. her face had grown calm and rested, though i could barely 
repress a tremble. 

"whatever you think," i said finally, slip an arm around her 
shoulder, "we're both right here. and we love you and we want to help 
you get better." 

she didn't say anything more, just closed her eyes and drift away. 
but it wasn't back into a coma, since her breathing was grow 
heavier. i want to grab her and yell at her and demand that she come 
back to us, but i was fearful of what effect it might have. 

"what the hell was she talk about?" lou ask finally, his voice 
quavering. 

"i don't know," i said, as puzzle as he was. 

that was when mrs. reil spoke up. she was the only one not upset. 

"when they come out of a coma, sometimes they're not right for a 
while." she pat sarah's hand then gave it a solicitous squeeze. "i 
once had a man wake up and start talk about magic trip through the 
air, about how he was a dual citizen of the earth and the sea. he was 
talk like a lunatic. one day he would know his family, and the next 
he would look at them and start scream they'd come to kill him. you 
just never know how these things will go at first. but she'll be 
herself before long." she lift sarah's limp hand up to her cheek, 
then kiss it. "you're go to be all right, dear. i've seen enough 
like you to know." 

"then what do you make of what she just said?" lou ask her, have 
given up on me. "earlier this morning she was fine. knew who i was, 
everything. then the minute morgan come in, she start making up that 
loony jabber." 

the sanguine mrs. reil just shrug as if it didn't really matter. 

for my own part, i didn't necessarily like him imply my arrival had 
cause her to relapse into her dream world of terror. it seem to me 
that whenever i show up, she start try to tell me what was 
really eat away at her soul. 

well, i told myself finally, maybe she's regress back to when we were 
kids, when we only had each other to share our secret with. what if 
we've rebonde in some new, spe 

cial way? it would be natural, actually. she's try to reach out to 
me, like long ago. 

now she appear to be doze off, exhausted, her head tip downward 
toward her blue hospital shift. mrs. reil took that as a hint, and 
slow began wheeling her toward the bedroom, leave me alone with lou. 

i glance over at him, thinking more and more that i had to do 
something, track down what had happen to her. i want to do it for 
me, but even more for him. i'd never seen him so despondent. maybe it 
was the thing scholar call the curse of rising expectations. back when 
she was hardly more than a vegetable, he was overjoyed by a flicker 
eyelid. now that she was talking, he want all of her back. instead, 
though, it seem as if she had return to us for a moment, only to be 
snatch away again. i could tell it was killing him. 

"look, i'm sorry that when i show up, she start go off the deep 
end." i want desperate to help, but at that moment i felt 
powerless. "maybe i should just stay away for a while." 

"nah, she love have you here. don't worry. but anyway, dave said 
something about you taking a couple of days off. maybe i can use that 
time to be here with her and settle her down." then he grim took out 
her locket and rub its worn silver in his fingers, his eyes brim 
with his heartache. "this is all just so damn confusing." 

was he telling me, indirectly, that i should go away and leave them 
alone? first hannah klein reject me, and now _et tu_, lou? maybe, i 
thought, he's taking out his despair on me, blame me for her relapse. 
truthfully, i guess i was blame myself a bit too. 

"listen, i'm go to go home now and leave you two alone," i said. 
"but why don't you see if you can get her to talk some more? without me 
around, maybe she'll make more sense." 

"if she wants to say something, i'll listen." he gave me a strong, 
absent embrace, his eyes still despondent. "but no way am i gonna start 
push her." 

i edge into the bedroom, unsure if i really should, to say good-bye to 
sarah and to give her one last hug. her eyes were open again and she 
just stare at me for a second, then whisper a word i couldn't quite 
make out. it might have sound like "babylon," but that made no sense 
at all. finally she cover her eyes with her hand and turn away, 
gone from me, leave me more alone than i'd ever felt. 




chapter eleven 


heading home, finally, i told myself to try to calm down. i was 
determined to help sarah get over her trauma, though truthful i was 
too tired to really think straight at that moment. so instead i decided 
to let everything rest for a few hour and try for some distance. in 
fact, i began imagine myself in a hot bath, gaze at my now-wilting 
roses. home sweet home. 

mine was a standard one-bedroom in a building that had been turn into 
a co-op five years earlier, the owner offering the individual 
apartments to the tenants. i'd stay a renter, however, passing up the 
"low" insider price, $138,000, because i didn't really have the money, 
and when i did have it someday i would want something bigger. i wish 
i had more space--a real dine room and a big bathroom would do for 
starters, along with some place for more bookcases. and if a baby 
should someday miraculous come along . . . 

i'd often thought you could tell a lot about somebody from where and 
how they lived; it's revealing as a rorschach test. what, i often 
wondered, did my apartment say about me? 

a decorator might conclude i'd done up the place with love, then lazy 
let it go. they'd decide i care about nice things, but once those nice 
things were there, i neglect them. it would be true. 

i'd cover the wall of the living room with pale blue cloth, then 
hung a lot of frame pictures and old movie posters. okay, i like 
movies. for me even the poster are art. my couch was an off-white, 
more like dirt-colored actually, and cover with pillow for the 
"feminine" touch. i'd hope you'd have to look twice to realize it was 
actually a storage cabinet in disguise, with drawers along the bottom 
of the front. the floor was polish hardwood, rug from india here and 
there, in sore need of a vacuuming, and even a couple of deceased 
insect that'd been there for over a week. that sort of said it, i 
thought glumly. i'm a workaholic slob. 

the bedroom reveal even more about me. the bed was a brass 
four-poster, queen-size, partly cover by an heirloom quilt. it hadn't 
been made in a week. (who has the time?) the room itself was long and 
divide into area for work and sleep. opposite the bed itself was an 
antique english desk, on which sat my old macintosh, and next to that 
was my file cabinet, the indispensable part of the "home office" the 
irs love to hate. on top of it was a stack of marked-up scripts, note 
scribble all over them in six different colors. you never realize 
movies are so complicated till you see a breakdown sheet. camera angle 
and voice-overs and . . . 

next to the bed was a violin case and three books about indian ragas. 
what was that about? somebody might wonder. some kind of indian music 
nut? i was, albeit a very minimal talented nut. 

the kitchen was the new york efficiency kind paint a glossy tan, the 
color of aerosol olive oil. the cabinet contained mostly package of 
pasta, instant soup, and coffee filters. not even any real food. i live 
on deli takeout these days. an inventory of my fridge at this moment 
would clock two carton of "fresh squeezed" orange juice, a half quart 
of spoil milk, a bag of coffee beans, plastic container of wilt 
veggy from the corner salad bar, and three bottle of new york 
seltzer. that was it. 

god help me, i thought, my mind-state turning even more 

morose. this is my life. i had become that retrograde woman of the 
nineties: works ninety hour a week, make ninety thou a year, weigh 
ninety pounds, and think (pardon my french) cooking and fucking are 
provinces in northern china. well, the ninety-pounds part of that 
obscene quip didn't fit--and it wasn't the ninety anymore, anyway. 

in any case, was my apartment a place to raise a child? no earthly way. 
like carly, i'd have to spring for some decent space, preferable with a 
washing machine. . . . 

a parking slot was open right in front of my building, a minor miracle 
on this day of uncertain events. as i was pull in, i glance over to 
see a man walking past, not catching the face but sense something 
familiar in the walk. he was in the process of unbuttone a federal 
express uniform, peel away the top to reveal a dark suit. he 
certainly seem to be in a big hurry, carry an unmarked shop 
bag. maybe, i thought, his shift was over and he was meeting his wife, 
or a friend. 

i wonder if he'd left a package for me, and told myself to check with 
the super. not the usual delivery guy--did they come on sunday 
now?--and also . . . 

where was the truck? they always park right here by the building. 

i was still so upset over sarah, i couldn't immediately process those 
illogical observations, so i just grab my pink roses, dripping from 
the bottom of their paper wrapping, and open the car door. it was 
definitely good to be home. i love my chelsea neighborhood, where you 
got to know the locals, running into them in the delis, the little 
restaurants, the dry cleaners. just like a small town. if you work at 
home, the way i sometimes did, you even got to know the mailman and the 
delivery guy for ups and fedex. . . . 

hey! that guy. i finally placed the walk, a kind of a strut. he was the 
slimeball who'd been outside paula marks' building last week, carry 
a gun and threaten me. what's he do here? 

my pulse went off the charts. was he one of nicky russo's wiseguy crew 
after all? had he come back, with his pistol, to pay me a return 
engagement? 

my god. 

chill out, i told myself, take a deep breath. he's leaving. just try 
and find out who he is. 

rose in one hand held up awkward around my face, i slow amble 
down the street after him. i didn't have to go far. within about a 
hundred feet, he unlock a long black lincoln towncar, step out of 
the fedex camouflage, toss it onto the seat along with the bag he was 
carrying, pull the cap off his bald head got in, and sped away. 

the license plate look different from the usual, but i got what i 
needed: dl and a string of numbers. 

uh-oh, i thought. was he leave a package bomb for me? 

i turn back and let myself into the outer lobby, glancing around as i 
did. there were no parcel anywhere, just blank, brown tile. 

my apartment was 3a. the name on the bell was m. james. as i step 
through the inner lobby--still no package--a rumple face appear in 
the doorway just to my left. the sign on it, flaking, said super. 

"oh, hi." the voice was patrick mooney, our superintendent, who did not 
normally emerge to greet those arriving. but there had been complaint 
from the building's manage agent that he could never be found for 
emergencies, so he probably want to appear available, even on 
sundays. his voice was slur from some midday medicinal ireland whisky. 
"thought you were home. fedex guy was here early look for you." 

oh, boy. "did he leave a package?" 

"he had something with him, if that's what you mean. like a bag of some 
kind." 

"and you let him go up?" i couldn't believe what i was hearing. i felt 
a rush of dismay. 

"said he had to. need a signature." patrick mooney then shrug and 
reach for the dooijamb to steady himself, his whisky breath waft 
across the hall. great security. 

i step into the elevator as the door was clank shut, and watch 
as he rub his eyes and ease his own door closed. 

now i was really puzzled. if the fedex guy came "earlier," why was he 
just now leaving? a lot of scary theory went through my mind as i 
pushed the button for the third floor. 

i took a deep breath as the elevator opened, but again i saw no 
packages. so far so good. get off, i set down my rose on the hall 
carpet and fumble for my key. when i insert it, the lock felt a 
little rough, cause me to think for an instant i'd use the wrong 
key, but then it responded. 

what had cause that? i wondered. had the guy been fiddling with my 
door, wiring a bomb? use one hand i pushed it open, again holding my 
breath and standing aside, but it open okay. i exhaled, then reach 
back to drag in the flowers. 

but if he didn't leave a package, what was he do here? casing out 
where i lived? plant a bug in the elevator? and why was he here so 
long? 

the place was dark when i step in, the drape drawn. i relocke the 
door, then survey the gloom. no explosions, so i guess he didn't 
plan to kill me. yet. here i was, home, safe and sound. i just stood a 
minute, still uneasy. 

then i remember the flowers, my dripping bouquet, and head for the 
kitchen. deal with them, and then maybe get a bottle of white wine out 
of the fridge and sip some in the bath. 

after my unnerve sequence with sarah, thought of go to the office 
had zero appeal. time to lighten up, way up. 

preoccupied, not look around, i stuff the rose into a vase by the 
sink, and then i thought again about the white wine and open the 
refrigerator. i'd still not bother to turn on any lights, but the 
kitchen and its ancient fridge were dim illuminate by the tiny 
window just across. i wasn't sure where i'd put the bottle, since i'd 
had to rearrange things to make room for the dup of carly's interview. 
(i was also plan to take home a safety dup of paula's interview 
sometime later in the week.) 

why was i do that? taking home copies? it was a sign of deep 
compulsion. you couldn't really make a professional-quality second 
negative from a first positive--by that time it would be 
third-generation--but i'd brought it anyway. now and then i just have a 
raw instinct that keeping a safety backup around is a good idea. but 
the canister had end up devour the entire lower shelf of the 
fridge. 

i open the white door and peer in. the light was out, and for a 
moment i stare numbly at the dark, half-filled shelves. the only thing 
that struck me as odd was that i could see the pure white of the empty 
bottom shelf. 

for a second i could only stand and stare, but then i back away, 
try to figure out what was wrong, and stumble over something. i 
regain my balance and flip on the overhead light. 

"what!" 

the floor around me was litter with bottles, my old toaster, my tiny 
microwave. it was a total shambles. 

i recoil stumble again, this time over can strewn across the 
linoleum. my kitchen, it was slow sink in, had been completely 
trashed. 

i felt a visceral wave of nausea. it's the scariest thing in the world 
have your space invade like a form of psychic rape. i sag against 
the refrigerator as i gaze around. the cabinet had been empty out, 
a hasty and haphazard search. quick and extremely dirty, as glass 
container of condiments, including an old bottle of dill pickles, were 
shatter and their contents smear into the floor. 

"i don't believe this." i march back into the living room and reach 
for the lights. this room too had been turn upside down. the tv, 
stereo, vcr, all had been swept onto the rug. but they were still 
there. that guy, that animal, who did this wasn't a thief. he'd been 
look for something. 

my breath now coming in pulses, i edge into the bedroom and switch 
on the light. the bed was the way i'd left it, the cover thrown back 
and the pillow in a pile. the clock radio was there, and so was the 
old mac, still on the table in the far corner, my "workstation." again 
nothing seem to be missing. 

i head back to the kitchen, where the refrigerator door was still 
open. i gaze at the interior a moment, still puzzled, try to figure 
out what wasn't right. . . . 

shit! shit! shit! that's what was wrong. the field of white bottom 
shelf was empty. total empty. the film canister of paula's interview 
was gone. 

for a moment i just lean against the kitchen counter, barely push 
aside an impulse to throw up in the sink. think, i told myself, get a 
grip and think. . . . 

it was the film he'd wanted. and he'd want it badly enough to pick 
the lock, then rip my home apart look for it. 

i pull at a tangle of hair, feeling my mind in chaos, and try to 
reason out the situation. why? why would he steal a positive that 
couldn't be use for anything? 

finally the real truth of what had happen hit me like a fist in the 
chest. my home sweet home had been violated. 

seething, i went into the living room and reach for the phone, the 
only thing not on the floor. 

my first instinct was to call david, but then i decided he'd just go 
into a tizzy of hysteria and be no support at all. so instead i call 
lou, pray i wouldn't wake sarah. in an unsteady voice, i try to 
tell him what had happened. 

he seem puzzle to hear from me again so soon, but then he quick 
turn fbi, concerned for my safety. 

"guy sound like a professional," he declared. "probably got in with an 
electric picker, like the edge. any asshole can buy one for a hundred 
and thirty bucks. it'll rake cylinder at a hundred times a second. pro 
like that, you can be sure there'll be no prints." 

"but why would . . . ?" my voice was still a croak. "i mean, my god, 
all for a lousy reel of film?" 

"fucker wants you to know he's in town. so how he did it's as important 
as what he did. it's a time-proven scare tactic." he paused. "morgan, i 
don't like this one bit. there could be more before this is over." 

"think i should call the cops?" 

"damned right you should," he said, slow and sadly, "but to tell you 
the truth, they ain't gonna do all that much. somebody mess up your 
apartment and lift a third-hand copy of a woman talking. they'll say 
it sound more like malicious mischief than a crime. then they'll write 
it up and that'll be the last you'll hear from them." 

"well," i said, my anger well up, "maybe i don't feel quite so 
laissez-faire. tell me, you know anybody who can run a plate for you on 
a sunday?" 

"you got the prick's license number?" he exclaimed. "why the hell 
didn't you say so?" 

"honestly, it sort of slip my mind. i'm have a little trouble 
thinking straight right now." 

fortunately my short-term memory is pretty good, even when i'm 
stressed, so i spew it out. 

"don't go anywhere," he declared. "i'll get back to you in five 
minutes." 

i hung up the phone and lay down, flat out on the carpet, try a 
breathing exercise to calm down. the problem was, it wasn't working. 
have had some experience with being robbed--i once got completely 
clean out when i had a ground-floor apartment down in the village--i 
know you go through certain kubler-ross-like stage of anger, denial, 
depression, acceptance. you also go through a predictable series of 
recriminations: i should have had window bar and gates; i should have 
had a different lock; i should have had two different locks. in the 
instance just recalled, i'm virtually certain an apartment painter 
duplicate a set of my key on his lunch break and then pass them on 
to a second-story artist. no way to prove that, mind you, but it had to 
be what happened. i also suspect he checked my appointments calendar to 
see when i was go to be out of town. 

but in this case the lock was definitely picked. nobody had a set of my 
key except the super, and steve. so the guy with the spain accent 
knew how to slip through door and he had no financial interest in my 
old vcr. he only had an interest in my film. what had he said there on 
the sidewalk outside paula marks's apartment? something about how 
making this picture was a big mistake? 

i jump as the phone erupt by my ear. 

"the name colonel jose alvino ramo grijalva mean anything to you?" lou 
asked. 

"how could it? i'm not sure i can even pronounce it." 

"well, colonel ramo declare himself to be a military attaché at the 
guatemala consulate here. you've got a big shot in the guatemala army 
rummage through your apartment. this is even worse than i thought. 
those guy are killers." 

"jesus." i was still coming to grip with the horrify fact he'd been 
in my apartment, in my only refuge. "think i could bring charge 
against him?" 

"well, let's consider this a minute. probably no prints, no credible 
witness. you'd have a damn hard time prove anything." he sighed. 
"truth is, i doubt you could even get a restrain order, given what 
little you've got to work with." 

"the bastard." i sat a moment, feeling the logical, left side of my 
brain just shut down. my mind went back to its most primitive level, 
running on adrenaline. "look, i need to check out something. i'll call 
you in the morning." 

"well, be careful," he said warily. "and for god's sake don't go 
running off anyplace alone. i'm telling you you're not safe. always be 
around people." 

"i'll keep it in mind." with that i gently hung up the phone and 
exhaled. 

think. some colonel from guatemala just broke into my apartment look 
for what i might know about children of light, where i've been go to 
see about have a baby. so why is he so interested in what i'm doing? 

i remember alex goddard want me to go to a "clinic" he had 
somewhere in central america. ten to one that clinic was in guatemala. 
that was what this whole thing was about. and now he'd just gone back 
there; at least that was what he'd said. 

guatemala was a long way off, but his other operation was right up the 
river. i hadn't seen all of it this morning, but that was about to 
change. a lot of things were about to change. it was time to start 
get the play field level again. 




chapter twelve 


i arrange with patrick mooney to have his sister in queens, a 
full-figured woman name rosalyn, come in and finish the job of 
reconstruct my wreck home. she arrive an hour and a half later, 
and was hard at work when i left. i also agonized over the 
police-report issue, but finally decided to forgo the bother. lou was 
right: it would be a two-hour ordeal of futility. besides, i had better 
things to do with my time. i was go to return the favor of an 
information-gathering expedition. 

alex goddard had said he'd be absent from quetzal manor--who know for 
how long--and this time around i was go to do the place right, the 
next step in my undercover research. the first, and main, thing i 
want to do was explore the new high-tech clinic that sat nestle in 
the wood across from the old building. everything about it was the 
exact opposite of a "manor." not a shred of new age "spirituality," 
just a lot of digital equipment and ultrasound and . . . what else? 
chief among my questions: what was behind that big, white door? 

maybe i was being impulsive, but i was completely wire and the truth 
was, i wasn't go to sleep till i knew a lot more than i did. and if 
i went late tonight, sunday, i probably wouldn't have to deal with 
ramala. 

i call roger drexel, my unshaven cameraman, and ask him to come up 
and meet me at applecore. it was sunday and he was watch the third 
quarter of a knick game and into his second six-pack, but he agreed. 
after all, i was his current boss. 

all i really want was his betacam and some metal tape, which would be 
broadcast quality. (i'd want to do it yesterday, but now the time had 
definitely come.) we met at the office, and he unlock the room with 
the camera gear and loaded in a fresh tape. with any luck, he made it 
home for the end of the game. 

i then had a sinful cheeseburger and fry at a greece diner two block 
down the avenue. it was my idea of a courage-bolstering indulgence. 

my watch read six thirty-five and daylight was wane when i rev my 
old toyota and start my northbound trek back to quetzal manor. when i 
was passing the george washington bridge, the first drift flake of 
a freak late-season snowstorm began pelt my windshield. good i 
thought, turning on my wipers, the less visibility, the better. at 
least i believe that till the road start get slippery and i had 
to throttle back. it was only then i realize i'd been push eighty 
on the speedometer, passing a lot of cars. lou's warning not to go 
anywhere alone was still file in the back of my mind but i kept try 
not to think about it. sometimes there are things you've just got to do. 

the highway grew more treacherous the farther north i went, but the 
traffic was thin out and by the time i reach the turnoff to 
quetzal manor, total dark had set in, in addition to which the 
paving was cover with at least an inch of sparkling-new pristine snow. 

as i ease up the roadway, my headlight made the tree around me 
glisten with their light dust of white, like frosting on the tip of 
a buzz cut. i switch off my lights as i made the last turn in the 
road but not before catching a glimpse of quetzal manor, and i must 
confess to feeling a shudder, of both anger and apprehension, run 
through me as i watch its magisterial turret disappear into the 
snowy dark. 

i park my car at the back of the lot and retrieve the flashlight i'd 
brought, a yellow plastic two-battery model. i hadn't realize there'd 
be snow when i left home, so i was just wearing some old sneakers, but 
they'd do. i then sat there in the dark for a long minute, listen to 
the silence and thinking. the first thing was to find out if anybody 
was guard the place. the next was to get some video of the new 
building. 

i grab the bag carry the betacam, test my flashlight against 
the floorboard, and then head up the snowy driveway. i march 
straight through the open arch that was the front door, and i was again 
in the drafty hallway where i'd met ramala saturday morning. it was 
empty and dark now, no lights anywhere, not even out in the courtyard 
beyond. the stony quiet--no music, no chants--felt unnatural, but it 
also suggest that alex goddard's adore acolyte were safe tuck 
away. early to bed . . . you know the rest. so maybe i really had come 
at the right time. 

a chilly wind was blow in from the far end of the hallway, and i 
felt like i'd just enter a dank tomb, but i tighten my coat and 
pressed on. when i got to the end and look out, the snowy courtyard 
was like a picture postcard. and completely empty. 

all right, i thought, move on to what you came for. 

but when i turn and head back down the hallway, toward the entry 
arch, i caught a glimpse of a furtive form, dark and shadowy, lurk 
just outside. shit! i froze in my tracks, but then the figure step 
inside, wearing something that made me think of little red riding hood, 
like a tiny ghost in a cowl. 

it was tara, alex goddard's spacey waif, who was moving so oddly, i 
thought for a moment she might be sleepwalking. 

she wasn't, of course. she'd just been out strolling around the 
driveway in the snow. i soon realize she live her life in something 
resemble a trance, as though she were a permanent denizen of the 
spirit world. for her it was a natural condition. 

"it's so beautiful like this," she mumble dreamily, as though we'd 
been in the middle of a lifelong conversation. "i just love it." her 
voice was barely above a whisper, but in the silence it seem to 
ricochet off the stone walls. "i want to take them out, show them god's 
paintbrush. will you help me?" 

"take who out?" i asked, immediately decide to go with the moment. 

finally she look directly at me and realize whom she'd been talk 
to. 

"you were here before. i try to give you herb to help you, but then 
he came and . . ." her voice trail off as she walk back through the 
portico and out again into the drift snow. then she held up her 
hands, as though attempt to capture the flake as keepsakes. "i so 
want to show them. they've never seen it before." she glance back at 
me. "come on. let's do it." 

as i follow her out into the drift white and across the parking 
lot, the accumulation of snow was grow denser, enough now to start 
covering the cars, but still, something told me the flurry was go to 
be short-lived. i took a long, misty breath of the moist air and 
click open the case holding the betacam, ready myself to take it 
out the minute we got inside. 

well, i thought, maybe i've gotten lucky. she was head for the new 
clinic, which was exactly where i want to go. it was nestle in the 
trees, up a winding pathway, and as i slog along i could feel the 
snow melting through my sneakers. 

when we got to the front door, large and made of glass, she just pushed 
it open. 

"we never lock anything," she declared, glancing back. "it's one of our 
rules." 

the hallway was dark, silent, and empty except for the two of us. 
still, i felt a tinge of caution as we entered. at some level this was 
trespassing. 

"come on," she said, casual flipping a switch on the right-hand wall 
and cause the overhead fluorescent to blink on. "he's away now, and 
everybody's in bed. but i'll bet they're still awake in here. it's a 
perfect time." 

i didn't feel anything was perfect, but i did know i want to learn 
what was behind the door i'd seen when i was leaving. it was at the end 
of the hallway, wide and steel and paint hospital white. and, sure 
enough, that was exactly where tara was heading. 

she just kept talk nonstop, in her dreamy, little-girl voice. "we've 
got to try and make them understand it's okay. that it'll be just for a 
minute." 

she shove open the door without knocking, and my ear were greet by 
the faint strain of beethoven's "moonlight sonata," one of my 
favorites. for an instant i was caught up in the music, a poignant 
moment drawing me in. 

the room itself was spacious, with a row of white bassinet along one 
side and subdued lighting provided by small fluorescent bulb along the 
walls. it was, i immediately realized, a no-frills nursery. alongside 
the bassinet were table with formula and box of pamper and 
handi-wipes. two short women of indefinable nationality--they look 
vague asian--were in attendance, and at the moment one was facing 
away and bouncing a baby on her shoulder. her infant look like a 
boy--or was that just my imagination?--and i felt my heart go out. the 
light was dim, but i could tell he was a gorgeous sandy-haired kid 
plump and peachy, so sublime in his tender vulnerable as he gaze 
around with eyes full of trust. he was staring directly back at me and 
before i could stop myself, i gave him a little wave and wrinkle my 
nose. he stare at me a second then respond with a tiny smile. hey, i 
thought, i've got the touch. 

"come on," tara said ignore the women, "let me show you. they're all 
so beautiful." 

by then my eyes were adjust to the subdued light, and as we walk 
down the middle of the long room, i confirmed my assumption that the 
bassinet next to the table all contained infants. i'm no expert on 
babies, but i'd guess they were all around six week old maybe a couple 
of month at most. 

this is the nest, i thought. ground zero. kevin and rachel were both 
probably in this room at one time too. . . . 

"aren't they wonderful?" tara was saying, still in her squeaky, 
spaced-out voice. 

i was opening the betacam bag when the first woman, the one holding and 
lightly bouncing her little boy, absently put her hand under his quilt, 
then spoke to the other in deep accent english. 

"he's wet again." 

it was the first words either of them had uttered. then she turn to 
me in exasperation, assuming, i suppose, that i was one of alex 
goddard's flock. "and i just change him." again the accent, but i 
still couldn't identify it. she made a face, then carry him over to a 
plywood change table in the center of the room. 

i felt a great baby-yearning as i move over beside her, but she was 
behave like a typical hourly wage-earner, glum go about her job, 
and i just stood there a moment, vain wanting to hold him, then 
turn back to tara. 

"where do all these children come from?" 

"ramala say they're orphan or abandoned or something. from overseas 
or wherever." she sighed. "they're so perfect." 

she was completely zombied-out. it felt like talk to a marshmallow 
on downers. 

"but how, exactly, do--?" 

"people bring them here." she seem uninterested in the question, just 
plunge on as she wander on down the line of bassinets. 

i'd finally come to my senses enough to take out the betacam, though 
the light wasn't actually enough to really work with, certainly not 
broadcast quality. 

she stop and picked up one of the infant out of its bassinet, then 
turn back to me, her eyes turning soft as she hug it the way she 
might a small puppy. "isn't this one cute? i'd so love to have him." 

was she on some kind of drug that suppress curiosity? i found myself 
wonder as i pan the camera around the room. there must have been 
at least twenty bassinets, all just alike, wicker with a white lace 
hood. a couple of the baby were sniffling, and the one tara had 
picked up now began crying outright, much to her annoyance. the room 
itself smell like baby powder. 

"and then what happens?" i ask finally, zoom in on one of the 
women. 

"what happen when?" now tara was twirl in a circle, hum 
futile to the shriek child. "you mean, after they come here?" 

"right." god, get answer from her was making me crazy. 

"the girl here take them to their new mothers." her eyes had turn 
even more dreamy as she lightly bounce the bawl bundle she was 
holding one last time, after which she return it to its bassinet. 
then she gaze around the room. "it's so sad to see them leave." 

did paula and car get their baby that way? i found myself 
wondering. probably, but it was one more thing i'd neglect to ask. 

"come on," tara continued. "let's take some of them out. he make the 
nurse try and speak english around the children, but they don't really 
know much. maybe you could figure out a way to, like, explain--" 

"tara, i don't think taking any of these baby out into the snow is a 
very hot idea. not tonight. maybe in the morning." stall her, i 
thought. she's completely out of it. then i look at the woman 
change the baby. sure enough, i was right. it was a boy. 

"but i want to." tara turn crestfallen. "to show them how beautiful--" 

"well, i don't speak whatever language they're speaking," i said, 
cutting cut her off. "i'm not even sure i could make it sound 
reasonable in english. so you'll have to do it without my help." 

then i turn to the woman who'd been change the baby. 

"do you know where this child came from?" why not take a shot? 

she just stare at me, alarmed, then turn away. nothing. she clearly 
wasn't go to tell me anything, even if she could. she and the other 
were just cheap hire help, probably illegal immigrant without a green 
card and scared to death for their jobs. they weren't go to be do 
an in-depth tell-all to anybody. 

i thought about the situation for a moment, and decided i'd seen what i 
came to see. this was pay dirt. alex goddard was running a full-scale 
adoption mill, just as lou had suspected. he was collect beautiful 
white baby from "overseas or wherever," and sell them here at 
sixty thousand a pop. 

which went a long way toward explain why he didn't want children of 
light to be feature in my film. and the guatemala colonel who'd just 
trash my home was almost certainly in on the operation. alex goddard 
might be a new age miracle worker rediscovere ancient native america 
herbal cures, but he also was running a very efficient money machine. 

still, the big question kept coming back: where did he get all the 
babies? to extract any more information about that from quetzal manor, 
i'd have to break into an office somewhere, and i wasn't quite up to 
that yet. i didn't have the nerve of colonel jose alvino ramos. 

"tell you what, tara, i think i'm out of here." i was return the 
betacam to its bag. nothing i'd shot was remotely broadcast quality, 
but i did have proof of what was go on. my "undercover" 
investigate was making some headway. 

"okay." she sigh her expression increasingly glazed. 

i took one last look around the room, at the row of bassinets, then 
gave her a parting pat and head for the exit. 

"look," i said turning back as i reach the door. "don't say anything 
to anybody about me being here tonight, okay? can we just let it be our 
secret?" 

"sure, whatever." she shrug absently. like, why not. 

"and tara, do yourself a favor. get out of this place." 

"but there's nowhere else i can go," she said sad in her eyes. as i 
slow closed the door, the last thing i heard was the sound of the 
beethoven sonata die away. 

what a day . . . and night. as i walk down the hallway carry the 
camera bag, i try to process my new information. i'd just seen some 
of the most incredible lovable baby ever. that part of it was a 
beautiful experience, one that pull at my heartstrings more strong 
than i'd ever imagine something like that could. the part that 
trouble me was, the baby were so alike, so fair, and . . . they all 
could have been perfect sibling for kevin and rachel. 

no, i told myself, surely that was my imagination. though they did look 
amazing related. . . . 

as i move across the parking lot, i thought i saw a movement in the 
shadow just inside the entry archway, a quick change in the pattern of 
dark. was it ramala or one of the girls, i wondered, or was it just my 
paranoia? 

keep walking, i told myself. lose yourself in the snow. the only way 
they can stop you from expose this racket now is to kill you. 

when i got back to my car, i gaze up at the imposing turret of 
quetzal manor one last time, wish there was enough light to film 
them, and collected my thoughts. was the story about the baby being 
orphan or abandoned children or "whatever" really true? i didn't 
believe it, not for a minute. 

but as car grove said, alex goddard could "make it happen." the 
problem for me was, he wouldn't tell me where he got the children, and 
nobody i'd talk to so far seem to want to know, not really. 

i want to know. 




chapter thirteen 


in moments i was heading down the snowy drive, south toward my home 
(which had been hopefully put back together). i pushed the pace, 
mesmerize by the snow, and try to decide what to do next. the thug 
ramo had stolen some second-generation interview footage from me, but 
now i had a tape of something a lot more interesting. 

when i pull into my street, the time was just past eleven and i was 
thinking about calling lou, or steve, or both. but then i saw something 
odd. a woman was walking down the steps from the lobby of my building, 
a woman i recognize from somewhere. 

her hair was tangle and she was wearing black jeans and a black 
sweater. it took a second before i finally process the fact it was 
car grove. and she seem frantic. i assume she'd come in a cab, but 
she had my home phone number, so why would she come over if i didn't 
answer? new yorker don't just drop in. a social no-no. 

maybe the reason had something to do with how she looked. i felt like i 
was seeing a specter. 

"thank god you're here," she blurt out, stride up. she was actually 
shaking, and i could tell she'd been crying. nothing like the gutsy 
woman i'd seen a few days earlier. "i kept get your machine, but i 
thought maybe you were hiding." 

i look at her, and forgot all about my own issues. it was hard to 
remember ever seeing a human being in such distress, except for sarah. 

"why would i be hiding?" i was taking out the betacam bag and close 
my car door, hope to seem normal and professional. 

"they call me about six o'clock tonight. children of light." she 
could barely get the words out. "they'd seen my interview with you. how 
did they get it?" 

i look down at the snowy--make that slushy--street and felt a chill 
go through me, follow immediately by anger. ramos, that bastard. 

"they . . . somebody took a copy this morning." state like that, it 
sound pretty lame. "i'm so sorry--" 

"he threaten kevin. he actually said if i sign a release to let you 
use the film, my child would 'meet with an accident.' and then he said 
something about you, that your own--" 

"who? who call you? did he tell you his--?" 

"he wouldn't give a name. just some man. he had a foreign accent." she 
threw her arms around me, and i hug her back as best i could. 

"where's kevin now?" i was so concerned about car that i'd repressed 
the information that he'd also mention me. 

"marcy was there, so i told her to take him with her. to her mother's 
place in the bronx, where she lives." car was still tremble as she 
loosen her grip on me. "i call a car service to drive them up." 

"well, come on in. let's talk." truthfully, i wasn't sure how much i 
want to tell her about what i'd just seen at quetzal manor. it would 
probably just distress her more. where had kevin come from? did i 
really want to de-legitimize him in her eyes? 

as i led her through the lobby, hope to appear composed, patrick 
mooney greet us, announce that his sister, rosalyn, had been gone 
for an hour and that she appreciate my memorable tip. 

the place look like nothing had happened, and car immediately 
collapse onto my "earth-tone" couch. i hadn't told her my apartment 
had been toss along with the robbery and, thanks to rosalyn, i didn't 
need to. in fact, it actually look cleaner than it had in months. 
maybe, i thought, i should reprioritize my life and hire her more often. 

then i got a glass of water for car and sat down next to her. 

"i'm really sorry," i began, deep meaning it. "if i'd known all this 
was go to happen, i'd never--" 

"it's not your fault." she took a long drink. i hadn't bother with 
ice, and i immediately felt i'd been inhospitable. kind of a vagrant, 
minor concern, considering. then she went on. "i guess i knew down deep 
i shouldn't have given you that interview. but i want the world to 
know about kevin. now, though . . . should i call the police or 
something?" 

the short answer to that was yes, but my mind was already skip on 
to a different topic. 

"carly, do you know where kevin came from? really came from? did you 
ever actually try to find out?" 

she sigh and took another sip. 

"i told you i don't care. when they brought him, all pink and helpless, 
i just--" 

"who brought him?" i interrupted. 

"well, i'd been up there the day before, sign all the papers. i was 
supposed to go up that day, but then somebody call and said one of 
the girl who was stay in the clinic or whatever it is was bring 
him to me. so don't come." 

"you're saying one of the girls--?" 

"yeah." she look wistful for a moment, as though remembering. "then 
she just show up, look like some blond college dropout. i guess a 
little more fanfare would've been nice, but marcy was there to help me 
and that was it. that's the last contact i ever had with children of 
light." she shudder involuntarily. "till now." 

well, i thought, the last thing i'm go to do is tell her about what 
i just saw. she's the ideal customer for alex goddard: she truly 
doesn't want to know details. 

"carly, there's not much i can do about what's already happened, but i 
can try to keep you from get into any more trouble. why don't you 
call them in the morning and tell them you've yell at me and 
rescind your permission for applecore to use the film? and say i've 
promise i won't. you've threaten to sue me or something. that should 
get you off the hook." 

"you really think so?" her look brighten slightly. 

"yes, it's me they're worried about, not you. i represent some threat 
to them, because of the film i'm making. just bail out and you'll be 
okay." 

"thanks. i did get the feeling that's all they really want." she took 
another drink of water. "but if they want to scare me, they're do 
a hell of a good job." 

"well, then, why not take kevin and go away for a couple of weeks? on a 
vacation someplace? and while you're do that, i'm go to have a 
one-on-one with alex goddard. i've got a little leverage now." 

she look at me. "what . . . what are you go to do?" 

i couldn't tell her about my videotape of his baby cache without 
explain a lot more about children of light than i thought she want 
to hear. 

"don't you think the less you know the better?" i said, taking her 
hand. "i've cause you enough trouble already." 

"no, i cause myself trouble." she was get up. "can i use your 
bathroom?" 

"sure." i pointed the way. 

while she was gone, i went to the kitchen and survey it, check the 
cabinets. again, the place was cleaner than it had been in ages. the 
look of it momentarily bucked me up. 

when car came back, she hug me and then announce she want to go 
check on kevin. 

"i'll do what you said about calling them," she concluded, reach for 
her bag. "i think you're right. that ought to get them off my case. at 
least for the moment. as for the long run--" 

"carly," i said, taking her hand again, "we'll get through this. just 
trust me." 

we hug one more time and then she was gone. i took the moment to 
double-lock the door, and then collapse on the couch. what should be 
my next move? i closed my eyes and try to review all the insidious 
things that had happen in the last twenty-four hours. the illegal 
drugs, the break-in and theft of my film, the suspicious nursery of 
children of light, the threat to car . . . 

then it finally came back that she'd mention ramo saying something 
about me. by now i was get use to being threaten by the man, so 
one more time was hardly news. but i wish i'd ask her the specifics. 

that was when i rouse myself and reach for the phone. the time was 
push eleven, but i still want to check in on sarah, see how she 
was doing. had she come back to reality after i left? 

i was listen to the phone ring, my mind drift to thought of how 
to gently ask lou about her, when i realize nobody was pick up. 

what's go on? i wondered, immediately coming alert. mrs. reil had 
probably gone home for the day, but no way would lou be in bed before 
midnight. he always had trouble settle into sleep. 

maybe, i then hoped, i'd just dial the wrong number. but when i try 
again, still no answer. 

i click off the phone and felt a wave of concern. if colonel jose 
alvino ramo could find out i was making a movie, and then find out 
where i lived, he sure as hell could locate my extend family. was 
that what he'd meant when he mention me to carly? 

i grab the set of lou's key i had store in my bedroom's desk 
drawer and flew out the door. 

the street were plastered with a grimy veneer of city snow, melting 
fast, but i pushed the limit of safety and ran a couple of lights 
since the traffic was spotty. there was a parking space just across the 
street from lou's building, and as i pull in i look over at his 
windows. 

through the curtains i could tell a dim light was on, probably coming 
from sarah's bedroom. the front room, however, was dark. 

my pulse was pounding as i race up the steps to the street door. i 
thought about push his bell, but i didn't have the patience. instead 
i just fumble with the key set till i found the biggest one and shove 
it into the lock. 

the building had no lobby, just a row of stairs leading up to the next 
floor, with lou's own door set off to the left. i shove his medeco key 
into the deadlock and pushed it open. the room was pitch-dark. 

"who . . ." said a startle voice, and i knew it was lou, somewhere in 
the direction of the couch. 

i click on the light switch and saw him lie on the floor, leaning 
against the couch, blood everywhere, his eyes in shock. 

"my god! what happened?" 

"i'm afraid to move. the phone was ring and i figured it was you, 
but i didn't dare get up. knowing you, you'd come over if i didn't 
answer." he was holding his side as he look at me. "morgy, she's 
gone." 

at first what he said didn't sink in as i bent over him. the right side 
of his shirt, just above his belt, was soaked in blood. taking care, i 
unbuttoned it and saw an open cut that look as though he'd been 
stab with a knife. it also appear to be reasonably superficial, as 
though a thin blade had pierce through a couple of layer of tread on 
his ample spare tire. but it was bleeding still, enough to make it look 
worse than it probably was. however, if it'd happen to me, i'd 
doubtless be in shock too. 

i got up, went to the bathroom, and pull two towel off the rack, 
then douse water over one and came back. 

"don't move. i'm go to pull your shirt away and try to clean you up, 
see how bad it is." 

he just groan and stare at the ceiling. 

as i was swab his side, what he'd said finally registered. 

"did you say . . . _sarah_!" 

i drop the towel and ran into the bedroom. 

it was empty, the bed rumple and beige sheet on the floor. 

"no." i turn and feeling a hit of nausea, hurried back to his side. 
"what happened? did--?" 

"fat hispanic guy. spy bastard. he had a couple of young punk with 
him. mrs. reil had just left and i went to the door, thinking it was 
probably you ring my bell. he flash a knife and they shove their 
way in. then one of his thug went into the bedroom and carry her 
out. when i try to stop them, the sob knife me. i guess i . . . 
swoon cause the next thing i remember is waking up here on the floor." 

it sound garble and probably didn't occur as quick 

as he thought. but i knew immediately what had happen ramos--of 
course that's who it was--had come to take sarah. it was his one sure 
way to stop me from mention children of light in my film. she was a 
hostage. my first instinct was to kill him. 

"what else can you remember?" i was already dial 911. time to get an 
ambulance. and after that, the cops. 

after about ten ring i got somebody and, following an explanation that 
was long than it need to be, a woman with a southern accent told me 
the medic would be there in fifteen minutes. i took another look at 
lou and ordered them to hurry, then hung up. i was go to call the 
police next, but first i need to hear exactly what had happen 
before he got quarantine in some emergency room. 

his eyes were glazing over again, as shock and blood loss start to 
catch up with him. clearly he would pull through, but right now, 
sitting there in a pool of blood, he could have been at death's door. 

"look . . . at that." he was pointing, his rational beginning to 
fail. for a second i didn't realize what he meant, but then i saw a fax 
lie beside the phone. i picked it up. the time on it was 9:08 p.m. 
and it was from somebody name john williams. then i remembered. wasn't 
that the fbi computer whiz he'd talk about the other day at the 
hospital, after we'd deconstructe sarah's waterlogged passport? 

there was no message, just a sheet with a date--two years old--and a 
list of name accompany by numbers and a capital letter. then i 
notice the letterhead of aviateca, the guatemala national airline, 
and it dawn on me i was look at a flight manifest. 

i scan down the page, and then i saw it. 

sarah crenshaw, 3b. 

williams found her, i thought. and she was travel first class. 

what caught my eye next was the name of the person sitting in 3a, the 
seat right next to hers. a. godford. probably a computer misprint. or 
maybe it was the name he use when he traveled. so if it was him, which 
it surely was, the bastard didn't even try to hide it. 

i just stood there, thinking. maybe you get one big-time coincidence in 
life, and if so, this must be mine. sarah and i had both found alex 
goddard. or he'd found us. other women came and went through quetzal 
manor, but we were different. she'd escape from him, half dead but now 
he'd sent ramo to bring her back. it was the one way he could be sure 
to keep me under his control. but again, why? was it just to stop my 
film, or was there more to the story? 

"morgy," lou groan "that son of a bitch took her tonight. i just know 
it." 

that was my conclusion precisely, though i hadn't been plan to say 
it to him, at least not yet. 

"how can you be so sure?" 

"something they said. i didn't quite catch it, but it sound like, 'he 
wants you back.' then some word. it sound like 'babylon' or 
something." 

i stare at him a second try to remember where i'd heard that 
before. then it click in. that was the last thing sarah had said 
she'd whisper that word when i was putt her to bed. what could she 
have been talk about? 

he wheeze and i went back to him and pressed the towel against his 
side. the bleeding was about stem but he was definitely due for a 
hospital stay. a siren was sound down the street. probably the 
ambulance. thank god i thought. now it's time to call the police. 

then i notice he was crying. what was that about? 

"morgy, they didn't actually kidnap her. you see, she--" 

"what?" i guess i was try to take it in. "what do you mean?" 

"know what she said? sarah?" he choke for a second, then continued. 
"she said, 'yes, i want to go back.' " 




chapter fourteen 


before i could ask him what the hell he was talk about, the medic 
were ring the doorbell. they strode in with a gurney, also rolling a 
portable plasma iv, young guy who look like they'd be more at home 
at a garden hockey game, follow immediately by two uniformed 
policemen, actually policewomen, one short and heavy, with reddish 
hair, the other a wiry young hispanic. (i found out that ambulance 
call out for stabbing or gunshot wound automatic get a cop 
escort.) in less than three minutes, lou was in the blue-and-white 
ambulance and on his way to st. vincent's emergency room. 

i rode in the backseat of the squad car as we follow them and try 
to explain what little i knew of what had happened. it turn out to be 
an education in the mindless stick points of the law. 

long story short: the fact that i hadn't report the burglary of my 
apartment that very same day immediately cast doubt on my serious 
as a truth-seeking citizen; i had no proof the unreported burglary of 
my apartment (if, indeed, such had actually occurred) was by some 
guatemala military attache name jose alvino ramos; since lou had 
never seen colonel ramo before tonight, he couldn't possibly identify 
him as that burglar either; accuse diplomat of a crime without 
ironclad proof was frown on downtown; and when i stupid repeated 
what lou had said about sarah's last words (well, he was go to tell 
them soon or later, it would just come bubble out at some point), 
the whole case that she was kidnap went into revision mode. 

by the time we got to the hospital, i was get question that seem 
to imply that maybe it was all a domestic affair--like most of their 
calls: some spaced-out chick who'd run away once and got brought back 
and then, still unstable and crazy, decided to knife her own dad and 
disappear again. now he was understand covering for her. happen 
more than you'd think. 

i kept stress that lou was former fbi and not the sort to invent 
such a whopper, but this was listen to in skeptical silence. if it 
was a kidnapping, they then wonder aloud what was the motive and 
where were the demand of the perpetrators? i was ready to start 
yell at them by the time we park in the seventh avenue driveway of 
the emergency room at st. vincent's. 

they next made me cool my heel in the wait room while they went 
back to interrogate lou. they were with him for almost an hour, then 
came back to where i was and ask me to read and sign the report 
they'd written. 

a trouble girl, who had emerge from a coma and apparently was 
suffering bout of non-rationality, had disappear and her father had 
been stab but not seriously. he was the only witness to the incident 
and claim she'd been kidnapped. however, the girl had run away once 
previously, and there was no physical evidence she'd been taken against 
her will; in fact, her father admitted she had declared just the 
opposite. the whole incident would be investigate further after he 
came downtown and made a complete statement. 

"i'm not go to sign this." i hand it back, fuming. 

"is there anything here that's not factual correct?" the 

hispanic cop was look me straight in the eye, her expression cold as 
alaska. 

the question made me seethe. sarah was probably already on her way out 
of the country, and here i was try to reason with two women who 
practically thought she was the criminal. but i knew a lost cause when 
i saw one. 

"forget about it. i want to see lou." 

an intern was coming out and i snag him, announce i was next of kin 
to a patient, and demand to be taken through the official door and 
into the back. at that moment, the stout cop's radio crackled. they 
were being summon to a christopher street gay bar where somebody had 
just been knife in a back room. she look at me, as though to say, 
"this sound like a real crime," and then they hurried out for their 
squad car. christ! 

the intern, a young black guy, led me past a row of gurney and into a 
private room at the rear of the huge space. lou was bandage all around 
his chest and hooked up to an iv and a monitor. he look better, but i 
wasn't sure he'd be ready for what i was about to tell him. 

"hey, how're you feeling?" i ask as i walk in, try to seem 
upbeat. 

"fucking cops." he was boiling, his face actually red. "where do they 
get them these days? mcdonald's rejects?" 

"easy, don't get your blood pressure up." i reach over and touched 
his brow. it felt like he had a mild temperature. "let's all just calm 
down and try to think rationally." 

"yeah, i'm thinking rationally. you saw that fax i got from williams." 

"you think that was alex goddard seat next to her, right?" 

"who else? when she was in her moonbeam phase, she must have heard 
about him and gone up there and end up in his clutches. but why did 
she let him take her down to--?" 

"he told me he has a clinic in central america. he call it 'a place 
of miracles.' and then colonel ramo show up, part of the guatemala 
diplomatic corps. put two and two together. that's got to be where 
they're taking her." 

"who knows, but i'm go to get the boys downtown to put out a 
missing-persons apb nationwide. gerry'll do it for me if i ask. fuck 
new york's finest. they ain't gonna do crap anyway." 

i listen wonder how to impress my bright idea upon him. the 
chance were ramo was taking sarah back to guatemala. probably right 
this minute. for some kind of unfinished business. or just to hold her 
there as an insurance policy that children of light would never be 
mention in my picture. 

"i seriously doubt a missing-persons alert is go to do any good lou, 
because i seriously doubt she's go to be walking the street of this 
country. that bastard ramo is taking her where he know he can hide 
her." 

"you mean . . . jesus." he stare at me as though the idea had never 
cross his mind. i think he'd just repressed it. "what are we go 
to--?" 

"the only thing we can do. i'm go down there. i'm go to go 
straight down there and locate alex goddard." 

"that's an exceptional lousy thought process." his voice seem to be 
coming from a great distance. 

"why? give me one good reason why. you think the police down there are 
go to bring charge against a colonel?" i really could have use 
some encouragement. "it's the only way--" 

"morgan, you've always been high-strung." he sigh and then winced. 
"ever since you were a kid. i worried about you then and i'm worried 
about you now. i don't want you to go down there and get into trouble. 
because believe me, that's a seriously wrong place to get crossway 
with the prick who make the rules. you don't know your way around that 
third world craphole. wouldn't be that hard to end up a statistic. we 
can alert the embassy. have them start look for her." 

"listen, there's a lot more go on between alex goddard and me than 
you know." this was definitely not the time to tell him about the 
babies, or about car and the threats. "trust me. i'm go down 
there. in the morning, if i can. who knows? sarah and ramo might even 
be on the same plane." 

as i was finish that pronouncement, two nurse came in rolling a 
gurney and announce that his room was ready. then they gave him a 
sedative. 

was i being irrational? the thing was, though, what would you do? i was 
absolutely sure ramo had taken her. so it was obvious that was where 
he would go next. he was a "diplomat," apparently, so he could easily 
fudge the passport formalities. 

as the nurse were helping lou onto the gurney, i stood there holding 
his hand and thinking about what lay ahead. steve was in belize and 
maybe not even reachable, but i decided to start by give him a call 
the minute i got home. 

then a middle-aged wasp, with dark hair, slightly balding, strode in 
the room. the photo id on his chest read "dr. m. summers." 

"so, how's the patient?" he enquire cheerily, ignore me as he 
immediately began check the chart at the foot of lou's bed. 

"felt better," lou said, not being taken in by his pro forma cheer. 

"well, we're go to make sure you get a good night's rest." dr. 
summer finished with the chart and start taking his pulse. "what's 
left of it." 

"how long am i go to be in here, doc?" lou asked, flinch as the 
nurse remove the iv stuck in his arm. 

"a couple of days. for observation. to make sure there're no 
complications." he smile again. "you're a lucky man, mr. . . . 
crenshaw. just a superficial cut. but we don't want you out play 
handball for a few days." he turn and gave me a conspiratorial wink, 
then glance back. "okay, up we go." 

"can i come with him?" i asked, not optimistic but hoping. 

the doctor look genuine contrite. "i'm really sorry, but he's go 
to be fine and visiting hour are long past. you can call in the 
morning. and you can come up anytime after two p.m. tomorrow. let's let 
him get some rest now." 

i walk around and took lou's hand, hot and fevered, feeling so 
agitated. 

"don't think about anything tonight, okay? worry won't help. just 
get some sleep. i'm go to find her, i promise you." 

"don't--" he mumble some words, but i think the sedative the nurse 
had given him was seriously start to kick 

"look, you can call down to 26 federal plaza tomorrow. see what they 
can do. in the meantime, let me follow my nose." 

he try to answer, but he was too far gone. i then watch wistful 
as he disappear down the sterile alley of beds. 

after i stop by the desk and help them fill out the insurance 
forms, i caught a cab downtown to retrieve my toyota. the time was now 
two-fifteen in the morning, but i still had plenty to do. when i got 
home, the first thing i did after i walk in the door was grab a phone 
book and call america airlines. they had a flight, in the morning at 
nine-thirty. i gave them my credit card specifics and made a 
reservation. 

i no long thought that alex goddard's children of light and its 
guatemala accomplice were merely do something shady. my hunch now 
was that it was completely illegal. they were get hundred of white 
baby in some way that couldn't bear the light of day, and they were 
prepared to do whatever it took to prevent me from highlight them in 
my film. and with the army involved, and now sarah taken, their game 
was beginning to feel more and more like kidnapping. they certainly 
knew how. 

sarah had become a pawn, and all because of me. i almost wonder if 
i'd been unconscious led to him by her, though that was impossible. 
whatever had happened, the remorse i now felt was overpowering. it was, 
in fact, an intensify version of the guilt that had dogged me for the 
past fifteen years, the horrible feeling i'd somehow let her down, not 
done enough for her. i could have flown back for her high school 
graduation, but i was cram for grad school final and didn't take 
the time. things like that, which, look back, seem terribly 
selfish. and now i'd brought this on her. god. 

okay, i thought, glancing at the clock, time to start making it up to 
her. screw up your courage and wake steve. 

the problem was, lou had been right about one thing. it'd been years 
since i'd been to guatemala, and i wasn't sure i knew bean about how 
things operate down there these days. i was high on motivation and 
only so-so in the area of modu operandi. i need steve's help in 
ply the tricky waters of that part of the planet. he was busy, but 
this was definitely "us against the world" time, so maybe he could 
drive over to guatemala city and help. 

i picked up the phone again and punch in the number of his hotel in 
belize city, which seem to be embed permanent in my brain. that 
wonderful accent at the desk mon, and then they were ring his room. 
i had no reason on earth to assume he would be there, but . . . 

the click, the voice, it was him. 

"sorry to call so late, love. you said you miss me, so i've decided 
to find out if it's true. your coming attraction is about to arrive." 

i guess i was try to keep it flip. after our talk that morning, i 
wasn't entire sure where we stood anymore. 

"who . . . morgy, is that you? god it's two . . . are you okay?" then 
he start coming around, process what i said. "you're coming . . . 
honey, that's great." 

as i noted before, he always knew how to give a good reading, sound 
sincere, no matter what the occasion. 

"actually, i've just made a plane reservation, and i'm go to be in 
guatemala city tomorrow, just after noon." i hesitate then thought, 
why beat around the bush? "care to meet me there?" 

"that's terrific," he declared coming fully awake. "but why don't you 
just come to belize city? can't you get flight? it's actually not 
nearly as wild here as the travel books--" 

"well, i've . . . look, i'd rather not talk about this on the phone. 
but do you think you could get free and drive over i really could use 
your help. i've got a situation." 

"well . . ." he paused. "i could be there by late tomorrow assume my 
rent jeep still operate after last week and the road haven't 
total disintegrated. where're you go to be staying?" 

"i don't know. got any suggestions? i want to keep out of the 
limelight." 

"then try the camino real. it's like a holiday inn with plastic palm 
trees. definitely low maintenance and low profile. hang on, i'll get 
you the number." 

which he did, though i could hear him stumble around the room in the 
dark. then he continued. 

"but listen, here's the bad news. i've got to be back here day after 
tomorrow. i just got a special permit to do some night shoot in the 
jaguar preserve down by victoria peak--you remember the rain forest i 
told you about?--but it's only good for one night, and i hear rumor 
there's an off-season hurricane form in the caribbean, which means 
i've got to stick to schedule. after that, though, i'm free again." 

"we'll work it out." i was thrill he would just drop everything and 
come. maybe we were over the rough spot about the baby. 

he didn't bring that up and i didn't either. instead we kill a few 
minutes, and then i let him go back to sleep. i want to say i love 
you, but i didn't want to push my luck. 

after that i call the hotel he'd recommended. the exchange was more 
spain than english, but they had a room. apparently lot of rooms. 

next i rang paula marks, even though it was terribly late. she must 
have had the phone off, but i left a message telling her to be 
careful, with a postscript that i'd explain everything later. just 
stick close to home. 

finally i call david's voice mail up at applecore. i told him i had a 
personal crisis and was go to guatemala city. i'd try to be back by 
the end of the week, hell or high water, but no guarantees. and if he 
touched so much as a frame of my work print while i was gone, i'd 
personally strangle him. 

i don't remember much of what happen next. i basically went on 
autopilot. it's as though i drop into a trance, total focused. i 
packed my passport, a good business suit, the tailor blue one, and 
also a set of mix-and-match separates, easy to roll and cram in. 
finally a couple of pair of good (clean) jeans, a few toiletries, and 
then, thinking ahead, i also threw in my yellow plastic flashlight. i 
almost always over pack, but not this time. 

oh, and one other thing. for airplane reading i grab a lonely planet 
guide to central america that steve had left behind--i guess he figured 
he was at the stage of life to start writing them, not reading 
them--that turn out to be very helpful, particularly the map of 
guatemala city and the northern peten rain forest. i then collapse 
and--images of sarah's emaciate face haunting my consciousness--caught 
a couple of hours' sleep. 

the next thing i knew, it was 9:20 a.m. and i was settle into window 
seat 29f on america airline flight 377--next to a two-hundred-pound 
executive busy rip articles out of the business section of _el 
diario_--headed for guatemala city. 




chapter fifteen 


for once in my life, i took my time get off an airplane. but the 
instant i felt that first burst of humid tropical air against my face, 
like a gush from a sauna, i found myself wonder what sarah had felt 
the moment her feet first touched the ground of guatemala. in fact, i'd 
decided to try to think like her, to better understand why she might 
want to come back. truthful i didn't have a clue. 

but first things first. not knowing whether i was being stalk by 
ramo or his proxies, i decided the idea was to see and not be 
seen--which actually was easy than i'd expected, at least during the 
initial pell-mell stages. turn out the self-centeredness of homo 
sapien blossom under those circumstances. ignore thy neighbor, go 
the credo. i just bury myself in the crush. 

when i got to "inmigracion," i labor through the "formalities" (as 
all country love to call the suspicious looks you get from their 
airport bureaucrats) along with all the other gringo passenger on aa 
flight 377, paranoid i might be arrest on the spot for some spurious 
reason. the purpose of my visit, i declared, was tourism. just a nod at 
my passport and a stamp, which look exactly like the one in sarah's. 
i stare at it and felt a renew sense of purpose. in fact, the photo 
in my passport look more than a little like her. maybe, i thought, 
i'm get carry away with the identity issue, but there it was. 

as i emerge through the wide glass door of the arrival area, which 
front out onto the steps leading down to the parking lot and the 
humidity, i spotted a black land rover with tint window right in 
front. uh-oh. that was, steve once told me, a vehicle much favored by 
the notorious guatemala g-2 military secret police, who had retired 
the cup for murderous human-rights abuse over the past two decades. 

then two middle-aged men with latin mustache and nondescript brown 
shirt began get out through the door on the far side. they next 
walk around to the terminal side of the car and glance up the steps 
in my direction, as though look for somebody. it was a quick survey, 
after which they turn back and nod to the vehicle before it sped 
away. 

what's that about? am i imagine things already? 

by the time i reach the bottom of the steps, i was being besiege by 
clamor cabbies, so it was difficult to keep an eye on the two men, 
who were now walking off to the side of the main commotion, toward a 
shady grove of palm at the end of the arrival drive, lighting 
cigarettes. 

get out of here. whether you're fantasize or not, the thing to do is 
grab an unsuspect cab and get going. 

i stroll toward the other end of the long row of concrete steps till 
i reach an area where cab were parked, more driver lurk in wait. 
they all look the same way most cabbie in third world lands look: 
shabby clothes, with beat-up cars, an expression in their eyes 
somewhere between aggression and desperation. 

just pick one whose car looks like it might actually make it to 
downtown. 

i spotted a dark blue chevy that seem clean and well maintained, its 
driver young and full of male hormone as he beckon me to his 
vehicle, all the while undress me with his eyes. yep, he was 
definitely my guy. 

i amble by his car, acting as though i was ignore the innuendo of 
his pitch. then i bolt for the back door, open it myself since he 
was too startle to help, threw in my carry-ons, pile in behind them, 
and yelled, "let's go. rapido." 

as we sped away, i realize his greatest surprise was that i hadn't 
raise the subject of price. at that point, it was the last thing on my 
mind. i look back to see the two guy from the black land rover, 
together with two others, heading for a car that had been double-parked 
right in front. 

had i been right after all? 

we made a high-speed turn onto the highway, and i immediately ordered 
the driver to take a service road that led off toward a cluster of gas 
station and parking lot with falling-down barbed-wire fences. i 
figured i had about half a minute of lead time, whatever was go on. 

we dodge massive pothole and the loose gravel flew, but then we 
reach a ramshackle gas station and i ordered him to pull in. then i 
watch the line of traffic speeding by on the main highway for several 
minutes. nobody pull off. good. 

my driver finally got around to ask where i want to go, and as 
calm as i could, i told him. 

"the palacio nacional." 

"_si_." 

with that he gun his engine and spun out. jesus! 

"_mas despacio, por favor_." 

"okay," he said, showing off his english as he don his sunglasses. 
"i go more slow. no problem." 

the initial destination was part of my new plan, hatch while i was on 
the plane. when i was reading my guidebook and filling out my entry 
card i'd had a bright idea. i knew exactly how i want to begin. 

heading into town, the time now the middle of the afternoon, i lean 
back in the seat and try to absorb the view, to get a feeling for 
where i was. we first traveled through the suburban fringes, the 
heavy guarded luxurious mansions of the landhold and military 
elite, the one percent of guatemala who own ninety-nine percent of the 
country. iron fence and wide expanse of lawn, protect by uzi-toting 
security, guarded whimsical architecture conceit top by silver 
satellite dishes. a twenty-foot wall shield their delicate eyes from 
the city's largest shanty-town, makeshift hovel of bamboo and rust 
tin, with no sign of water or drain or toilets. guatemala city: as 
steve had put it once, a million doom citizens, the rich and the 
poor, trap together side by side in the most "modern" capital in 
central america. 

why on earth had sarah decided to come here? even if she did travel 
with the mesmerize alex goddard it was hard to imagine a place less 
spiritual. couldn't she feel that this was all wrong? one of us had to 
be missing something major. 

fifteen minutes later i was passing through the fetid atmosphere of 
downtown, which seem to be another world, guatemala city's twin soul. 
it was an urban hodgepodge of burg king, mcdonald's, discount 
electronics emporia, an eye-numbing profusion of plastic signs, filthy 
parking lots, rattletrap bus and taxis, stall traffic. exhaust 
fumes thicken the air, and everywhere you look teenage "guards" in 
uniform loiter in front of stores and bank with sawed-off shotguns, 
boys so green and scared-looking you'd think twice about letting one of 
them park your car. but there they were, weapon at the ready, 
nervous monitor passersby. who were they defend all the wealth 
from? the ragged street children, with swollen belly and skin 
disease, vend single cigarette from open packs? or the horde of 
widow and orphans, beneficiary of the army's mayan "pacification" 
program, who now beg for centavo or plaintive hawk half-rotten 
fruit from the safety of the shadows? 

my bright-idea destination was a government office in the palacio 
nacional, right in the center of town, where i hope i could find 
sarah's old landing card, the record of when tourist arrive and 
departed. when i'd fill mine out on the plane, i'd realize you were 
supposed to put down where you'd be stay in guatemala. i figured the 
best way to locate her this time was to find out where she went last 
time. . . . 

as my cab pull up in front, a black land rover was park in a 
"prohibido estacionarse" zone by the front steps. to my eyes it look 
like the same one i'd seen at the airport. shit. 

but nobody was around, so i decided maybe i was just being paranoid 
again. 

the palacio turn out to be a mixture of moorish and faux greece 
architecture, with a facade of light green imitation stone that gave 
off the impression of a large, rococo wedding cake. i took a long look, 
paid off the driver--who had turn out to be very nice--and head in. 
it was, after all, a public building, open to tourist gringos. 

nobody in the lobby appear to take any particular notice of me, so 
after go through their very serious security, uniform and gun 
everywhere, i checked the directory. 

it turn out the president, cabinet ministers, and high military 
officer all kept offices there, but it didn't take long to find the 
bureau i was look for. go down the marble-floored hallway on the 
third floor, i pass by the sala de recepcion, a vast wood-paneled 
room of enormous chandeliers, stained-glass windows, and a massive coat 
of arms. quite a place, but not my destination. at the far end of the 
hallway, i found the door i wanted, went in, and try out the spain 
question i'd been practice in the cab. not necessary: english work 
fine. 

"_senora_, the record for that time were only kept on paper," a ladino 
woman declared shrugging, her nail colored a brash mauve, her hair a 
burst of red, "but you are welcome to look." she'd been on the phone, 
chat in rapid-fire spanish, but she quick hung up and got out her 
glasses. 

"thanks." 

the welcome mat was obviously a little thin. the woman was try to be 
friendly, but very quick her nervous began to come through. 
"we're always glad to accommodate america searching for friends or 
relatives," she went on, attempt a smile. "some of your america 
press has been printing distortions, that the guatemala army conspire 
with the cia to cover up murders. it's a total lie." 

right. maybe you ought to see some of the photo steve has of the 
"army-pacified" maya village up in the mountains. 

the search took an hour and a half of leaf through dusty boxes, 
which chafe my hand raw, but then . . . voila. 

there it was. the crucial piece of information lou had missed. a 
hasty scribbled-in landing card for an american, with the name sarah 
crenshaw. i stare at it a moment, feeling a glow of success. was it an 
omen? 

it was definitely her. she'd even dot an "i" with a smiley face, one 
of her personal trademarks. 

then i look down the form. what i want was the address she'd put 
down as a destination in guatemala. 

the answer: "ninos del mundo, peten department." 

my hope sank. great. that was like saying your address 

is children of the world, lost somewhere in the state of montana. 

the home address was equally vague. just "new york." so much for the 
high level of curiosity at "inmigracion." 

however, the carbon copy of the landing card, which you're supposed to 
surrender when you leave, was not staple to it, the way it was on all 
the other in the box. naturally, since she'd left in a medevac plane, 
half dead. 

"what do this mean?" i got up and walk over to the woman's desk, 
carry the card. mainly i just want to get a rise out of her. "the 
carbon copy is missing. do that mean she could still be here?" 

red alert. she glance at the arrival date a moment and her eyes froze. 
then, doubtless with vision of another cia scandal loom in her 
consciousness, she brusque announce that the office was get 
ready to close for the day. 

"you'll have to pursue any further inquiry through the america 
embassy, mrs. james, which handle all matter concerning u.s. 
nationals." 

"well, thanks for all your help." i was finally get the 
police-state runaround i'd expect all along. i guess i need her to 
care, and it was obvious she didn't. 

okay . . . i'd plan to go to the embassy anyway. maybe they could 
tell me about this place she'd put on her landing card. could it be the 
local name for alex goddard's clinic? 

as i picked up my things, i thought again about the prospect of showing 
my face on the street of guatemala city. would there be more loiter 
men in grungy brown shirt wait to watch my every move? more black 
land rovers? as i march back out through the ornate lobby, i decided 
not to let my imagination get too active. it was now late afternoon, 
but i was making progress. i also was thinking about steve, wonder 
if he'd gotten into town yet. probably not for another couple of hours, 
but just thinking about seeing him again, and have him for support, 
was boost my energy. 

a short cab ride later i arrive at the embassy of the all-powerful 
united states of america, a two-block-long concrete fortress on reforma 
avenue guarded by yank marine with heavy automatic weapons. when i 
explain myself to the pr people man the reception desk, including 
my brush with guatemala bureaucracy, they told me to check with the 
internal security section. 

"in fact, if you're look for an america national, this is where you 
should have come in the first place," said a very efficient-appearing 
young woman, with a business suit and dark, close-cropped hair. "a 
phone call from here works wonders at the palacio nacional." 

i had no proof sarah was in guatemala yet, and if she was, it would 
doubtless be under a different name. what's more, telling them my 
suspicion that she'd been kidnap by a high official and brought here 
would definitely brand me as a conspiracy theorist. so for now, all i 
could really hope to get from them was an address for alex goddard's 
clinic, someplace to start. where and what was "ninos del mundo"? 
apparently the woman hadn't fully understood that. 

moments later a thirtyish male attache show up, look very harried. 
he also could have been president of the local young republicans, with 
a cute haircut and preppie tie, knot perfectly. 

"hi, i'm mel olberg. how can i . . .?" 

i told him i want to see someone who was responsible for the record 
of missing america tourists. i also sense he was edgy and try to 
get it over with fast; all the while he kept check his watch, only 
half listening. 

"gee, i really wish you'd come earlier," he said. "monday 

afternoons are a little nuts around here, weekly report due and all, 
and it's get late." when he glance at his watch again, making sure 
i noticed, i found myself wanting to yell at the guy. "i mean it's been 
two years since this woman you're look for fill out a landing 
card. we might have something in the files, but. . . would it be 
possible for you to come back tomorrow?" 

"no, it will not be possible," i lied. "i've got a plane back to new 
york tomorrow." i felt my frustration rising. i want to just grab him 
and shake him. 

my first thought was to tell him i make documentary film and maybe 
he'd like to end up in one about how my country's guatemala city 
embassy didn't care about its citizens. but then i decided to go in a 
different, probably more productive, direction. 

"just for five minutes," i declared, reach for feign helplessness. 

"well, let me call upstairs," he muttered, realizing, i suppose, that 
the best way to get rid of me was to kick me up the chain of command, 
"and see if mr. morton can take a moment to meet with you." 

it worked. the next thing i knew, i was in the office of a good-looking 
diplomat name barry morton--gray temples, tailor suit, rugged face 
of a sixty-year-old soap-opera heartthrob who play tennis and keeps a 
mistress. chief information officer. 

"actually, i do remember her, vaguely," morton declared, flash me 
his professional smile. "the crenshaw girl was an unfortunate case. to 
begin with, anybody who overstay their visa that long get us in a lot 
of hot water with the locals. they always tend to blame us, ms. . . ." 

"james. my name's morgan james." 

"ms. james." another of those smiles. "frankly, i don't know what to 
tell you, though." he shrugged, exude helplessness. "it's hard to 
keep track of every america tourist who come and go through this 
country. some of the hippie type end up in a mountain village 
somewhere, gone native. in this instance, as i recall, we got her out 
on a medevac." 

"her landing card gave her destination as someplace call 'ninos del 
mundo,' up to the peten. that ring a bell? any idea how i could find 
it?" 

"niiios del mundo?" he glance up quickly. "that's a new one on me." 
he'd been fiddling with a stack of papers on his desk, give me only 
half his attention, but he abrupt stopped. "you try the phone book?" 

"like i said, it's in the peten." i was get the definite sense he 
want to get rid of me as soon as possible. the whole scene was 
feeling tense and off. "my understanding is that's mostly rain forest. 
do they even have phone up there?" 

"not many," he said, his tone start to definitely acquire an "i have 
better things to do" edge. 

that was when he focus in on me, his look turning protective. 

"let me speak candidly, ms. james, strict off the record. down here 
people have been known to 'disappear' just for ask too many 
questions. curiosity kill the cat, and all that. between us, this 
place is still a police state in many regards. you want my advice, let 
sleep dogs lie. just forget about this crenshaw girl. she's out of 
the country now, so . . . let me put it like this: people who go poke 
around here are just ask for trouble." 

i felt a ring of sincerity in his voice. maybe a little too much 
sincerity. why was he so worried for me? 

"that may be true, but i'm still go to see what i can find out. my 
heart is pure. why should anybody care?" 

"do what you think best," he said with a sigh, "but i've told you 
everything we know. which, i'm afraid, is actually very little." 

"by the way." try one more thing on him, i thought, see what he'll say. 
"since you're so concerned about sarah, you'll be relieved to know 
she's regain consciousness and start to talk." there seem no 
point in telling him any more. the rest was all still speculation. 

that stop him cold. "what . . . what has she said?" his eyes 
appear startle in the glaring light of the office fluorescents. at 
long last i had his undivided attention. 

"you're busy." i smile at him. "i don't want to bore you with details. 
but it's just go to be a matter of time before she remember exactly 
what happen down here." 

"she hasn't talk about it yet?" he was fiddling with an ornate letter 
opener, an onyx jaguar head on the handle. 

"she's get there." i stare back at him, try to read his mood. 
"we may soon find out who was behind whatever happen to her." then i 
try a long shot. "maybe officialdom here had something to do with it." 

"let me tell you something." he sigh again, seeming to regain his 
composure. "the sovereign state of guatemala definitely play by its 
own rules. whenever foreigner down here meet with foul play, 
lower-level official have develop a consensus over the years that 
sometimes it's better not be too industrious. nobody's ever sure of 
what, or who, they might turn up." 

the meeting was definitely ending, and once again i had more question 
than answers. something about barry morton felt wrong, but i couldn't 
quite get a grip on what it was. one thing i was certain of: he knew 
more than he was telling me. why was that? 

as i was exit through his outer office, head for the swarm 
street below, i wave good-bye to his secretary, a stout, fiftyish 
ladino matron with defiant black-dyed hair, a hard look mitigate 
somewhat by the zircon trim on her thick glasses and a small silver 
pendant nestle on her ample, low-cut sweater. it was the pendant that 
caught my eye, being the silver face of a cat, most likely the local 
jaguar. look just like the one i'd seen you-know-where. i was 
staring so hard i almost stumble over a chair. yes. it was definitely 
like those i remember from kevin and rachel. 

the only difference was, when she bent over to reach for her stapler, 
the medallion twist around and the back, i could see, flash blank 
silver, no engraving of lines and dots. 

so where did she get it? i start to ask her, but decided i'd just get 
more bs runaround. then i had another thought: maybe she handle a lot 
of things that never made it to barry morton's desk, the "don't waste 
the boss's valuable time" kind of secretary. maybe she s the one i 
really should have been talk to, the kind of woman who take care of 
everything while the high-paid senior supervise is at long lunches. 

she look at me, and our eyes met and held for a second. had she been 
listen in on my chat with morton? did she know something i ought to 
know? 

by then, however, thought of steve were weigh in. i hadn't seen him 
in three and a half month and i was realize that was about my limit. 
i want to recapture the lost time. our being together was go to 
make everything turn out right. 

clinging to that thought, i grab a cab and head for my hotel and a 
much-overdue hot bath. 




chapter sixteen 


"come here," he said. 

whoosh. there he was. he strode through the door, tan safari shirt, 
smell like a man who'd just driven hundred of mile through central 
america in an open jeep. i want to undress him with my teeth and lick 
off the sweat. brown eyes, skin tan as leather, he threw his arms 
around me and i felt the weight of the world slip away. he was here. i 
was wearing a robe, fresh from the tub, but it was gone in a second. 
steve, i gotta say, knew a thing or two about the bedroom. 

as we wound ourselves together for the next two hours, i had a 
refresher course in how much id miss him, soul and body. his taste, 
his skin, his touch. finally, we were both so exhaust we just lay 
there bath in sweat, spoon together on the sag bed. i hadn't 
felt so good in years. it was like another world. 

"god i've miss you," i said again, holding him closer. the 
air-conditioning was beginning to lose ground against the late sun, but 
i didn't care. after my solo nightmare of the last two days, i was 
remember what it was like to be a couple again. 

the camino real, by the way, turn out to be an american-style 
hideaway with budget shag carpeting and flake blue walls. in a way, 
though, the downtrodden decor actually made it more romantic, like we'd 
sneak off to a garish hot-sheet motel for a twilight rendezvous. 

i finally drag myself up and got us a bottle of water. then, leaning 
against the rickety headboard, i recount an abbreviate version of 
what had happen yesterday after we'd first talked--the theft of my 
film, and then lou being assault and sarah taken, apparently 
willingly, to be brought (i strong suspected) back here. what i held 
out on were the detail about a certain colonel jose alvino ramos, my 
belief that he was behind the crime and in league with alex goddard 
and stalk me. i was afraid our room was bugged. 

"morgy, we'll get through this," he said, reach over to stroke my 
hair. "if somebody brought her back down here, we'll find her. and i 
apologize for being such a shit on the phone, about the baby. i'd just 
had a local lab lose three rolls of high-speed kodachrome and i was 
seriously frost at the world. we can keep try if you want to." 

"just hold me." i put down my glass and i reach around and ran my 
finger across his chest. it was so lovely to be this close to somebody 
you want so much. i love his earnest brown eyes and his soft skin. i 
love him. just have him with me made such a difference. 

the unexpected part was, i'd ask him to come and help me, but now 
that he was here, i was start to feel uneasy about lure him into 
my personal nightmare. was that really fair? 

also, i was get hint he had problem of his own. the photo book, i 
gathered, was not coming together the way he'd hoped. he'd mumble 
something about finding himself torn between a heartstrings essay about 
the children (his specialty; you've probably seen his work, whether you 
know it or not), a devastating portrayal of the latest crop of sleazy 
politicos, or a nature valentine to the vanish rain forest. but 
whenever he agonized about his work, i knew enough to keep my mouth 
shut and just listen. he didn't want bright ideas; he just want me to 
clam up and be there for him. 

anyway, i knew he'd think his way through the problem. he had a 
deceptive air of vulnerable that always disappear in a crunch. he 
was the master of ad hoc solutions. . . . 

at that moment, he reach for his watch, studied it, and abrupt 
bolt straight up. "hey, i almost forgot my surprise. i hope you're 
still up for it. did you know this is our anniversary? it was on this 
very day i first watch you dive into that grungy swimming pool at the 
oloffson in port-au-prince." 

"my god you're right. i'm humiliated." i hug him contritely, feeling 
like a self-centered twit. i guess i was too focus on sarah. (i screw 
up a lot on birthday too, always with an excuse.) "i don't even have a 
present for you. i've been so--" 

"that's okay." he grin then stood up and head for the shower. "not 
the first time. but i've got one for both of us. we'll make it a gift 
to each other. it'll help start you thinking like a _guatemalteco_ 
insider." 

"what? you sneak. what did you get?" 

"a trip back into the void of prehistoric time," he yell over his 
shoulder. "i am the possessor of a little-known secret about this town. 
i call from belize city this morning and made dinner reservation for 
us downtown. you'll see." 

god i love this man. but the last thing on my mind at that moment was 
food. 

"honey, i don't know if i'm really--" 

"hey, don't wimp out on me. if we're go to do this place, at least 
we can do it in style. besides, you can't live on smog alone. you gotta 
eat." 

he had a point. starve myself wasn't go to help find sarah any 
sooner. and there were detail i want to tell him that i didn't want 
to broadcast in the room. what if colonel ramo had long ear to match 
his long arm? 

"come on," he pressed. "just put on the slinkiest thing 

you've got and get ready to go native. it'll help you put this part of 
the world into perspective." 

alas, i had nothing particularly "slinky," though fortunately i'd 
packed a silk blouse i could loosen and tie with a scarf around the 
waist. don't laugh, it worked. i even brush on some serious eye 
shadow, which normally i don't bother with much. 

i try not to let him know how concerned i was as we walk down the 
driveway of the hotel and hail a cab, while i furtive search the 
shadows. seeing the street after dark made me sad all over again for 
sarah. i still want to see and feel guatemala the way she had, but 
when i got close to the reality of the place, it made me uneasy. 

it turn out the marvel he'd discover was call siriaco's, a 
wonderful old place with a patio and garden in back--both roof by 
glittering tropical stars--which were down a stone pathway from the 
main dine room and bar. it appear to be where a lot of vips, the 
ruling oligarchy, dined. it was romantic and perfect. 

when we arrived, his special anniversary surprise was already being 
laid out on a low stone table, attend by mayan women all in 
traditional dress: the colorful _huipil _blouses of their villages, red 
and blue skirts, immense jade earrings. 

"they've reconstruct a kingly feast from old documents," he 
explained, beam at my amazement. "cuisine of the ancient rain 
forest. we're go to have a banquet of authentic _guatemalteco_ chow 
from eon ago." 

and the meal was definitely fit for royalty. soon we were working our 
way through a long-forgotten medley of piquant flavor that swept 
through my senses as though i were in another world. there was 
pit-roasted deer, steam fish, bake wild turkey. one calabash bowl 
set forth coriander-flavored kidney beans; another had half a dozen 
variety of green legume all in a rich turtle broth; a third offer 
vanilla-seasoned sweet potatoes; other had various forest tuber 
steam with chiles. we even had a delicious honey wine, like heavenly 
nectar, serve in red clay bowls, that made me want to have sex right 
on the table. there with steve, the unexpected juxtaposition of spice 
and flavor made every bite, every aroma, a new sensual experience. 
(let me say right here he's a cooking fanatic, whereas i've been known 
to burn water. i think it's the new division of labor in post-feminist 
america.) finally the mayan waitresse brought out cup of a chocolate 
dessert drink from ancient times, cocoa bean roasted, ground, and 
boil with sugarcane. the whole event was pure heaven. 

except for the occasional unwanted intrusions. various dark-eyed 
low-cut ladino divorcees, about half a dozen in all, hanging out at the 
bar with heavy perfume and too much jewelry, kept coming over 
purported to marvel over our private feast (or was it steve's big 
brown eyes). he return their attention with his polite and perfect 
spanish, but i despise them. in any case, they were shameless. not 
remember quite enough espanol, however, the best i could do was just 
to put my hand on his and give them the evil eye. it seem to work, 
though what i really want to do was hold up a cross the way you do to 
ward off vampires. . . . 

"hey, check out orion," he said finally leaning back, an easy, 
delicious finger aim at that sprawl constellation. i look up at 
the canopy of stars, and sure enough, the hunter and his sword 
dominate the starry sky above like a stalwart centurion, guard us. 
"i always know i'm in the tropics when it's right overhead." 

"honey, this has been wonderful," i declared. "thank you so much." i 
move around and kiss him. "it's exactly the attitude adjust i 
needed." 

"well"--he smile back--"now i guess we've got some 

organize to do. so tell me everything you left out back there at the 
hotel. i know you were holding off." 

i was feeling increasingly hyper, probably from the high-octane 
chocolate, but i proceed to recount all my finding about alex 
goddard and quetzal manor. then i move on to colonel ramo and how 
he'd threaten car and me about my film. finally, i told him my deep 
belief that colonel ramo and a couple of his goon were obviously the 
one who'd rough up lou and taken sarah. 

"bad scene," he said when i finally pause for breath. he was toy 
with his cup and running his finger through his sandy hair, in that 
"deep thought" mode of his. "way i see it, this just sound like a 
classic case of sell kids. to me, that's right up there with murder 
and grand larceny." 

"well, i also firm believe it's all tie in with alex goddard's 
clinic here, or whatever it is. the place sarah call nino del mundo 
on her landing card. i'll bet you anything that's where ramo has taken 
her." 

"you know," he said, his brow a perfect furrow, eyes narrowed, "about 
the baby you saw, there've been press story over the last few years 
about america being attack in guatemala on suspicion of try to 
kidnap maya children out in the villages, to put up for adoption. but 
i've never seen any proof of it. i've always thought it just might have 
been dumb gringo who don't know the culture. they go poke around out 
in the countryside and stupid say the wrong thing. maybe use 
schoolbook spain nobody out there really understands. but now this 
make me wonder if--" 

"love, those baby i saw up at quetzal manor are not kidnap indian 
children, trust me. they're caucasian as vanilla snow cones. try again." 

"i get your point," he said quickly. "but let me relate the fact of 
life down here. when you've got some guatemala colonel behind 
something, you'd better think twice about how many rocks you turn over." 

"funny, but that's exactly what some guy at the embassy name barry 
morton said to me." 

"and you'd better listen. this is the country that turn the word 
'disappear' into a new kind of verb. people get 'disappeared.' i 
actually knew some of them, back in the late eighties. one dark night 
an army truck rolls into a village, and when the torture and . . . 
other things are over with, a few maya are never heard from again." he 
look at me. "you saw my pictures of that village in the huehuetenango 
department, tzalala, where the army mutilate and murder half the--" 

"i know all about that." it was chill to recall his gruesome photos. 
"but i'm go to track down alex goddard's clinic, no matter what. 
that's where they've taken sarah, i'm sure of it. i just may need some 
help finding it." 

he grimaced. "damn, i've got to head back to belize by noon tomorrow." 
then his look brightened. "but, hey, i finish my shoot wednesday, so i 
can drive back here on thursday. then on friday maybe we could--" 

"come on, love, i can't just sit around till the end of the week. what 
am i go to do till then?" the very thought made me itchy. "i need to 
find out if nino del mundo, the place sarah put on her original 
landing card is for real. her card said it's somewhere in the peten, 
the rain forest. if i could find somebody who--" 

"okay, look." he was thinking aloud. "how about this? there's a guy 
here in town who owe me a favor. a big one. he screw me out of 
twenty grand in the u.s. we were go to start a travel magazine--i 
think i told you about that--but then he took my money and split the 
country. he end up down here and went to work for the cia--till they 
sack him. after that he lease a helicopter and start some kind of 
bullshit tourist hustle. he sure as hell know what's go on. name's 
alan dupre. the prick. maybe i could give him a call and we could get 
together for a late drink. he's got an easy number these days: 4-mayan." 

"how's he go to help?" 

"trust me. he's our guy." 

i lean back and closed my eyes, my imagination drifting. in that 
brief moment, my mind float back to yesterday afternoon at lou's 
loft, and sarah. her hallucination still haunt me. what had happen 
to her in the rain forest? and why would she say she want to go back? 

then i snap back. "all right. try and ring him if you think he can 
help. right now i need all i can get." 

he got up and work his way to the phone, past the crowded bar, while 
i try to contemplate the night sky. i look up again, hope to see 
orion, but now a dark cloud had move in, leave nothing but deepen 
blackness. he'd said there was a storm brewing, part of an 
out-of-season hurricane develop in the caribbean, so i guess this 
was the first harbinger. 

"tonight's out, but tomorrow's okay." he was stride back. "crack of 
dawn. which for him is roughly about noon. we'll have a quick 
get-together and then i've got to run. really. but if this guy doesn't 
know what's go on down here, nobody does. he's probably laid half 
those hot tomatillo there at the bar. the man has his sources, if you 
get my meaning." 

"then let's go back to the glorious camino real." i took his hand. 
"we'll split the check. at the moment, even that seem romantic." 

"i'm still thinking about--" 

"don't. don't think." i touched his lips, soft and moist, then kiss 
him. an impulsive but deep felt act. "we've all had enough thinking 
for one day." 




chapter seventeen 


alan dupre didn't ring till almost ten-thirty the next morning, and i 
had the feeling even that was a stretch. he then offer to meet us in 
the parque concordia, right downtown. as i watch him amble toward 
our bench, my first impression was: why'd we bother? 

the man appear to be in his early forties, puffy-eyed and 
pink-cheeked with discount aviator shades, look like a glad-handing 
tourist just down to central america for a weekend of unchaperoned 
bacchanals. the flowered sport shirt, worn outside the belt, gave him 
the aura of a tout insufficient attire without a can of coors in 
hand. 

how can this be progress? i'm down here hope to find sarah, and i end 
up in a trash-filled park meeting some expat operator. 

steve had explain that the main benefit of alan dupre's cia gig was 
that he did learn how to fly a helicopter. with that skill he'd end 
up start a tourist agency in guatemala city use an old bell he 
leased: "mayan pyramid from the air." mainly, though, he was a 
self-styled bon vivant who knew people. 

"steve the brave." on came dupre's mirthless smile as he approach a 
jaunty spring enter his step. 

"alan, any friend of yours has got to be brave." steve just stare at 
him. 

dupre had the kind of empty grin that look like it'd been rehearse 
in his high school bathroom mirror. it was thin, kind of forked and 
dangerous, and this morning its plaster quality undermine any attempt 
at honesty. maybe dealing with complain tourist every day of your 
life did that to you. 

"you called, i came." he was now shift from foot to foot. "guess it 
finally had to happen. what's the phrase? you can run but you can't 
hide? surprise us both and pretend you're happy to see me." 

steve look like he was not entire prepared for this moment. he use 
the awkward pause that follow to introduce me. dupre shook hand like 
he was fearful of germs, then turn back. 

"jesus, man, i'm still working on the money, honest to god. but do i 
get a last cigarette before the fire squad?" 

"hey, alan, ease up." steve was deadpan. "good to see you again. i mean 
it. love that waikiki shirt, by the way. never knew you had such 
progressive taste." 

"this is actually my incognito attire. for secret missions. it's my 
objective today to look like some cruise-ship jerk." he glance around 
nervously. "so how'm i doing?" 

"i'd say your years of training in undercover work have paid off." 

i listened, remember steve had explain that alan dupre's career as 
a cia information-gatherer was hamper by his propensity to drink too 
much tequila and then brag about his occupation, hope to impress 
whatever woman he had in his sight at the moment. 

"so bring me up to date." steve was try to hide his total contempt. 
"why'd you get out of the spook business? langley couldn't find a 'new 
mission' for you after the evil empire dissolved?" 

dupre's face turn pensive. "man, you don't get it, do you? langley's 
still got plenty on its mind. nothing has changed. most people don't 
realize the u.s. isn't run by the folks they vote for. there's a 
permanent government that doesn't appear on larry king, and i was part 
of it. the central intelligence agency of the u.s. of a. will go on 
do exactly what it's always done, guide event in third world 
toilet like this through whatever means are necessary to protect 
america's strategic concerns. keeping the world safe for microsoft and 
ronald mcdonald." he pause and glance at me, as though slightly 
embarrassed. then he continued. "what i'm saying is, all those beltway 
turkey with the briar pipes and gigabyte computers, sitting around 
wring their hands, worried the company needs a new mission, never 
really grasp its old mission." 

"you're right," steve said go along with the shtick, the applause 
lines dupre had doubtless use in a thousand bars. "i'm get slow. 
what langley needs nowadays is a new cover story." 

"couldn't have phrase it better." dupre smile again too easily. 
"they're--" 

"actually," steve said cutting him off impatiently, all the while 
gaze up at the gathering dark cloud as though they were a hover 
adversary, "the truth of the matter is, we call you to discuss a 
favor. a small helping hand." he seem to be searching for a sales 
point. "for old times' sake." 

"for old times' sake?" dupre appear to be have trouble with the 
concept. 

"yeah. all we want is to hear a little talk of the town." he gaze out 
over the square, uzi-toting police still strolling by. "you know, local 
information of the kind that doesn't make the papers." 

"right," i said. "for starters, how could a gringa sort of melt into 
the peten rain forest, disappear for month and months, and then end up 
in a coma?" i'd decided to feel him out before go for the big 
questions. 

"people disappear down here all the time, and nobody in their right 
mind go around inquiring why." dupre seem genuine astonish that 
anyone would find such a thing unusual. he also was fingering a 
cigarette pack in his breast pocket, clearly nervous about the quick 
turn our conversation had taken. "whatever's your problem in guatemala, 
just forget about it. drink some _cerveza_, take a few snapshot of the 
picturesque natives, and then move on to a civilize place. this is a 
land of mystery, lady, and the people who matter like it that way. 
there are those here who take their privacy very seriously." 

just like alex goddard's children of light, i thought. or nino del 
mundo, or whatever it's called. it was chill to hear alan dupre 
backing away so quick from my question. the guy seem truly scared 
under all the bluster. i also observe that his eyes were curious 
small, out of proportion to his face. i hadn't notice it at first. 

"well," i went on, determined to push him, "an old landing card for the 
person i'm look for said her destination was a place call nino 
del mundo, up in the peten. i assume that's somewhere in the northern 
rain forest, right? so i guess what i want to know is, do that name 
stir up any connections?" 

he look around, then extract a gauloise from a blue pack and lit it 
with a wooden match, flick the tip with his fingernail. he inhaled, 
taking his time. "well, maybe i've heard a little something about a 
place some people call by that name." he drew again on the cigarette. 
"and the story might include a female america _tourista_ or two--about 
one a year, actually--who've sort of melt into the forest never to be 
seen more. i'm not exactly sure where it is, though. or even if what 
you hear is true. but who cares? come on, guys, this is guatemala, for 
chrissake. shit happens. get a life." 

"the embassy, or the cia, or anybody ever carry out an inquiry?" i felt 
my energy rising. "a woman every year or so? i went by reforma avenue 
yesterday and nobody there seem to have ever heard of any of this." 

"no kidding." he snorted. "whatever happen that place, our care 
embassy, ain't gonna do zip--don't faint at the news--and there's no 
way the company's go to pull their old-time yankee number, roll in 
with the beige sunglasses, and yell, 'okay, you peons, we're here to 
take name and kick butt. what happen to our national?' they've 
recently acquire a habit of taking local situation at face value. 
make for a lot better table at the tony supper club in town." 

this guy like to talk, i realize but he had no interest in go 
beyond glib one-liners. i glance at steve, and i could tell he was 
have the same thoughts. 

"tell you what," steve said finally, "how about this? tell us whatever 
you know about how to find this place, and maybe we can adjust the 
terms on the money you screw me out of. i might settle for something 
less on the dollar and let bygones be bygones." 

"hey, man, you'll get your money. i'm good for it." dupre sigh and 
drew on his gauloise. "it's just that things are a little tight right 
now, you know." he paused. "matter of fact, i was hope you might be 
able to spare a couple of bill for a week or so. but i guess . . ." 
his voice trail off. 

alan dupre knew something i need to know, or might know it. steve had 
definitely found the right guy in that regard. but he clearly was 
cautious to the point of paralysis as he kept furtive glancing 
around. what was he so fearful of, and what could i do to convince him 
to help me? 

i stood gaze at the dark sky for a long moment, and 

then i had an off-the-wall idea, a long shot, the all-or-nothing take 
you go for when the sun is die and the union are look at overtime. 

"you do tourist flights, right?" i started, still working on the idea. 
"so how about pretend i'm an eco nut? a lover of the rain forest. 
you can tell whoever you're so afraid of that you're taking me up into 
the wild to show me jaguar or something. a regular tour. just 
cruise around, taking in the sights. total innocent. and then if we 
accidental scout a little, maybe we could find the place." 

"jesus, you're serious about this, aren't you?" dupre nervous crush 
out his cigarette, staring at me glassy-eyed. 

"never been more." 

he extract another gauloise. 

"okay, a counteroffer, miss . . ." 

"james. morgan james." 

"right, miss james. i'm beginning to think you've got no realistic 
sense of proportion about this part of the world. you--" 

"fools rush in, right?" 

"my point precisely. but if steve here means what he says, well, maybe 
there's a little room to negotiate. maybe i could take you on a quick 
sightsee trip. and just for laugh i could kind of inadvertent 
stray over the area i think you might find productive. assume we can 
locate it. but here're my terms. i do it and steverino and me are 
square. consider it a twenty-thousand-dollar cruise." 

"fine with me." steve didn't even blink, and i love him all over 
again, right on the spot. though the truth was, i knew he'd never 
plan on seeing a penny of the money again anyway. 

"and you think this place is nino del mundo?" i was try not to get 
my hope up too much, but still . . . 

dupre lit his new cigarette. "you didn't hear this from me, okay? you 
heard it from the embassy or some other damn place. but that's one 
name for it. another is 'jungle disneyland.' actually, i think the 
local name is _baalum_, the old maya word for jaguar. but everybody 
acts like it's a state secret, so all you get are rumors." 

"well, assume we find it, then how could i get in? i mean actually 
in." i was squint at him, feeling my body tense. what was it lou had 
said about a word he'd heard when they were taking sarah? it sound 
like "babylon"? i also thought that was what she'd whisper to me. 
could it be the word was actually baalum? the gloomy morning sky 
abrupt flood with the brilliant white light of hope. i glance back 
at steve, and our eyes lock for a long moment. 

"morgy, for chrissake, what are you saying?" steve took my hand. "don't 
you realize this is guatemala? don't even think about it." 

"we're just talk now, okay?" i squeeze his hand then look back at 
dupre. "i was just wondering. once we've found it, could i get a sneak 
look-see? assume i want to?" 

"well, i'll tell you one thing, miss morgan james." dupre was fingering 
his new cigarette, oblivious to my reaction. "give no serious thought 
to just driving up. the army'd be all over your butt in the time it 
take to cock an ak-47." he glance up at the sky again, though now a 
dense bank of dark cloud had swallow what remain of the sun. a 
pre-rain gloom was envelop the park, which was start to empty 
out, the hawker and loiter head home to wait out the weather. 
"but if we do find it, then as long as we're there, i might be able to 
drop you off for a quick glance somehow, say, if we did it around 
twilight time . . . that is, if that's what you want. but it's ten 
minutes tops, and that's my final offer. frankly, i think you'd be 
ill-advised in the extreme to do it, but . . . in any case, it's got to 
be a low-profile enterprise all the way. we screw this up and we could 
easily swell the ranks of the 'disappeared.' " 

"but you think you could actually locate it?" 

"what i hear, the place is on a tributary of the usumacinta river, a 
latrine they call the rio tigre. way up in the northwest. low-level 
army types, you meet them in bar from time to time, like to bs about 
it. i've got a rough idea where it might be, though you don't know 
whether to believe a bunch of kid recruit after half-a-dozen beers." 

then my mind clicked. the rio tigre? didn't that have something to do 
with where lou said sarah was found? that was definitely where i want 
to go. 

"morgy, have you lost your senses?" steve had placed his hand on my 
shoulder. "if the army's involved in something down here, you don't 
want to know about it. don't lose sight of the fact those goon knock 
off two hundred thousand villager since the freedom-loving days of the 
gipper, for fear they might be commies, with the cia practically flying 
in the ammo. this whole damn country's just one big mass grave. yet 
another unclaimed corpse or two won't make a hell of a lot of 
difference." 

"steve, i'll bet you anything that's where she is." saying it, i had a 
vision of all the things that had happen to me, and to sarah, because 
of alex goddard. i couldn't wait to confront the bastard. "he's brought 
her back." 

steve just glare at me for a long moment, despairing. 

"christ, you make me nuts. okay, look, how about this? at least let me 
come with you. that way we'll face the unknown together." 

though i had a lump-in-the-throat moment, i didn't say anything, just 
stood there glory in the feeling of being together. it was so 
wonderful to have him with me and so difficult to think about pressing 
on without him. 

there was a long, awkward pause, and then he glance at his watch. 
"blast, i've got to hit the road if i'm go to get back in time to 
set up for tonight's shoot. i just pray i can beat the rain." then he 
pull me around and circle me fully in his arms. "please, 
morgy, i really don't like the sound of this. i'll move heaven and 
earth to get back here by friday night, and if you still want to check 
out this '_baalum' _place, then we'll figure out a way to do it 
together." 

"just you stay safe." i hug him back. "nothing i do is go to mean 
much if i don't have you. don't worry. i'll be okay." 

alan dupre had abrupt taken an even deep interest in the darken 
sky. i got the feeling he was uncomfortable being around two people 
capable of caring. 

"it's only for a couple of days," steve went on. "we'll both be okay if 
we just stick together." 

"right," i said, and kiss him hard than i ever had. 

five minutes later, my heart and my head still at war with each other, 
i was alone in the virtually empty park with my brand-new best friend. 
watch steve's jeep blend into the smoggy haze of the avenue made me 
feel like half of me had just disappear into another dimension. 

"so that's that," i declared finally, turning back and taking a deep 
breath. i had to find sarah before something else truly horrible 
happen to her. and the one thing i was determined to do was keep 
steve as safe distant from my search as i could, even though it meant 
i was go to be terribly lonely for the next few days. "when can we 
leave?" 

"hey, get real." dupre choked, whirl around. "we can't go today. 
case you hadn't noticed, there's a storm coming. if you really want to 
go . . . and i mean really want to, then maybe in a day or so. 
preferable when steve--" 

"i don't want to drag him into this," i said evenly. truthfully, i was 
sound brave than i felt. but then i remember once go down into 
the four-hundred-year-old subterranean harem quarters of the red fort 
in agra, seemingly mile underground and pitch black, with nothing but 
a flashlight, surround by scream bats and knee-deep in guano, for 
no better reason than i was determined to see how the women there once 
lived. so how much scary could this be? 

"well, i say no way," dupre told me. "not today. correction, make that 
no fucking way." he had remove his aviator shades and was clean 
them with a dirty hanky. "besides, i don't think you have any business 
go up there in the first place. if you're not scared shitless, you 
ought to be." 

"alan, i think you 're the one who's afraid to go." 

he almost reach for another cigarette, but then stop himself. "i 
will definitely plead guilty to a deep-seated disquiet about the people 
who rule this placid paradise. but if it'll square things with steve, 
then i'll take you up to have a quick look, for my sins. but it's got 
to be after the weather clears." 

i finally realize he was already thinking about his next loan. steve, 
beware. 

"tomorrow then?" i wasn't go to blink, because the peten was where 
sarah had end up the first time and i was sure that was where ramo 
had taken her now. _baalum_. 

dupre stare at the sky a moment longer, then caved. "maybe we can 
shoot for tomorrow late. if i can convince myself this storm has done 
its worst." he look back at me. "but i gotta tell you one thing, ms. 
morgan james. we blunder in up there and end up get ourselves 
'disappeared,' we won't even get our pictures in the papers. you'd 
better tell your immediate love one where you're going, and it 
wouldn't be the worst time in the world to think about making a will." 

the way he said it, i was sure for once he meant every word. 




chapter eighteen 


when i got back to the camino real, the time was early afternoon and 
the bed was freshly made, with all sign and scent of my and steve's 
torrid reunion long gone. i try to push aside thought of how much i 
was already missing him and focus on what i was get myself into. i 
must admit i was have serious qualm about go up to the peten, the 
part of guatemala where sarah had been left for dead, with my brand-new 
tour director, the flaky alan dupre. i'd never been in a helicopter 
before, much less one flying over a stormy rain forest. on the other 
hand, if that was where they'd taken sarah, the soon i got there, the 
better. 

sitting there in the room, i found myself feeling right at home: 
everything about it was so familiar to an expert on budget travel like 
me. off-brand carpet the color of decay vegetation, the usual two 
double bed (one total unused, except as a suitcase shelf), the tv 
suspend over the dresser and bolt to the wall. funny, but it was 
the first time i'd notice half the things in the room. 

okay, i told myself, the thing to do first is call st. vincent's and 
check on lou. also, i want to tell him what was happening. i just 
hope he wouldn't launch into a lecture about the reckless of what 
i was planning. i need support, not male advice. 

i got the desk to give me the local at&t contact number, 

then rang right through to st. vincent's. the next thing i knew, they 
were calling his room. 

"hi. how's the patient?" 

"morgan, what the hell are you up to? i've been try to reach you. i 
finally call david and he said you'd left a message; something about 
central america. why the hell--?" 

"i was try to explain that to you sunday night, but you were pretty 
far gone." 

"well, i ain't that far gone now, so i'm telling you to--" 

"by the way," i interrupted, hope to change the subject, "how're you 
feeling?" 

"i guess i'll live. they let me get up and go to the bathroom now. 
they're saying i can probably go home tomorrow." 

"that's encouraging." thank god he was go to be okay. 

"i also had a talk with gerry, downtown. he believe sarah was 
kidnapped, even if new york's finest don't, so that means the fbi has 
jurisdiction. we're gonna get some action. they're try to get a 
photo of that colonel, so maybe i can id the bastard. but the 
consulate's give us a lot of shit about it." 

"well, i'm track something down here. between the two of us, i think 
we'll find her." 

"so, what the hell are you doing?" 

i told him about finding the name of a destination on sarah's old 
landing card, and about meeting a guy who was go to take me there as 
soon as the weather cleared. 

"and you think she could be there now?" he didn't sound hopeful. 

"there're reason to check it out." i didn't want to elaborate. "maybe 
we'll get lucky." 

i was attempt to say as little as possible, fear the phone was 
tapped. in that spirit, i decided to get off the line as quick as 
possible. 

"lou, you get lot of rest, and i'll try and call you tomorrow." 

with a final warning to watch out for myself, he took down my hotel 
number and hung up. truthfully, he was sound pretty tired and weak, 
not nearly his old self. 

well, he had a right to be. but at least there were no complications. 

my next call was go to be to david roth, to check in on things at 
applecore, but first i want to order up some_ huevo rancheros_, get 
some breakfast protein. i was becoming energize by the prospect of 
progress, and being that way always make me ravenous. it's probably a 
primal female response that has a latin name. 

i checked out the number for room service, and was literally reach 
for the black phone when it rang of its own accord. startle i picked 
up the receiver, wonder who had my number. 

"hello." it was a man's voice that sound vague familiar. "thought 
i'd check in and see how things are go with your search." 

"hi," i answer back after a pause, try to place his intonation. 

"oh, sorry. barry morton. remember me? fortress america. you came by 
the office yesterday." 

"how . . . ?" why was he calling me? "how did you get this--?" 

"you must have accidental put the wrong hotel on your landing card as 
your address in guatemala city." he hesitate a second then said "but i 
had my secretary call around and . . . well, it happen all the time." 

"i see." it did have the ring of logic. and i had put down a different 
hotel. a safety measure. "do you always take this much . . . interest 
in your fellow citizens?" 

"only when they come to see me personally." he chuckled. "so how's it 
going?" 

"well, thanks for calling," i said. "everything's moving along." 

"good, good." there was another pause, then, "incidentally, you have 
any luck finding that nino del mundo place you were look for?" 

i hesitated, wonder why he would ask and also unsure what to say. 

"not yet," i volunteered. my god, it finally dawn on me. the guy was 
track me. he want to know what i knew. "you come up with anything 
at your end?" 

"i've been busy, a string of meetings, but i still think you might want 
to check out the phone book." it was the second time he'd made the 
suggestion. he was practically order me to do it. why? "you never 
know. i'm afraid that's about the best i can do." 

"maybe i will," i said. "i've been a little busy too." 

the phone call was feeling stranger and stranger. he was send me to 
see something, probably in hope it would make me go away. it was 
actually more unnerve than if he'd done nothing at all. 

"well, in any case, i hope you have a good visit," he declared 
diplomatically. another pause. "planning to be here long?" 

"i'm not sure yet." why did he want to know that? 

"i see. whatever happens, i hope you find what you're look for. best 
of luck." 

he hung up, leave me with the feeling he already knew the answer to 
every question he'd asked. the guy at the airport, and now the 
embassy--i was the best-known tourist in the country. 

okay, maybe i should just play along and see what happens. in any case, 
i'd just lost my appetite for fry egg with hot sauce, but i had a 
definite interest in the phone book. 

and there they were. nino del mundo. complete with an address, way out 
the boulevar r. aguilar batres. 

well, why not see where it leads you? sarah's card said the place was 
in the peten, but who knows? 

i got up off the bed and went into the bathroom for a shampoo and 
shower. despite the fact that barry morton want me to see this nino 
del mundo place, whatever it was, i didn't want to show up look and 
smell like some bedraggled tourist. i'd wear my tailor blue suit, 
which, along with the dark blue heels, ought to make me look adequate 
businesslike. 

the shower was wonderful, purge away the soot of the park, and i was 
wrapping my hair in a large beige towel when the phone jangle again. i 
tuck in the edge to secure it and walk over. maybe it was lou 
ring back. 

no such luck. the caller was none other than my brand-new partner alan 
dupre. i was not thrill to hear his voice. was he about to get cold 
feet and back out? 

"morgan, listen," he said, not waste time on niceties, "there's been 
a small change of plans. i've--" 

"alan, don't do this to me." you shit. "you agreed--" 

"no, why i'm calling is, we've got to go ahead and go up today, storm 
or no, god help us. you happy now?" 

what? after that neurotic song-and-dance he'd just given me in the 
park? i should have been overjoyed, but something about the whole thing 
immediately felt synthetic. i pause a long moment, try to think the 
situation through. what was go on? 

the answer to that was clear as day. i was being set up. somebody 
want me out of town, and they'd just found a way. 

or was i being paranoid again? had the weather cleared? i reach over 
and pushed aside a curtain. nope, it look as threaten as ever. 

no question. this was definitely a setup. 

on the other hand why not use whoever had put him up to this? this told 
me for sure i was on the trail of sarah, and the soon i got going, 
the better. aside from calling new york and then check out the local 
nino del mundo that barry morton want me to see so badly, i had no 
other pressing plans. . . . 

"alan, i thought you declared no 'effing' way were you go to go 
today," i said test him. "why the sudden revision in scheduling?" 

"yeah, well, something heavy's come up for tomorrow. i'm afraid it's 
gotta be now or forget it for at least a week." 

unrefined bullshit. but somebody knew how badly i want to go. 

"look, there's something i need to check out first. i just learned 
about a place here in town i want to at least see. it's also call 
nino del mundo." 

"no shit." he paused. "okay, we'll talk about it. get the address and 
maybe we can cruise by if there's time. thing is, we don't have all 
that much leeway here." 

"one last question." i thought i'd give him a final shot at the truth. 
"just tell me honestly why it has to be today. the real story." 

"like i said everything's changed." he wasn't budging. "so if we're 
do this, i've got to pick you up now and get us on our merry way." 

he was too cheerful by half, which definitely told me he was lying. 

"all right, but i really need to make at least one phone call first." i 
want steve to know where i was. "and if i walk out of here with a 
bag, i've got to let the desk know i'm not skip on the bill." 

"forget the phone call. no time. do it after we get back. just be out 
front in exactly nineteen minutes. this is not a dry run. the train is 
leaving. i'm outta here now." 

there was a click and he was gone. 

i sat there a moment staring at the floor. what was i get into? 

well, there's one way to find out. play their game and beat them. 
there's no better way to get inside what's go on. 

the first thing i did was call steve's hotel in belize city. of course 
he wasn't there, but i left a long message to the effect that i was 
taking a "sightseeing" trip up to the peten with alan dupre today 
because of unforeseen new circumstances. the reason were complicated, 
but i'd watch out for myself and therefore he shouldn't worry. 

that out of the way, i look around the room. it was a disaster, but i 
quick began cram things into the small fold backpack i always 
took on trips. then i rang the kitchen and told them to make up a 
quadruple egg sandwich (_quatro huevos, por favor_) to go, along with a 
large bottle of distill water. 

by the time i got to the reception desk and explain i wasn't actually 
check out for good, alan dupre was already wait outside in his 
batter green jeep, clean his scratchy shades and leaning on the 
horn. 

let him wait. i wrote out a long note to steve, on the chance he might 
come look for me. then with deliberate slowness, i wander out to 
where alan's jeep was park and toss my backpack behind the seat. 

"first things first." i climb in and hand him the address of nino 
del mundo i'd copy onto some hotel stationery. "this is where we've 
got to go." 

he stare at it a moment, puzzling, and then seem to figure out where 
it was. 

"upscale part of this beautiful oasis." he shift into gear. "but it's 
more or less on the way." he glance up nervous at the sky. "we just 
don't have all day." 

off we head toward the suburbs, through a ganglia of downtown street 
lace with pizza joint and frying-meat vendors, till we eventually 
end up on a tree-lined avenue that look as genteel as oyster bay. 
when we got to the address, i told him to park across the way, and just 
sat a moment staring. 

the building itself was a windowless compound surround by tree and a 
high wall of white stucco, with a guardhouse and wide iron gate (not 
unusual for guatemala) protect a long walkway. the whole thing 
look like a fortress, except the view through the gate was a pastoral 
vista of neat flower bed and a pristine lawn. the guardhouse itself 
had a doze teenager, undoubted with an uzi rest across his lap. 

"okay, alan," i said "time to get with the program. how's your spanish?" 

"depends on who i'm try to bs." he shrug and began clean his 
sunglasses again. 

"well, why don't you see if you can talk us past that guard." 

he stare at the entrance a moment. "be a waste of our precious time. 
tell you right now, kid like that only answer to one boss, the _jefe_, 
the big guy, whoever he is. that's how they retain their employment. a 
joint lock down this tight don't give sunday tours." 

"well, i think he's asleep. so i'm go to be creative and see if 
there's a back entrance of some kind. maybe a service area that'll give 
me some idea of what's go on here." 

"do what you want, but make it fast," he said, leaning back in the 
seat. "and try not to get shot." 

i careful got out and walk down the empty street a way, then 
follow the stucco wall/fence--the building cover an entire city 
block--until i came across an alley entrance, with another large iron 
gate, padlock shut. 

i peer up the driveway, shroud in overhang trees, but there was 
nothing in the parking lot except a couple of army jeeps. and a black 
land rover. 

well, barry morton really want me to see this. but why? is there a 
connection to the place in the peten? and what are the army vehicle 
all about? 

i sigh and made my way back to the street. when i reach the jeep, 
alan was gone, but then i realize he was over talk to the young 
guard, offering him a cigarette. a few moments later he wave good-bye 
and casual amble back. 

"okay." he settled in and hit the ignition. "here's the official deal. 
this place is some kind of hospice for unwed mothers. they also take in 
orphans, or so he thinks. according to him, no america women have ever 
had anything to do with the place, which is probably why i'd never 
heard of it." he glance at me as we sped off. "you happy now? 
debrief young army dude is a specialty of mine, so i think that's 
probably the straight scoop." 

"did you ask if it's connected with something in the peten?" i was 
still hoping. in any case, whatever it was, i was collect more 
pieces of the puzzle. 

"hey, give me a break." he shift up, gain speed. "i know when to 
push, and this wasn't the precise moment. the kid was itchy enough as 
it was. like, who the fuck are you, gringo, and what are you do 
here? i got all i could get without a cold _cerveza_." he glance over. 
"you ask me, a little gratitude wouldn't be entire out of place." 

"okay. _muchas gracias, amigo_. happy now?" 

"ecstatic." 

the jeep was open and i checked out the sky, which was grow dark 
and more threaten by the minute. the promise foul weather still 
seem to be just that, promise but it was definitely on the way. alan 
dupre must really be scared. finally i lean back in the torn plastic 
seat and closed my eyes. 

was this nino del mundo the latin branch of children of light? the 
place where alex goddard's baby came from? considering the interest 
colonel ramo had in my movie, the army jeep could be a tip-off. also, 
there seem to be an even chance that barry morton was involved 
somehow. but it was all still guesswork. and anyway, this wasn't the 
place sarah had put on her landing card. _that _ninos del mundo was 
somewhere up north, hidden in the rain forest. 

ready or not, sar, hang on. 




chapter nineteen 


"what did he say?" i asked, not quite catching the burst of rapid-fire 
spain from the cockpit. the explosion of expletive had included the 
word _navegacion_. something about malfunction. 

god help us. 

alan dupre's helicopter remind me of the disintegrate taxi on 
guatemala city's pothole streets. the vibration in the passenger 
compartment was so violent it made my teeth chatter. my stomach felt 
like it was in a cocktail shaker, and the deafen roar could have 
been the voice of hell. 

i was staring out the smudgy plastic window, where less than three 
hundred meter below i could just make out the top of the peten rain 
forest of northwest guatemala sweeping by beneath us. so this was what 
it look like. dense and impenetrable, it was a yawning, deciduous 
carpet envelop the earth as far as the eye could see--if something 
ten story high could be call carpet. i'd been in the forest of 
india's kerala and seen some of the dense growth in southern mexico, 
but this was like another planet. 

the main problem was, a violent downpour, the leading edge of the 
hurricane, was now sweeping across the yucatan, stirring up the 
treetop of the jungle below. the rain, which had begun in earnest 
about ten minutes after we got airborne, had been steady increase 
to the point it was now almost blinding. 

this was the risk i'd chosen to take, but let me admit right here: the 
weather had me seriously scared, my fingernail digging into the 
armrest and my pulse erratic. and now was there something else? we'd 
only been in the air for thirty-five minutes, and already we had some 
kind of mechanical issue looming? what was left to go wrong? 

"some of the lights went out or something." dupre try a shrug. "i'm 
not sure. no big deal, though. this old bird always get the job done." 
his pilot, lieutenant villatoro, formerly of the guatemala army, had 
just shout the new development back to the cabin. "probably nothing. 
don't worry about it." 

don't worry about it! his "tourist" helicopter was a guatemala 
candidate for the air & space museum, an old bell uh-1d patch 
together with chicle and corn masa. surely the storm was push it far 
beyond its stress limits. 

"right, but what exactly--?" 

"sounds like the nav station." he click open his seat belt. 
"something . . . who knows? if you'd be happier, i'll go up and look." 

i felt my palm go cold. "doesn't seem too much to ask, considering." 

the world down below us was a hostile mélange of towering trees, all 
strain for the sky, while the ground itself was a dark tangle of 
ferns, lianas, strangle vines, creepers--among which lurk olympic 
scorpion and some of the earth's most poisonous snakes. if we had to 
set down here--i didn't even want to think about it. to lower a 
helicopter into the wave of flicker green below us would be to 
confront the hereafter. 

"it's just the lights, like he said." dupre yell back from the 
cockpit's door, letting a tone of "i told you to chill out" seep 
through. he was peer past the opening, at the long line of 
instruments. he follow his announcement with a sigh as he move back 
into the main cabin. "relax." 

i wasn't relax and from the way his eyes were shift and his 
gauloise cigarette were being chain-smoked he was on the verge of a 
nervous breakdown. in his case it wasn't just the weather. he was 
fidget like a trap animal, give me the distinct sense he was 
do someone's invisible bidding and was terrify he might fail. 

"well, why don't you try and fix it?" was he try to act calm just to 
impress me? "can't you bang on the panel or something?" 

"okay, okay, let me see what i can do. jesus!" he edge back into the 
cockpit, next to villatoro. the wind was shake us so badly that, even 
bent over, he was have trouble keeping his balance. then he 
halfhearted slam the dark instrument readout with the heel of his 
open hand. when the effort produce no immediate electronic miracle, he 
settled into the copilot's seat. 

"_que pasa_? " he yell at villatoro, his voice barely audible over 
the roar of the engine and the plastering of rain on the fuselage. then 
he look out the windscreen, at the torrent slam against it, and 
rub at his chin. 

"_no se, mi comandante_," the guatemala shout back. i sense he was 
hope to sound efficient and unperturbed. dupre claim his pilot had 
personally checked out the bell and prep it. now, though . . . 
"_mira_. like i said the lights. on the nav station. maybe the 
electrical--" 

"how about the backup battery?" dupre was just barely keeping his cool. 

villatoro scratch his chin. "i'll tell you the truth. the backup is 
_muerto_. i test it before we left, but i couldn't find any 
replacement in provisiones. i figure, no problem, but now, amigo . . ." 

i felt another wave of dismay, right into my churn stomach. 

"well, keep your heading north." dupre's voice was coming from a place 
of extreme pain. "and if you sight the rio tigre, then _baalum_ or 
whatever should be more or less due west, according to what i'm 
assuming. just keep your eyes open." he paused. "problem is, with all 
this rain, the river's go to be tough to make out." 

i redouble my effort to peer out the window, searching, my breath 
coming in bursts. still nothing. dear god, what now? 

finally dupre head back, bracing himself against the firewall as he 
crouch and pass through the door into the main cabin. when he 
settled into the seat across from me, he was glaring at me as though 
everything was my fault. "you know." he was yell again. "i'm 
beginning to think maybe we ought to try to find a clearing and just 
sit out this crap till morning." he lean over and peer down through 
the bell's spatter side window at the dense tangle of growth below. 
after a moment he got up and once more move the toward the cockpit, 
still with the same trouble look. this time, however, he was beam 
as he shout back. 

"there may be a god after all. i think we just intersect the rio 
tigre. we can bear due west now, along the river. we could be get 
close, if it's where i think it is." 

i turn and stare down again, barely making out the thread of the 
stream through the rain. yes! maybe there's hope. still, below us the 
windblown treetop were a solid mass of pastel sparkles, a dance sea 
of hungry green . . . but then i thought i saw something. hey! it might 
even be a clearing. i quick unbuckle and made my way up to the 
cockpit, hanging on to anything i could grasp. 

"alan, look," i yelled, and pointed off to the side, out 

through the rain-obscured windscreen. "i think we just pass over 
something. back there. see?" 

"where?" he squinted. 

"you can still just make it out." i twist and kept pointing. i was 
biting my lip, try to hold together. "there . . . it looks like some 
kind of clearing. maybe . . . i don't know, but what if we just set 
down there and let this storm blow over?" 

he ordered villatoro to bank and go back for a look. a few moments 
later it was obvious there was an opening in the trees. 

"yeah, let's check it out." he then said something to villatoro and we 
start ease toward it, definitely a wide opening. the billow 
ocean of tree below us seem to be parting like the red sea as we 
settled in. there had to be solid ground down there somewhere. had to 
be. 

"what's . . ." i was pointing. "there, over to the side, it's a kind of 
hill or something. it's--" 

"where?" dupre squint again, his voice start to crack. then he 
focus in. "yeah, maybe there's something there. hard to tell what it 
is, though. but i guess we're about to find out." 

he gesture to the lieutenant, bark an order in quick spanish. while 
the bell kept moving lower through the opening, dupre flick on the 
landing lights, and appear to be mutter a prayer of thanks. 

i was staring out, grow ever more puzzled. a "hill" was there, all 
right. the problem was, it was definitely man-made, top by a stone 
building. i could just make it out in the glare of the lights. 

"what do you think that is?" 

"what do i think?" dupre studied the scene for a moment longer, and 
then his face melt into the first smile i'd seen since we left. "i 
think we are lucky beyond belief. god help us, we may have found it. 
that could be the damn pyramid or whatever's supposed to be up here." 
he lean back. "yeah, congratulations. look at that damn thing. 
either this is the place, or we're about to become the archaeologist 
of the year. cover of _time_. the nobel frigging prize." 

at that moment i almost want to hug alan dupre, but not quite. 
instead i move farther into the cockpit, try to get a look out the 
windscreen. by then we had lower well through the opening in the 
trees, the helicopter's control fight against the blow rain, and 
it felt as though we'd begun descend into the ocean's depths in a 
dive bell, surround by thrashing, wind-whipped branches. 

now, though, i was staring at the ghostly rise of the pyramid emerge 
out of the rain. 

"it looks brand new." 

"yeah, the whole place is 'jungle disneyland' remember? except this 
deal ain't about mickey mouse, believe me. there's plenty of army 
hanging out around here." 

lieutenant villatoro took us ever lower, gently guide the chopper's 
descent, and now we were only a few feet above the ground. there 
certainly was no mistake what was around us, even with the blow 
rain. the pyramid loom over one side of a large plaza, a big paved 
area that was mostly obscure from the sky since the sway tree 
arch over and cover it from aerial view. 

"okay, we're about to touch down." dupre was claw at his pocket, 
yearning for a cigarette. "so if you still want to get out, move over 
by the door. i'll disengage the main rotor once we're on the ground." 

as we settled in, the rotor began to cause surface effect, throw a 
spray off the paving stones, which now glisten under the cold beam of 
the landing lights. and loom above us, off to the right, was a 
step pyramid in the classic mayan style. we all lapsed into silence 
as the bell's skid thump onto the stones. the ex-army pilot, 
villatoro, kept glancing over at the pyramid as though he didn't want 
to admit even seeing it. did he know something alan and i didn't? 

this was the moment i'd been bracing for. i was increasingly convinced 
somebody want me to see this place, whatever it was, but now what 
should i do? 

well, the first thing was to dip my toe in the water, do a quick 
reconnoiter on the ground. if this really was _baalum_, dupre's maya 
disneyland, could it also be part of alex goddard's clinic of 
"miracles," the location sarah call nino del mundo? if i knew that 
for sure, then i could start figure how to find out if she was 
here--as i suspected--and get her out of his clutches. maybe the 
see-no-evil embassy might even be prod into helping an america 
citizen for a change. 

"i'm get out, to look around a little, but not till you turn off 
the engine. i want to be able to use my ears." 

"all right, but don't take all day. this kind of weather, i want to 
keep it warm." he turn to villatoro and shout the order. in the 
sheet of pounding rain, i figured that no one could have heard us come 
in. that, at least, was positive. 

when the rpm's of the engine had die away, i click open the bell's 
wide door, slid it back, and look around. in the glare of the landing 
lights i realize at once that the stone were old, weathered, and 
worn, but the grout that seal them was white and brand new. the plaza 
was free of moss, clean as the day it was done--which did not appear to 
be all that long ago. above me, the pyramid, continuous recess tier 
of glisten stones, tower into the dim skyline of trees. 

i step out onto the pavement, holding my breath. the plaza was 
almost football-field in size, remind me of an italy piazza. 
around me the rain was lessen slightly, and as my eyes adjust . . 
. my god. there wasn't just a pyramid here; through the sparkle of 
raindrop at the edge of the helicopter's lights i could see what 
look like a wide cobblestone walkway leading into the dense growth 
just off the edge of the square, probably toward the south, away from 
the river, connect the plaza with distant group of small, 
thatch-roofed houses, set in clusters. . . . 

could alex goddard's "miracle" clinic be in some collection of 
primitive huts? it made no sense. 

but i decided to try to get a close look. i'd walk about thirty feet 
away from the helicopter, across the slippery paving, when i saw a 
flash of lightning in the southeast, follow by a boom of thunder that 
echo over the square. 

at least i thought it was thunder. or maybe the army was holding heavy 
artillery practice somewhere nearby. abrupt the rain turn into a 
renew torrent, and the next thing i heard was the helicopter's engine 
start up again. then i sense the main rotor engage, a sudden "whoom, 
whoom, whoom" quick spiral upward in frequency. 

hey! i told him not to--! 

when i look back at the bell's open door, dupre was standing there, 
frantic searching the dark as he heave out my tan backback and 
what look like a rolled-up sleep bag, both splash down onto the 
rain-soaked paving. 

what! for a moment i thought the thunder, or whatever it was, must have 
completely freak him. then what was actually happening hit me with a 
horrify impact. 

"alan, wait!" 

i start dashing back, but now the main rotor was create a powerful 
downdraft, throw the rain into me like a monsoon. by the time i 
manage to fight my way through the spray, the rotor was on full power 
and alan dupre and his bell were already lift off. i reach up, and 
just manage to brush one greasy skid as he churn away straight 
upward into the rainy night. 

"you shit!" i yell up, but my final farewell was lost in the whine of 
the engine. my god, i thought, watch him disappear, i've just been 
abandoned hundred of mile deep in a central america rain forest. 

then it all sank in. whoever had gotten to him was play a rough 
game. they didn't want me just to see _baalum_, they want me 
deliver here. probably to secure me in the same place sarah was. 
colonel ramos, or whoever had frightened dupre into bring me, had 
want us both. so what now? were we both go to be "disappeared"? 
staring around at the pyramid and the empty square, i could feel my 
heart pounding. 

then i trip over the roll sleep bag and sank to my knee there 
in the middle of the rain-swept plaza, soaked to the skin and so angry 
i was actually trembling. up above me, alan dupre, king of two-timers, 
had switch off his landing lights, and a few moments later the hum of 
the bell was swallow by the night sound of the forest--the 
high-pitched din of crickets, the piercing call of night birds, the 
basso groan of frog celebrate the storm. 

and something else, an eerie sense of the unnatural. i can't explain 
it. even the night song of the bird felt ominous, the primeval forest 
reassert its will. it was haunting, like nature's mockery of my 
desolation. i pound the sleep bag and felt . . . shit, how did i 
let this happen? 

get a grip. i finally stood up and look around. maybe when god wants 
to do you up right, she give you what you want. you use alan dupre 
just like you intended: he got you here. but there's more to the plan 
of whoever's holding his puppet strings. so the thing now is, don't let 
yourself be manipulate any more. get off your soggy butt and start 
taking control of the situation. . . . 

that was when i sighted a white form at the south, forest edge of the 
plaza. what! i duck down, sure it was somebody lurk there, wait 
to try to beat me to death as they had sarah. did ramo intend to just 
murder me immediately? 

but there was no get away. if i could see them, they surely could 
see me. and where would i escape to anyway? 

i dug my yellow plastic flashlight out of my backpack and my hand 
shaking, flick it on. the beam, however, was just swallow up in the 
rain. all right. i strap on the pack and taking a deep breath, threw 
the roll sleep bag over my shoulder and head across the slippery 
paving toward the white, which now glisten in the periodic sheet of 
distant lightning. 

meet them straight on. try and bluff. 

when i got closer, though, i realize what i was seeing was actually 
just the skin of a jaguar, bleach white, the head still on, fearsome 
teeth bare which had been hung beside the paved pathway. thank god. 

but then, play my light over it, i thought, bad sign. my first 
encounter at _baalum_ is with a spooky, dead cat. it felt like a 
chill omen of . . . i wasn't sure what. 

i studied it a moment long with my flashlight, shivering, then turn 
and head quick across the plaza toward the pyramid now barely 
visible in the rain. if there were jaguars, or god know what else, 
around i figured i'd be safe up at the top. 

when i reach the base and shine my light up the steps, i saw they 
were steep than i'd thought, but they also look to be part of some 
meticulous restoration and brand-new, probably safe to climb. and there 
at the top was a stone hut, complete with what appear to be a roof. 
good. if there hadn't been anything tall than it around i think i 
might have just climb a tree. 

on the way up i began try to digest what the place really was. the 
pyramid was "fake". . . or was it? a hundred years ago the eccentric 
brit archaeologist sir arthur evans whimsical "reconstructed" the 
palace of mino on crete with his own money, and it's still a tourist 
highlight. so why couldn't somebody do the same with a reclaim mayan 
pyramid in central america? still, this was different, had the feel of 
being somebody's craze obsession. 

as i top the steps, i realize the building that crown the pyramid 
was also a "restoration" like everything else, including a decorate 
wooden lintel above the door that look to be newly lacquered. bizarre. 

i move through the door and unload my gear, then extract my water 
bottle, now half-empty, for a pull. finally i unroll alan dupre's 
sleep bag on the (dry) stone floor, remove and spread out my wet 
clothes, peed off the edge, then took a new pair of underpants, jeans, 
and shirt out of my backpack, don them, and uneasy crawl in. i 
was shivering--whether from the soaking rain or from fright, i didn't 
know--and my teeth were try to chatter. was i hidden away enough to 
be safe? i didn't know. all i did know was, i was in something deep 
than i'd ever been in my life, and i had no idea how i was go to get 
out. and i was both scared to death and angry as hell. 

sarah was here, though, i was certain. like a sixth sense, i could feel 
her presence, out there somewhere in the rain. for a moment i was 
tempt to just plunge into the storm look for her, but a split 
second's reflection told me that was the stupidest thing i could do. 
instead, i should try and get some rest, till the storm cleared, and 
keep periodic watch on the plaza in case somebody show up. then, the 
minute there was light, i'd hit the ground and go find her. 

i suppose nothing ever happen the way you plan. my mind was racing and 
my nerves were in the red, but i was so exhaust from the 
teeth-rattling trip in the bell i couldn't really stay alert very long. 
in spite of myself, i eventually drift off into a dreamless doze, a 
victim of the narcotic song of wind in the giant cebia tree and the 
insistent drum of forest rain on the roof. 




chapter twenty 


i awoke as a sliver of sun flash through the stone doorway of the 
room and forest bird erupt around me in celebration. as i pull 
myself up and move over to the opening, a quick tropical glare burn 
into my face. my god, the dawn was electric; it was the purest blue i'd 
ever seen, a swath of artist's cobalt. an azure radiance from the sky 
glisten off the rain forest leaves around me. had i dream the 
stormy, haunt world of the night before? 

when i look down, everywhere below me was a bank of dense, pastel 
mist. was the plaza really there or had i imagine it? i felt like the 
top of the pyramid was floating on a cloud. 

"babylon." that was what sarah had call this place. ancient and 
mysterious. i took a breath of the morning air and wonder what would 
draw her back here. was _baalum _the ultimate escape from her other 
life? even so . . . why would she want to return after somebody had 
try to murder her? what was wait down there in the fog? 

turning back, i notice that the room's inside wall were emboss with 
row and row of classic mayan glyphs, like little cartoon faces, all 
mold in newly set plaster. to my groggy sight they seem playful, 
harmless little caricatures, though next to them were raise 
bas-reliefs of warrior in battle dress. it was both sublime austere 
and eerie, even creepy. 

i knelt down and roll my sleep bag, try to clear my head. then 
i stuff my still-moist clothes into my backpack and thought about the 
river, the rio tigre, down somewhere at the back of the pyramid. and i 
felt my pulse rate edging up. the first thing i want to do was see it 
in the light of day. it had been sarah's way out, the only thing i knew 
for sure she'd touched. 

get go and do it. 

i head through the rear door and down the back steps. when i reach 
the ground, the dense forest closed in around me, but i was certain the 
river lay dead ahead, through the tangle of trees. as i move down a 
path that grew ever steeper, the canopy up above thickened, arch 
over me till it blot out the pure blue of the sky. and the air was 
fill with nature sounds--birdcalls, trills, songs, and clacks, all 
mingle with the hum and buzz of insects. then suddenly, from somewhere 
up in the canopy, a pack of screech spider monkey began fling 
rotten mango down in my direction. i also thought i heard the 
asthmatic, territorial roar of a giant howler monkey, the lord of the 
upper jungle. and what about snakes? i kept an eye on the vine and 
tendril alongside the path, expect any moment to stumble across a 
deadly fer-de-lance, a little red-and-black operator whose poison head 
straight for your nervous system. 

on the other hand, the birds, the forest birds, were everywhere, 
scarlet macaw and keel-billed toucan and dart flock of amazon 
parrots, brilliant and iridescent, their sweeping tails a psychedelic 
rainbow of green, yellow, red. then the next thing i knew, the path i 
was on abrupt open onto a mossy expanse of pea-soup green, surely 
the rio tigre, and . . . 

my god, those dark-brown bump scattered everywhere . . . they're the 
eyes and snout of . . . yes, crocodiles, lurk there in wait, hope 
i'm dumb enough to wade in. forget what alan dupre said. this is 
definitely not "disneyland." 

then i glance upstream and caught sight of a string of mahogany dugout 
canoe tie along the shore. they were huge, about fifteen feet long 
and three feet wide, and clearly design to be crocodile-resistant. 
they . . . 

wait a minute. lou said sarah was found in a dugout canoe that had 
drift all the way down the rio tigre to where it join the 
usumacinta. one more clue she might have been here. maybe i was close 
in. _yes!_ 

i glare back at the crocodiles' unblink reptile eyes and try to 
get my mind around the fact sarah could have stood right where i was 
standing, or been set adrift from here in a coma, to float downstream. 
seeing that vision, i felt unbidden tear trail down my cheeks. and 
the question i had kept pile up. was this the location of alex 
goddard's "miracle" clinic? why was _baalum _such a high-security 
secret? what was the connection between this place and sarah's ravage 
mind and body? i want to know all of it, and by god i would. 

this was the farthest i'd ever been from "civilization," though i was 
try not to let that fact sink in too deeply. the water was green and 
full of small aquatic creations, but i manage to find a reasonably 
unmossy spot and--still keeping an eye on the leer 
crocodiles--splashed my face. it felt good, even if it was filthy. . . . 

okay, i'd seen enough of the river. i raise up and stretched. time to 
go. 

my hope at war with my nerves, i turn my back on the scummy, fetid 
rio tigre and head back up the jungle trail toward the plaza. 

when i got there, i was struck all over again by the vision of the 
pyramid. something like it might have been here originally, but in any 
case it had been completely redone, with newly cut yellowish stone and 
white lime plaster, an exotic castle nestle in the green lap of the 
rain forest, rising above the square like a haunting presence. it must 
have been well over a hundred feet high, a stone wedding cake with a 
dozen steep tier between the ground and the platform at the top, which 
also was square and roughly fifteen feet on the side. 

standing there gaze at it, i think i'd never felt more disoriented. 
sarah, sarah, how could we both end up here, at the last outpost of the 
known world? but seeing is believing. i took a deep breath, then turn 
down the pathway toward the thatch-roofed huts. 

through the mist it was gradual becoming clear that _baalum_ actually 
was a village, and a sizable one. the walkway led past a string of 
clearings, each with cluster of one-room hut built in the ancient, 
classical style, with wall of mud over row of vertical saplings, 
their roof and porch peaked with yellow-green thatch weather to 
brown and grays. the structures, outline stark against the towering 
green arbor of the forest above, were group around paved patios. it 
all was neat and meticulous, like a jungle brigadoon. although the 
effects of the storm were everywhere--blown thatch and bamboo--i still 
felt as if i'd fallen into a time warp where clock had gone backward. 
what . . . ? 

then i began to catch the outline of people, as though they had 
materialize out of the pale fog. all pure maya, short and brown, shiny 
black hair, they appear to be just go about their daily lives. i 
was approach a workshop area where, under a wide thatch shade, men 
with chipped-flint adze were carving bowls, plows, various implement 
from mahogany and other rain forest woods. next to them, potter were 
fashion brown clay jugs. they all were wearing white loincloth and 
a large square cotton cloth knot around their shoulders, their hair 
tie back in dense ponytails. it must have been how the maya look a 
thousand years ago. 

their earnest remind me of the villager i once film in the 
yucatan for the discovery channel--with one big difference: there i was 
the big-shot gringo; here i felt like a powerless time traveler. the 
sense of being lost in another age was as compel as the "colonial" 
mock-up at williamsburg, but this was real and it was decidedly spooky. 

finally one of the men look up and notice me. our eyes lock for an 
instant--it seem like forever--and then he reach over and, in a way 
that seem breathless, shook the man next to him, gesture toward me. 
together they gaze back as though view a phantom, their brown face 
intent, and then they turn and call out to the others, alert 
them. 

what are they go to do with me? i wonder with a sudden chill. a 
stranger here in their hideaway midst. would they just turn on me? 

find some women. get off the street. 

i turn and head as fast as i could down the cobblestone central 
path, till i saw a cluster of female on a whitewash stone porch, 
long hair fall over their shoulder as they bent to their task 
beneath the thatch overhangs. some were stirring rugged clay pot of 
corn soaking in lime; other were grind the soften maize to 
tortilla thin on wide granite platters. behind them was another 
group that appear to be part of a sewing commune, young wives busy at 
their back-strap looms, layer thread after thread of dyed cotton. 
none of them was wearing a _huipil_--the traditional multicolore 
blouse i'd remember from the waitresse in the restaurant. instead, 
they all had on a kind of handloom-woven white shift i'd never seen 
before. 

talk to them. let them know you're no threat to anybody. 

as i move down the hard clay pathway toward them, two look up and 
took notice. their first reaction seem to be alarm, as they tense 
and stared. but then i try a smile and it seem to work. their looks 
turn to puzzlement, then embarrass grins, as though they want to 
be friendly but weren't sure how to acknowledge my presence. 

when i reach the porch, several reach out to touch me. one old 
woman, short and wizened and extremely brown, even try to stroke my 
hair. 

what was go on? i was taken aback, but i also was determined to get 
through to them. why not just ask them point-blank if sarah's here? is 
there any chance they understand spanish? 

"_buenos dias_." i smile and nodded. "_dispenseme. quiero descubrir . 
. . esta una gringa de los estado unido aqui? _" 

they all return uncomprehend looks, then glance quick at each 
other in confusion. or at least that was how i read their faces. 

"sarah," i said, pronounce the name slowly. "sarah crenshaw." 

"sara," one voiced, then others. they back away and immediately began 
a heated dispute, which eventually involved all the women. well, one 
thing was for sure: they damn well knew who i was ask about. but 
why were they so upset? next, several of them grew testy, point at 
me as they continue to argue. 

finally the two i'd first approach turn and began urge me to 
leave, gesture at me with their hand as though sweeping me out of 
the compound. yes, there was no mistaking. i was being dismissed. and i 
detect an odd nervous as they glance around, seemingly worried 
somebody might catch me there with them. i got the feeling they'd 
finally decided they didn't want me anywhere near them, since they kept 
point down the thoroughfare in the direction of the pyramid. 

i've blown it, i thought. they must have figured out i'm here to get 
her and decided they no long want to have anything to do with me. 
what did that mean? 

and now what do i do? as i retreat back out to the main walkway, i 
felt a grow sense of defeat. then, look down it, i realize i'd 
literally been go in a circle. it was actually a large oval that 
curve back to the main square and the pyramid, where i'd start from. 

god, what a nightmare. i obviously had to rethink my game plan, find a 
way to communicate. and on top of that, i was die of thirst. 

i fish out the almost-empty plastic container from my backpack, then 
walk across the square and settled myself on the first step leading 
up the steep front. as i drew on the bottle, my mind still swirling, i 
happen to notice an upright stone slab off to the side, like a tall, 
thin tombstone, with a bas-relief of a maya warrior on it, next to some 
kind of two-headed serpent god--probably kukulkan, one of the few maya 
deity i knew. and then, down the side, were row of lines and dots. i 
studied them a minute before realize it was the classical mayan 
number system, telling precisely when things happen to the ruler 
shown there: born on such and such a date, assume the kingship, won 
great battles, etc., all careful dated as career high-points. i knew 
that dot represent single years, horizontal lines the number five. 
the maya love numbers and numerology, so . . . 

that was when i glance up to see a group of women approach slow 
across the square, with a bunch of the men watch from the forest 
arbor beyond, and they were huddle around something they were 
carrying. whatever it was, they seem to be deliver it to me. then 
i realize they were the same one who'd just kick me out of their 
compound. what next? are they coming to drive me from the plaza too? 
should i try and forcibly search all the huts? 

but then they set down their load--it turn out to be a crude 
bamboo-and-thatch palanquin--and step aside as they beckon me 
forward. 

for a moment i just stared, disbelieving. i felt like i was seeing 
someone i didn't want to recognize, perhaps because that someone look 
so much like me. 

"morgy, they told me a new one was here, and i hope it was you." sarah 
was swinging her skinny leg off the side, her voice bright. her face 
was drawn, but her hair was neat and her eyes were radiant. "isn't 
_baalum_ the most wonderful place you've ever seen?" 

she was wearing a white shift that remind me of the blue hospital 
smock she'd had on the last time i saw her, except here it seem more 
like something that had a special significance, like the robe of an 
acolyte. her shoe were soft brown slipper that look brand-new, and 
around her waist was a braid leather band. as i stare at her, i 
wonder if she was really as transform as she looked. she was 
undeniable strong than two days ago, in spite of what that bastard 
alex goddard and his guatemala army crony had done to her to get her 
here. but still, she had to be half dead. thank god lou couldn't see 
her now. 

"sar, oh, sar." i rush over and threw my arms around her. she'd been 
freshly bath and perfumed--a fragrance like chocolate--but she felt 
like a bag of bones. "are you okay?" 

"i was afraid _baalum_ was all just a dream." she hug me back, then 
start rising to her feet. god, could she walk? "but now i remember 
everything." 

"sar, i've come to take you home." i grasp her hand, warm and soft, 
to help her stand--though it wasn't necessary. "you're not safe--" 

"no, it's wonderful now" then she turn and said something to one of 
the women. it took me a moment to realize she was speak their 
language; i guess it was kekchi maya. 

i was stunned. how did she learn it? finally she look back at me and 
switch to english again. "i didn't understand before. i was . . . 
sick so much." 

"sar, come on." i slip my arm around her. "we're go to get you 
out of here." 

i'd never felt so helpless. alan dupre had said there was a road, but 
it was control by the army. right now, i didn't even know where it 
was. maybe i could find a phone, or radio. call the embassy. there must 
be something. alex goddard has to be here somewhere, but he's not go 
to stop me. i'll strangle him if he tries. 

i hug her again, the feel of her skin-and-bones frame making my soul 
ache. but most hurtful of all, i wasn't sure she would want to leave. 

"sar, can you understand me?" i try to catch her deep blue eyes. "i'm 
taking you home. your father's very worried about you." 

mention of lou seem to finally get through to her. she turn and 
examine me with a quizzical look, and then her eyes hardened. 

"morgy, he was never there for me." her voice was fill with 
certainty, and pain. "but when i went to see dr. goddard he let me come 
here for the ceremony. it's so spiritual. after--" 

"sar, come on." what did she mean by "ceremony"? whatever it was, i had 
to get her out of this place. immediately. "we've--" 

"are you here for the ceremony?" her face flood with renew joy. 
"it's two days from now. maybe he'll let you--" 

"she should be resting." it was a harsh voice, directly behind us. 

i recoiled, then whirl around. three men were standing there, two of 
them young private in uniform of the guatemala army and carry 
ak-47 assault rifles, the one with the long, ominous curve clip steve 
call _cuerno de cabrio_, the "horn of the goat." 

the third was in a black sweatshirt and black jeans, his long 
salt-and-pepper hair tie back in a ponytail. 

"they should have known better than to bring her out here," alex 
goddard said. "not in her condition." 

the bastard. it was all coming together in my mind. he'd try to kill 
her once before, and now he was go to finish the job. but he'd have 
to kill me first. 

"i'm here to take her home." i march up to him. "you're not about to 
get away with kidnapping. i'm go to get the embassy to--" 

"she's here for important medical reasons." he met my eyes. "i hope 
you'll allow me the opportunity to help her." 

"what do you mean, 'help'?" 

"i'll explain if you'll give me a chance." he revolve and deliver 
some brusque orders in kekchi maya to the women, who nod 
apologetic and began helping sarah back onto the palanquin. after 
he admonish her in the same language, he then said something in quick 
spain to the two young army privates, who gave him a firm salute, 
turned, and walk over to pick the palanquin up, to carry it for the 
women. the sense of authority he exude remind me of that first 
morning we met at quetzal manor. his eyes flash from benign to 
demanding to benign in an instant. 

"no, damn it, _alto_!" i strode over, shove the soldier aside, and 
took her hand. "sar, honey, don't you understand what's go on? 
something terrible happen to you when you were here before. i'm so 
worried--" 

"but he say i need to stay, morgy." she drew back. "it's best. he's 
helping me." 

as i watch the two private carry her away, down the cobblestone 
pathway, ak-47's swung over their shoulders, i felt my helpless 
become complete. the army here was under his control, just like 
everything else. 

how was i go to tell lou about this, that sarah had been 
brainwashed? whatever alex goddard had done to her had turn her into 
some kind of "moonie," ready to denounce her own father. so now did i 
have two battle to wage: one with alex goddard and one with her? 

then he walk over to me. 

"i'm not go to ask how you got here, though i assume it wasn't 
easy." he smiled, like a kindly priest, and put his hand on my 
shoulder. "but however you did it, i'm glad you decided to come. it's 
important for you to be here. she needs you now." 




chapter twenty-one 


"cut the crap." i pull away, still in shock from seeing sarah so 
addled. i want more than anything else in the world just to slug him. 
"why did you bring her here? think about your answer. kidnap is a 
serious crime in the states." 

"i've been very concerned about her." he look up at the grove of 
cebia tree around the square, a quiet glance, as though to inhale the 
misty morning air. my legal threat had gone right past him--probably 
because here he was the only law. "but now she's receiving the 
treatment she needs. i expect she'll be fine before long." 

"treatment?" i was caught off guard. okay, let's start get things 
straight. "when she was here before, somebody try to beat her to 
death. how--?" 

"what happen then was beyond my control." he motion me to join him 
as he settled onto the first step of the pyramid sad in his eyes. 
we were alone in the square now, and i felt like i'd become his 
personal prisoner, trapped. "sarah was . . . is very dear to me. i care 
for her deeply." 

"you care so much for her she end up in a coma, over on the mexico 
border." i didn't sit. instead i just bore in, hope to stare him 
down, but his eyes had grown distant, that little trick he had of 
alternate between intimacy and remoteness. again it remind me of 
that first morning we'd met, look out over the bluff of the hudson. 

"if you'll let me, i'd like to try and tell you something of the 
circumstances surrounding that tragedy." he was gaze off in the 
direction the women had gone. "you see, when sarah first appear at 
quetzal manor in new york, she was a very trouble young woman. she 
declared she was a person of pure spirit and she want to have a baby 
without so much as touching a man, some procedure that would produce a 
divine child create of cosmic energy." 

cosmic energy. i had a flashback, hearing the words, to the time when 
she'd just turn six and we'd been sent by my mother to the hayloft to 
track down nest secrete there by rogue chicken hens. when we came 
across a cache of eggs, she ask if baby chick came out of them. i 
assured her they did, and then she ask if human baby came from egg 
too. my biology was pretty thin, but i told her i supposed they did, 
sort of, but then the egg were probably hatched, or something, before 
baby were born. she thought about that a moment, scrunch up her 
face, then declared "no!" and bitter began smashing the eggs. baby 
and all living things came from another world, she declared, a special 
place we could not see. they came directly from god. . . . 

that was why she would seek out someone like alex goddard. for her, he 
must have seem a messenger of the unseen. who better to create a 
child for her? the ironic part was, i'd found him for almost the same 
reason, seek a miracle when all else had failed. were sarah and i 
even more alike than i'd realized? 

"so i began try to work with her." he was turning back to me. "but 
then i discover she'd been born with an abnormal of the uterus. it 
has a medical name, but suffice to say it's very rare, and afflict 
only about one woman in twenty thousand. even after my diagnosis, 
though, she refuse to give up. she was a person of enormous tenacity." 

god, i thought. why didn't she come home to us, to lou 

and me? we love her. i felt my guilt go out to her all over again. 

"she next declared she want to come here to _baalum_, to the place of 
miracles. i told her that, yes, miracle can sometimes transpire here, 
but only at a great price. we would need to have an agreement and she 
would have to keep it no matter what." 

"what do you mean, an agree--?" 

"truthfully, though," he went on, ignore me, "i immediately regret 
the offer, since i realize she was far too unstable for this . . . 
environment. finally i forbade her to come, but just before my next 
schedule trip she found out and book herself on the same flight. 
there was literally nothing i could do to stop her." 

"she put nino del mundo on her landing card." i was grow sick to my 
stomach at the rehearse way he was recount her story. "that's this 
place, right? _baalum_." 

"my clinic here is known by that name. the village itself is call 
baalum." he was easily meeting my eye, holding his own in our battle of 
wills. "sarah was, i have to say, a very impressionable young person. 
once here, she forgot all about her purpose for coming. she should have 
stay up the hill there"--he was point off to the south--"where i 
could care for her, but instead she move down here, into the 
compounds. then she discover a hallucinogenic substance they have 
here, began use it heavily, and i think it tip her into a form of 
dementia." 

so, she was do drugs, something i'd always secret feared. well, 
maybe she was still have flashback of some kind; maybe that 
explain why she was off in another world when she came out of her 
coma. 

"what . . . kind of 'hallucinogenic substance'?" 

he sigh then shrug and answered. "here in the rain forest there's 
an ugly three-pound toad the _bufo marinus_--you'll see them around, 
near sunset--that has gland down its back that excrete a milky white 
poison." 

i knew about them. they were migrate north now, even into florida. 
they were huge and look like jabba the hutt in star wars. i hate 
toad of all varieties, but the thought of those monster made me 
shudder. 

"my god, isn't their toxin lethal?" was sarah try to destroy 
herself? was that why her mind was so blitzed? "i've heard--" 

"yes, it can kill you, but it can also--if process correctly, with 
ferment honey--give you truly supernatural visions. the classical 
maya use it for ceremonial purposes. i'd manage to reconstruct how 
they prepared it, and--something i now deep regret--i show the 
shaman here how to replicate the procedure. at the time it was just a 
minor part of my research into traditional pharmacology, but she heard 
about it and persuade them to give her a vial. then more and more." 

that did sound like sarah. always out on the edge, test new 
realities. but then i thought a moment about what he'd actually said. 
some of the people here in his "place of miracles" were do heavy 
drugs, and she'd got caught up in it. 

"but why didn't you stop her?" you unfeeling bastard. 

"i tried, believe me. but i'm afraid she was far past listen to me. 
by then she was learning the kekchi maya dialect, becoming total 
immerse in their world. she began have episode of complete 
non-rationality, and then one day she told the women in her compound 
she was go over to palenque, the maya ruins in mexico. it's where 
the classical maya held their last kingship ceremony. before anyone 
realize she was serious, she stole one of their _cayucos_, their 
mahogany dugout canoes, and head down the rio tigre." his eyes had 
turn completely dark, the way he use to blank them out. "she just 
went missing. everyone here was devastated. we all love her." 

i stood there weigh his story. it didn't ring true. i supposed she 
was capable of something that crazy, but would she have actually done 
it? i didn't think so. 

then i remember something else he'd said. 

"you said you propose an 'agreement.' what was that about?" 

he stare at me. "it's nothing that need concern us. suffice to say i 
kept my part. anyway, it's over and past now." 

why wouldn't he tell me? did she make some bargain with the devil? 

"but regarding sarah," he went on, "i only just learned she'd been 
found and brought to new york in a coma. wanting to do what i could, i 
immediately call the hospital and, out of professional courtesy, they 
told me she'd shown early stage of coming out of it, but she appear 
to be hallucinating. it was exactly what i'd feared. . . ." his voice 
trail off. "i hope i did the right thing, but when i learned she'd 
been released, i arrange for her to be brought back here, where 
perhaps i can do something for her." 

"what?" 

"in rare cases, the hallucinogen she took permanent alter critical 
synapse in the brain. i'm fearful she may have abuse it to the extent 
something like that could have occurred. no one in the u.s. would have 
the slightest idea what to do, but i think i may know of an herbal 
antidote they turn to in ancient times that can repair at least part 
of the damage. i also knew that get her back here through normal 
channel would be impossible." 

"so you had colonel ramo and a bunch of his guatemala thug just 
break in and take her?" i didn't know which part of the story 
horrified, and angered, me the most. 

"i have the misfortune to know him reasonably well, and 

i explain it was very important to me, and he agree to assist. i 
honestly didn't know where else to turn. i understand there may have 
been some violence, for which i apologize, but these people have their 
own way of do things." he rose and came over and put his hand on my 
shoulder. "i hope you'll understand." 

the son of a bitch was coming on oily and contrite, when he'd just 
subcontract an outright kidnapping. i want to kill him. 

finally i walk away, try to get a grip on my anger. 

"you know, that bastard also broke into my apartment and stole a reel 
of a picture i'm shooting." i turn back. "i've also got a strong 
feeling he's the one who just threaten one of the women i filmed." 

"well, if that happened, then let me say welcome to the paranoid 
harassment of the guatemala high command." he sigh against the 
morning sound of bird chirp all around us. "unfortunately, i gather 
they've assume you're document the operation of children of light 
in some way, do a movie." his eyes drift off into space, as though 
seek a refuge. "you see, my project up here in the peten is to carry 
out pharmaceutical research with as few distraction as possible. but 
in guatemala city, i have what is, in effect, a hospice for girl in 
trouble--which is also call niiio del mundo, by the way--that's 
connected with my u.s. adoption service, children of light. however, 
any time niiio del mundo take in an orphan or abandoned infant and 
try to provide it with a loving home through adoption in the states, 
the government here always threaten to hold up the paperwork if i 
don't give a bribe, what they call an 'expediting fee.' so if you were 
to probe too deep . . . let me just say it's not something they'd 
care to see lead off 60 minutes." 

it sound like more bs, but i couldn't prove that. yet. 

"well, why don't you just clear that up, and then i'll take sarah and--" 

"but i've only now initiate her treatment. surely you want to give it 
a chance." 

i look out at the rain forest. this was the place she'd come to once, 
and--though i'd never admit it to alex goddard--it was the place she'd 
announce she want to return to. but something devastating had 
happen to her mind here. what should i do? 

the fact was, i didn't trust alex goddard any farther than i could 
throw him. i had to get sarah and get us both out of here as soon as 
possible, though that meant i'd have to neutralize him and the army, 
and then use my limited america dollar to try to buy our way back to 
guatemala city. 

"but come." he turn his gaze toward the south. "let me show you the 
thing i'm proudest of here. it's just up there." he was point toward 
a dense section of the rain forest, in the opposite direction from the 
river and up a steep incline. 

i couldn't see anything but trees, but then i still had the feeling i'd 
step through the look glass and found sarah trap there. the 
next thing i knew, we were on an uphill forest trail, head due south. 

"i think it's time you told me what's go on back there in the 
village," i said. what was it about this place that had seize such a 
claim on sarah's mind? 

"_baalum_ is difficult to explain to someone encounter it for the 
first time." he paused. "much of it is so--" 

"i think i can handle it." 

"you have every right to know, but i don't really know where to start." 

"how about the beginning?" why was he being so ambiguous? 

"very well." he was taking out a pair of gray sunglasses, 

as though to gain time. "it actually go back about ten years ago, 
when i was prospect for rainforest plant up here in the peten and 
accidental stumble across this isolated village, which clearly had 
been here since classical times. i immediately notice a huge mound of 
dirt everybody said was haunt by 'the old ones,' and i knew right 
away it had to be a bury pyramid. they're more common down here than 
you'd think. so i struck a bargain with the village elder and acquire 
the site. but after i unearth it and began the restoration, i became 
inspired with a vision. one day i found myself offering to restore 
anything else they could find--which eventually included, by the way, a 
magnificent old steam bath--in exchange for which they would help me by 
undertaking a grand experiment, a return to their traditional way of 
life." 

"so you deliberate closed them off to the modern world?" it told me 
alex goddard could control a mayan village just as he control 
everything else he touched. it also confirmed he had a weakness for the 
grandiose gesture. would a time come when i could exploit that? 

"i told them that together we would try to recreate the time of their 
glory, and perhaps in so do we could also rediscover its long-lost 
spirit, and wisdom. on the practical side, they would help me by 
bring me the rare plant i need to try and rediscover the lost 
native america pharmacologies, and in return i would build them a 
clinic where family can come for modern pediatric and public-health 
services. so _baalum _became a project we share together. i call it a 
miracle." 

that still didn't begin to explain why it felt so eerie. something else 
was go on just under the surface. what was he really do here? 

then the path uphill abrupt open onto a clearing in which sat a 
large two-story building, its color a dazzle white, most likely 
plaster over cinder block, with a thatch roof and a wide, ornate 
mahogany door at the front. the building was nestle in a grove of 
tree whose vine and tendril had embrace it so thoroughly, there was 
no telling how far it extend back into the forest. there also was a 
parking lot, paved and fed by a well-maintained gravel road leading 
south. 

seeing it, i felt an immediate wave of relief. even better, the lot 
itself contained half-a-dozen well-worn pickup trucks, while sunburn 
maya men were lounge in the shade of a nearby tree and smoking 
cigarettes. they were not from baalum. they wore machine-made clothes 
and they were speak spanish, unlike the men in loincloth down in 
the village. 

yes! that's how i can get us out of here. a few dollar . . . 

park there also was a tan humvee, the ultimate all-road vehicle, 
which i assume belong to alex goddard. maybe i should just try to 
steal it. 

as we pass through the door and into the vestibule of the building, i 
glimpse a cluster of maya women and children crowded into a 
brilliant lit reception area. goddard smile and wave at them, and 
several nod back, timorous and with enormous reverence. they were 
being attend by a dark-eyed, attractive maya woman in a blue 
uniform--the name lettered on her blouse was marcelina--who was holding 
a tray of vial and hypodermic needles. she was pure _indigena_, all of 
five feet tall, with broad cheekbone and deep-set penetrating eyes. 
unlike the other women in the room, however, there was no air of 
resignation about her. she was full of authority, a palpable inner fire. 

"one of my most successful program here"--he nod a greeting to 
her--"is to provide free vaccination and general health resources for 
the village in this part of the peten department." 

"i thought usaid already had public-health project in guatemala." the 
sight deep depressed me. they all look so poignant, the women with 
their shabby _huipils_ and line faces, the children even more 
disheartening, sad waif with runny nose and watery eyes. 

which confirmed again that they'd come in the pickup park outside, 
driven here by the men. 

i had six hundred cash in dollars. i could just buy one of those 
worn-out junk for that. 

alex goddard glance around, as though reluctant to respond in the 
presence of all the maya. 

"you saw those 'security guards' down there just now. they're nothing 
but boys with guns, 'recruits' kidnap by the government on market 
day and pressed into the army. they're all around here. the powers that 
be in guatemala city are very threaten by what i'm achieving, so 
they've got these army kid hanging around, keeping an eye on me. they 
also hate the fact i can provide health service better than they can. 
but to answer your question, most of the aid money get soaked up by 
the bureaucracy in guatemala city, so the people up here have learned 
to rely on me. the army, however, despise me and everything i'm doing." 

what a load of bs. you just admitted you had an inside track with 
colonel alvino ramos. anybody can see children of light or nino del 
mundo, or whatever the hell other alias you use, is thick as thief 
with the guatemala armed forces. don't insult my intelligence. it just 
make me furious. 

i turn to marcelina. she'd begun passing out hard-sugar candy to 
the mesmerize children, showing them how to remove the cellophane 
before putt them into their mouths. though she was pure maya, she 
look educated. i instinctive like her. maybe she could tell me 
what was really go on here. 

"do you speak english?" 

"yes." she was gaze at me with a blend of curiosity and concern. 
"if--" 

"i've got a procedure schedule shortly," goddard interjected, urge 
me on down the tile hallway. "but i need to take a moment and 
recharge. come with me and we can talk some more." 

near the end of the hall, we enter a spacious, country-style kitchen. 
he walk over and open the refrigerator. 

"care for a little something to eat?" he look back, speckle white 
hair swinging across his shoulder as his ponytail came loose. "i had 
marcelina whip up some gazpacho last night and i see there's some left. 
it's my own secret recipe, special herb from around here. it's good 
and good for you." 

"i'm not hungry." it wasn't true. i was grow ravenous. but i was 
repress the feeling because of everything else that was go on. 
his "village" was holding back its secrets, and now his clinic of 
"miracles" also felt suspicious wrong. i'd seen plenty of rural 
public-health operation in develop countries, and this setup was 
far too big and fancy. the whole thing didn't begin to compute. 

"as you like." he gave an absent shrug. 

i look around and notice that just off the kitchen was another 
space, which was, i realized, his private dine room. there was a 
rustic table in the center that look like it had been carve from the 
trunk of a large cebia tree. i walk in, and moments later he follow 
carry a tray with two calabash bowls of gazpacho and some crusty 
bread. 

"in case you change your mind and decide to join me." he placed a bowl 
opposite where he was plan to sit. "like i said, there're unusual 
herb around here with flavor you've never dream of." 

he began eating, while behind him i glimpse marcelina moving down the 
hall, carry more tray of vaccine and head out toward the 
vestibule again. i had to find a way to talk to her. 

as i settled into the rickety chair that face my plate, i glance down 
and saw a red lumpy mixture with a spray of indefinable green speck 
across the top like a scatter of jungle stars. no way. 

when i look up again, he was swab his lip with a white napkin, 
his penetrating eyes bore in. 

"now," he said, "it's time we start concentrate on you. got you 
go with your program." 




chapter twenty-two 


"my program?" i stare back at him, feeling a jolt. with my thought 
completely focus on sarah, the last thing on my mind was my own baby. 

"now that you're here"--he smiled--"there's no reason we shouldn't 
proceed. this is, after all, a place of miracles." 

right. you let sarah destroy her mind and now you want me to . . . 

don't even think about it. 

"i have to tell you, i'm not overly impress thus far with your 
'program,' " i said. "first i pass out in your clinic, and then my 
doctor in new york told me those drug ramala gave me are highly 
illegal, and for good reason." 

"what is 'legal' is more often than not the judgment of medical 
reactionaries." he dismiss the issue with a wave of his hand. "my 
work has move far beyond anything the fda has ever dream of." then 
his look turn grave. "i hope you'll give me a chance to try to help 
you. i've been give your case a lot of thought since our first 
examination, about what we should do. but first let me ask you . . . do 
you have a partner who could come here soon?" 

okay, maybe the thing to do was appear to play along for a while, move 
under his radar, and then get sarah and split. 

"it's a possibility." 

he smile again. "excellent. if this person can come here 

to the clinic for a . . . deposit, then we could put you on a 
fast-track schedule." 

"one thing at a time. first i'd like to know exactly what it is you 
have in mind." would his "program" include string me out on the toad 
drug, the way he'd done with sarah? 

"of course." he lean forward in his chair. "i believe that, given 
your history, an in-vitro procedure would have the highest chance of 
success. you undoubted know how it works. we remove a number of egg 
by aspiration and grade them for maturity and viability, after which we 
fertilize them to begin embryo growing. then we pick the most 
promising for implantation." 

"in vitro is invasion and dangerous and there's a lot that can go 
wrong." i genuine hate the idea. 

"to some extent." he examine his watch for a moment, then look up. 
"but let me just say this. since any reproductive therapy, particularly 
in vitro, is strong dependent on the factor of timing, i've develop 
experimental compound down here that can regulate egg maturity very 
precisely. it minimize a lot of uncertainties, which is why we're so 
lucky you're . . ." he paused. "look, the first thing we need to do is 
put you on a strict regimen of diet and spiritual discipline, use my 
system for regulate your chi, your energy flows. then, if you respond 
we can start thinking about the procedure. and should you eventually 
decide you want to go ahead and you can have your partner come here, we 
could possibly have everything done in just a few days." 

"well, you can forget about me taking any 'experimental compounds.' " 
how long could i stall him? 

"morgan, there's more to this." his look grew pained. "it's awkward to 
bring it up, but your presence here create no small difficulty for me. 
i told you certain people in the military high command have concern 
about the film you're making. and then the next thing they know, you 
show up here. it's just go to heighten their paranoia. but if i can 
convince them you're here for fertility treatment . . . in any case, 
it's important that nothing you, or i, do is at odds with that 
presumption. i hope it's true, but even if you chose to forgo it, i 
still need to put you on my normal regimen. you understand." 

that's baloney. somebody had me brought to _baalum_. whoever did it 
know full well why i'm here. the problem is, i still don't know what 
they really want. 

"well, you can say i've come to take sarah home," i told him. "that 
seem reason enough." 

"the other story is simple to explain." he took a last bite of 
gazpacho, then rest his pewter spoon on the table. "take my word for 
it." 

"and what if i don't choose to go along with this charade?" 

"we would both be in jeopardy. they're entire capable of . . . things 
i'd rather not have to elaborate on." 

i sat there, feeling a chill envelop the room. how was i go to get 
out of this place? 

"by the way, a while ago sarah mention something about a 'ceremony.' 
what's that--?" 

"it's a special time here." his gaze shift to the ceiling. "in fact, 
it's supposed to take place in three days, but the army has informed me 
it has to be two days from now. that's the day they rotate the troops 
here, so there'll be double strength." 

"but why do they need--" 

"things can get a bit frenzied." he smiled, though he seem to be 
embarrassed. "however, the people will love the fact you're here to 
share it with them." 

did he say "frenzied"? my mind immediately flash on the aztec ritual 
of rip out beating hearts. but the maya didn't go to that extreme, 
at least so far as i knew. once again, though, i had the feeling i was 
only hearing what he want me to know, not the whole truth. it felt 
like a chess game where i didn't know the location of all the pieces or 
how they could move. 

"tell you what." he was get up, turning toward the hall. "why don't 
you let me show you around the clinic? in fact, i'm schedule to 
perform an in vitro this morning for a childless couple here. you're 
free to see it. perhaps that could help you make your own decision." 

"well . . . do you have a phone? i need to make some calls." would he 
let me call out? that would be a first test of what his intentions 
were. it was all get so insidious. i had sarah to worry about, and 
the army, and now some kind of "ceremony" that he'd manage to stay 
canny vague about. i only knew i want the whole world to know where 
i was. 

"of course," he said. "you're welcome to use my office." he was 
point down the hall. "it's right this way." 

yes! maybe i'm not completely his prisoner yet. i still have 
privileges. but i'd damn well better use them while i can. 

i walk out and felt a breeze, and then i studied the far end of the 
hallway, at the opposite end from the entrance, and notice huge 
slat windows. as we walk in their direction, i realize there was 
a stairway on one side, at the end of the hall, leading up to the 
second story of the building. 

"what's up there?" 

"hygenic nursery rooms." he glance at the stairs. "unlike u.s. 
practice, new mother here aren't sent home after a day or two. women 
and their newborn are encourage to stay here at the clinic for at 
least a week. it's actually very much a part of their tradition, a 
period of bonding. you're welcome to visit with them later if you like." 

i intended to. in fact, i found myself look around and try to 
memorize everything about the place. a two-story building, a marble 
stair, a nursery upstairs, downstairs rooms along either side of the 
hallway (what was in them?), and an office i was about to see. could 
the clinic be lock down? what were the escape routes? how close was 
the army watching? the time would come, i was sure, when i'd need every 
scrap of intelligence i could collect. 

when we reach the end of the hall, the fresh cool wind still blow 
against my face, he stop in front of a large, ornate wooden door 
with a brass knob in the very center. there was no sign of a lock, just 
a sense of great gravity about its purpose. 

"the phone's in here." he pushed the door and it slow swung inward on 
hinge that must have require ball bearings. 

it was indeed an office, dim light by the moving screen-savers of 
two computers, each on a separate desk. he flick on the overhead 
lights and i notice that one computer was hooked to a fax machine, the 
other to a separate printer. an impressive assembly of data-management 
technology for out here in the rain forest. 

then i focus on the central desk, on which sat an open, 
briefcase-looking box contain a mini-console label magellan world 
phone. a small satellite dish was bolt down next to it. 

"it uplink to the inmarsat series 3 geostationary satellites." he 
indicate the dish. "but it works like a regular phone. the 
international code all apply." then he turn to leave. "i should be 
ready for the procedure in a few minutes." 

i picked up the handset and flick it on. three green diode flashed, 
then two yellow ones, after which a white light came on and i heard a 
continuous hum, a dial tone. 

hooray. but was his satellite phone tapped? why would he let me just 
call out? was this a feint in our game of cat-and-mouse, just to lull 
me into believe everything here was safe and benign? remember 
sarah's drug experience, i already knew that couldn't be true. for now, 
though, i had to get an sos out while i had the chance. 

i'd long since memorize the number of steve's hotel in belize city, 
and if i could reach him, he could go the embassy in guatemala city and 
. . . i wasn't sure what. i still hope to get out of here on my own, 
but if that fail . . . maybe some of those sturdy marine . . . 

when i dial the belize number, however, the phone just rang and rang. 

come on. somebody please pick up. 

then they did. thank goodness. but when i ask for steve-- 

"so sorry, mon," came the proud caribbean voice, "but mr. abrams check 
out monday. early in the morning." 

"right, i know that. but he came back last night, didn't he?" 

"no, mon. he say he be coming back, to hold his room, but--" 

"he didn't come back?" i felt my palm go icy. who was go to know 
where sarah and i were? "what do you mean?" 

"he not coming back here, mon." the man pause and mumble something to 
another clerk, then came back on. "nobody seen him since. you want 
leave a message, that's okay. but i don't know when--" 

"no." i didn't know what to say. the implication was only gradual 
sink in. "no message. thanks anyway. i'll try back later." 

"any time, mon. no problem." 

i hung up, try to stay calm. steve, where are you? 

okay, i told myself, you don't actually know something's wrong. it 
could be anything. still, it was very worrying. steve, my one and only 
. . . 

i was staring at the phone, wonder what my next move should be. 
whatever else, i've got to try to reach lou, tell him i've found sarah. 
but then what? he certainly wasn't go to be any help in get us 
out. if he blunder his way down here, there was a real chance he'd 
misread the delicacy of the situation and end up get us all 
"disappeared" by the army. but still, i had to tell him about her. 

i picked up the handset again, key in the u.s. country code, and 
try the number for his place in soho. he'd said he was go to be 
release from st. vincent's today, so maybe he was home by now. 

the familiar ring jangle half a dozen times and then . . . 

"crenshaw residence." it was the ireland tone of mrs. reilly, sarah's 
day nurse. hallelujah. i guess she was there now taking care of lou. 

"uh, this is morgan james. mr. crenshaw's niece. remember? i came by. 
is he home yet? i need to talk to him." 

"he's resting, dear. i was just about to go out and get some things, 
milk and soup and the like." 

"so . . . dare i ask? how is he?" 

"he's weak, but i think he's go to be fine. if people will just let 
him be." 

"look, i hate to bother him, but it's really an emergency. i'm calling 
from guatemala." 

"oh. i truly don't know if he's awake, dear. he was nap a while 
ago." 

"could you . . . could you go and see? please. and take the phone?" 

"just a minute." she sound reluctant, but i could hear her movements 
as she shuffle across the loft. i listened, wonder how long alex 
goddard was go to be away, and then a moment later . . . 

"yeah." there was a rustle as lou got a grip on his cordless. "morgan, 
is that you? where the hell are you now?" 

it took me a second to even find my voice, i was so thrill to hear 
him. he sound just like always. 

"hey, how's it going, champ?" i said. come on, lou. get well. fight. 

"i start have these migraines, but they gave me some medicine--" 

"listen." i cut him off, and immediately felt guilty i'd been so 
impatient. "i'm up in northern guatemala and i've found sarah." 

"oh, my god." that was follow by a long silence, probably an 
emotional meltdown. "is she all right?" 

what was i go to say? that she'd been brainwash or worse by alex 
goddard? that we were both in his clutches, cut off from the world, and 
in deep, deep trouble? 

"she's able to stand," i said. 

i don't remember what white lie i eventually manage to tell him. i 
think it was something like, "she's being treat for a post-coma 
syndrome by a medical specialist. i've found out that when she was in 
guatemala before, she was given some very bad drugs, and someone here 
who know about them is try to reverse some of the damage." 

"alex goddard, right?" there was no bs-ing lou for very long. "that 
bastard." 

"lou, i'm go to get her out of here and back home as soon as 
possible. everything's go to be all right. don't worry. it's really 
too complicated to try and explain over the phone." 

"yeah, well, i'm coming. soon as i'm up. i'm gonna take that son of a 
bitch by the--" 

"don't. don't you go anywhere. i'm handle it, okay?" 

i heard him grunt, whether from pain or frustration i couldn't be sure. 
"lou, listen, i'm go to try and phone you every day. if i miss a 
day, then you should call the embassy down here. tell them you're fbi. 
that might get their attention. the place where i am, where sarah is, 
is name baalum. it's a . . . kind of village. in the northern peten 
department. i don't know if the u.s. has any clout up here, but that's 
where they should come looking." 

i got him to write it down, and then ease him off the line as gently 
as i could and hung up. i would have love for him to be here, but i 
want to try to get sarah out by stealth if i could. and stealth was 
scarcely lou's style. 

my call were one for two, and there still wasn't anybody to help me. 
the time had come to try david. i was have the glimmerings of a new 
strategy. 

it was lunchtime in new york, but on wednesday he usually just had a 
sandwich at his desk. maybe i could catch him. 

"hello," declared the britain female voice he'd put on his machine, 
hope it would sound like he had a classy secretary. "you've reach 
the office of david roth, president of applecore productions. we're 
sorry mr. roth is not available at this time to--" 

"david," i bark into the phone. "if you're there, pick up. this is 
morgan. i've got to talk to you." 

while the announcement kept running, noise erupt outside in the 
hall, voice and a click sound, as though something was being roll 
along the tile floor. shit. was alex goddard about to walk in? my mouth 
went dry. come on, david, i know you're there, hiding--variety with a 
tuna salad on rye, extra pickle. dr. brown's cel-ray soda. 

"david damnit, pick up." i said it quiet this time, but i could feel 
my heart pounding. "this is an emergency." 

"morgy, don't!" he yell as i heard the receiver being 

lifted. "jesus, i just walk in from the deli. listen, thank god it's 
you. drop whatever the hell you're not do and get your butt in here. 
jerry rein called, you know, the ore distribution deal--and he 
wants a rough cut of _baby love_ yesterday so he can pitch it to the 
suit on the fifth floor. we could be staring at financial success 
here. i hope you can handle the vulgarity of that." 

"david, you're not go to believe where i am," i began, working out 
my game plan as i went along, try to sound cool and control my 
racing pulse. "i'm in northern guatemala, at a place that would make a 
terrific feature. it's like a maya theme park, deep in the rain forest. 
but it's real. i want you to contact the embassy and get them to grease 
the way for my crew to come here. this is too good to pass up." i 
thought about the costs and then added, "at least one camera and sound." 

one sure way to get sarah out was to blow the place open to the world. 

"what's . . . where are you again?" 

i gave him a glowing trailer of the williamsburg-like quality of 
baalum--a beautiful, exciting recreation of times gone by that 
out-disneyed disney. the cable channel would be bidding for the 
footage. 

"hey, look, all things in time." he wasn't buying. "i'm talk an 
actual deal here. you know, money? fuck the jungle wonderland. you've 
got exactly one more day down there on the tarzan set, or wherever the 
hell it is, and then i'm gonna start finish final cut on this damn 
picture myself. don't make me have to do that, morgy. this is not a 
drill. nicky russo came by again yesterday. he's fully prepared to call 
our note and impound your original negative. it's here, under lock and 
key, but we've got to get this project in the can and sold." 

"you touch a frame of my movie and i won't be responsible for my 
actions." god, he was missing my sos. "david do one thing for me, 
please. i can't tell you how important it is. i haven't explain 
everything. this situation is . . . it's very threatening. i need you 
to at least call the embassy down here and see if they'll send 
somebody. the army's all over the place and--" 

a loud noise intervene follow by complete, absolute silence. the 
diode on the panel all began flash yellow. 

"shit!" had alex goddard been listen in and decided to cut me off 
before i could get word to the embassy? 

i slam the box and went for the usual maneuver: i cut the connection 
and try again, but nothing. again, and still nothing. 

my hand were trembling. i'd just lost contact with the outside world. 
i was completely isolated in the middle of nowhere. 

how convenient. alex goddard let me tell a couple of people i was 
physically okay, and then he block the line. 

i exhale settled into the pad chair next to the computers, and 
try to think. david, david why wouldn't you listen? he was so excited 
he'd completely ignore my distress signal. nobody was go to come 
and help me get out of here. 

i gaze around the room, wonder what to do next. was there another 
phone, a radio, a box of flares, for godsake? 

that was when i spotted the outline of another door--why hadn't i 
notice it sooner?--this one steel, there on the left. alex goddard 
might walk in any second now, but i had to try to learn everything i 
could as fast as i could. what was go on besides what was go on? 

alert for any new sound from outside, i quick went over and try 
the knob. 

it was lock tight. 

figured. now i really want to know what was in there. 

when i glance around the office, i notice a ring of key on the desk. 
could he have forgotten them? 

more important, would i blow everything if he caught me snooping? in 
spite of his attempt at a cool veneer, he might go ballistic. 

i made a snap decision. take the chance and give them a try. 

my hand were so moist i had trouble holding the slippery keys, but 
finally i manage to shove in the first one. it went in, but nothing 
would turn. 

come on. i manage to wiggle the next one in, my hand tremble now, 
but again the knob wouldn't budge. footstep outside march up to the 
door and i stop breathing, but then they move on. 

hurry. i was rapid lose hope when the fifth one slip in and the 
knob turned. yes! 

taking a deep breath and working on a story in case alex goddard walk 
in, i click the lock and ease the door inward just enough to look 
inside. 

hello, what's this? the space was a fully equip medical research 
lab. the lights were off, but like the office, it was illuminate by 
the glow of several crt screen station above a long lab bench. there 
also was a large machine, probably a gas chromatograph, with its own 
screen, flank by row of test tubes. finally, there was a large 
electronic microscope complete with video screen. 

one non-medical thing stood out, though: there in the middle of the 
workbench was a two-foot-high bronze dance shiva preside over 
whatever was go on. it was breath-takingly beautiful. 

so . . . what was the lord of the dance give his blessing to? time to 
try and find out. 

now clank noise were filter in from out in the hall, along with 
the pounding of heavy boots, and my pulse jump again. was the army 
coming to drag me away? 

just go in. do it. 

the crt screen were attach to black metal containers, their door 
closed, that all were connected to a power supply, doubtless to 
maintain some temperature. it look like goddard was incubate 
something in a careful control environment. the whole arrangement 
was very careful organized and laid out. 

finally i notice a row of large steel jugs, six in all, near the back 
and cover with a sheet of black plastic, thin like a wrap. what could 
they be? some kind of special gas for use in the lab? 

voice in spain drift in from the hallway. a woman and a man were 
argue about something. 

okay, get out of here. come back and check this out when nobody's 
around. 

i step back into the office, click off the thumb latch on the door 
so it wouldn't lock, and closed it. i realize i was pour sweat. 

what next? well, see if the phone's working again and try calling the 
camino real and see if steve's come back there for some reason, maybe a 
change in plans. it would be a long shot, but still . . . 

my hand was shake as i open up the phone case. thank god, the 
diode were all quiet. maybe . . . 

the steel door i'd closed only moments before swung open and alex 
goddard walk through. did he realize i'd left it unlocked? how did he 
get in there? was there another door? 

he'd change clothes and was wearing a pale blue surgical gown. i shut 
the phone case, as though just finish with it. could he tell i'd 
turn myself into a nervous wreck? i try to smile and look normal, 
but my shirt was soaking. 

"ah, i see you're finished," he said, not seeming to notice. 

"good. as i said, i've got an in-vitro procedure schedule now for one 
of the couple here in the village. you're welcome to observe. it might 
help you decide what you want to do in your own case." he was moving 
across the room. "you can watch on the closed circuit." 

he reach up and snap on a monitor bolt to the wall in the corner. 

"oh, just one small word of forewarning." he was turning back. "down 
here i've made certain . . . cosmetic change in the procedure to keep 
patients' anxiety level as low as possible. it wouldn't be appropriate 
in your case, but . . . well, you'll see." 

before i had time to wonder what he meant, he disappear back through 
the steel door with a reassure smile. 




chapter twenty-three 


the monitor's picture was in color, but the predominant hue was brown. 
where was this? the or had to be somewhere in the clinic, but still . . 
. 

the space look flawless sterile, obviously an operate theater, 
but it was certainly like none other on earth. the wall were not white 
or pale blue; they had the shade of stone and were decorate with maya 
picture writing and bas-reliefs. it was as though a sacred chapel had 
been convert into a surgery. i guess this was what he meant by 
"cosmetic changes." a door was visible on the right side of the screen, 
and moments later alex goddard strode through, coming in from the 
hallway. 

so, it must be right next door. god, the place look ancient and 
haunted. 

i watch as he walk over to a basin and scrub his hands, then 
don a white surgical mask. next he flip various switch on the 
walls. finally he put on a second mask that glisten like some green 
crystalline material. 

what was that for? then it hit me. a "jade" mask . . . 

that was something sarah had mention in her ramblings. so she must 
have seen this too. which meant. . . not everything she describe was 
just some drug-induced hallucination. the mask part was very real. . . . 

now marcelina was rolling a steel operate table, bearing a 
dark-haired maya woman, through the doorway. the patient look like 
all the other down in baalum, except that she had a strange expression 
on her face. she appear to be tense and very afraid, as her eyes kept 
dart around the room, then to the "jade" mask alex goddard was 
wearing--most likely papier-mache cover with shiny green granules. 

when she was in position, he walk to the corner and flip another 
switch, whereupon there start the deep drone of a chant, probably 
from speaker in the walls, that sound like kekchi maya. 

he bent over her and said something in the same language, after which 
marcelina placed a rubber mask over her nose and mouth. her eyes still 
frightened, the patient utter a few words, perhaps a final prayer, 
then inhale deeply. as her eyelid fluttered, he turn and open 
what appear to be some kind of stone tableau, cover by its own 
bas-relief. it was, i finally realized, merely paint fiberglass--that 
was what the whole room was--and inside were crt monitor design to 
display various vital life functions. as marcelina help him, he began 
attach sensor to the patient's body. 

when the woman's eyes had fully closed, he remove his green mask and 
toss it into a box. 

it's all fake. the room, everything. just like _baalum_. but now he's 
got sarah's mind caught in his thrall. i've got to make her understand 
nothing here is real. 

marcelina was careful watch the screens, her apprehension obvious 
as she fiddle uncertain with the knobs. 

"oxygen steady." her voice was small and uneasy. "ekg stable." 

he immediately strip away the sheet that had been covering the 
patient. beneath it was an open-sided gown colored in brilliant stripe 
of red and blue. he pull it back with absent precision, then turn 
to marcelina. 

"shave her and scrub her." 

with the woman now under sedation, marcelina put on her own surgical 
garb: she pull a blue plastic cap over her hair, then secure a white 
or mask over her face. while she was finish the preparations, he 
turn and walk to the far side of the room, where he abrupt seem 
to disappear through the wall. 

what . . . there must be a panel there, a camouflage door. 

he was gone for a moment, then reappear carry a long metal tube 
that look to be emit white vapor. he next open yet another 
ersatz stone cabinet to reveal a microscope with a crt screen above it. 
he took out three glass ampule from the tube--frozen embryos, 
undoubtedly--and placed them in a container. when he switch on the 
microscope, its crt screen show him whatever he need to know. 
interesting. in surgery, he was cold efficient, no "human touch." 
here he was the "scientist" alex goddard. 

next, marcelina activate an ultrasound scanner and began running the 
wand over the woman's stomach. the screen above the table show her 
uterus and her fallopian tube with flicker clarity. 

he'd been ready the embryos, and now he walk over and careful 
insert a needle into the woman's abdomen--ouch--his eyes on the 
ultrasound scan, which indicate the precise location of the needle's 
tip. 

i watch as the screen show the needle on its way to its 
destination, a thin, hard line amidst the pulse gray mass of her 
uterus. seconds later all three embryo had been implant with such 
flawless precision it was scary. 

did i want to undergo this deep invasion procedure at the hand of 
alex goddard? the very thought left a dull ache in my stomach. 

while marcelina bandage her and began prepare her for return to 
wherever she'd been, he turn off the systems, then closed their 
"stone" cabinets. 

i thought back to some of the "hallucinations" sarah had pour out. 
she'd mention the green mask, and she'd also relive some sinister 
event that seem to her like disappear down a long white tunnel. 
was that her own anesthesia? did he perform an in vitro on her too? 

i jump as i heard the "bump, thump, bump" sound of the operate 
table being roll out of the or and back down the hall. for some 
reason i thought of the sound of fate knock on the door, like death 
coming to take don giovanni. did alex goddard have plan to take me, 
only with drug and medical sleight of hand? it wasn't go to happen. 

i switch off the monitor and turn to stare at the computers. why 
were they here in this "place of miracles"? what did they hold? maybe 
that was where i should be. . . . 

that was the moment when the heavy office door swung open and marcelina 
appeared. 

"your room is ready now." her english was heavy accent but sure. 
"he sent me to show you. and i can wash any of your things if you like." 

my room? whoa! since when had i checked in? 

"marcelina, we need to talk. what happen to sarah the last time she 
was here? was she operate on like that woman just now?" 

i also plan to ask her about all the bizarre trappings surrounding 
the procedure. why was the woman so suck in by his phony mardi gra 
mysticism? had sarah fallen for it too? 

"sara was one of the special ones. you are surely blessed too. you 
resemble her a lot." she look at me, affection in her dark eyes, then 
turn and head out the door. "but come, let me take you up." 

of course i resemble her; she was my cousin. but so what? i didn't 
like the odd way she'd said it. and what about my question? 

watch her walk away, clearly nervous, i realize this was the moment 
i'd been dreading--when i had to make a decision about how far to play 
along with alex goddard. steve couldn't be reached, yet, but i still 
might be able to handle the situation on my own. the first thing to do 
was to get down to sarah and talk some sense into her. then i had to 
arrange for a way to get us both out. 

so . . . probably the best way to accomplish that was to go along with 
my own medical charade for a few more hours, to give me time to scout 
the scene and come up with a plan. a room would be a base to operate 
from. 

still, i was feeling plenty of trepidation as we ascend the marble 
steps to the second floor, which had a long, carpet hallway with 
door along each side. then, when we start down the hall, i caught 
the sound of a baby crying. 

"what's this floor for?" i remember alex goddard had claim it was 
to provide a postpartum bond period, but i want to confirm that 
with my own eyes. 

"this is the recovery ward and nursery. here, let me show you." she 
pause and pushed open the door nearest us. i look in to see a mayan 
woman rest on a high hospital bed and wearing a white shift, with an 
ornate wicker cradle, wide and deep, next to her. 

marcelina smile and said something to her that sound like an apology 
for the intrusion. the room was lit only by candles, but i did make out 
how oddly the woman stare at me, as though she was seeing a spirit. 
why was that? because i was a _gringa _here in the middle of the 
forest? but it seem something more. 

"the birth of a child is a sacred thing for us." marcelina was 
discreet close the door again. "when a woman carry a child she 
will take walk to the _milpas_, to the river, to the orchards, just so 
her little one can be in its world. then, after her baby is born, our 
tradition hold that she should be alone with it for a week and a day. 
so their life's breath can become one." 

i could sense her heart was deep entwine with the people here at 
baalum. 

"marcelina, how long have--?" 

"well, what do you think?" said a voice. i look around to see alex 
goddard coming up the stairs behind us. and my anger well up again. 
everything about him was just too . . . manipulating. 

he'd change back to his black sweatshirt and jeans and was carry a 
tray. the costume event was over. in an instant marcelina slip 
quiet around him and head back down the stairs, almost like a 
rabbit startle by a fox. he smile and move past me. 

"all those trappings just now, the fake green mask." i decided to 
challenge him head-on. start force him to show his hand. "what's--?" 

"merely a little harmless theater." he look back. "the forest maya 
like to think they're being minister to by a shaman." then he 
indicate i should follow him. "by the way, in case you do get hungry, 
i brought you something you can have in your room if you like. then you 
can make yourself at home and rest a bit." 

hold on. i was being given the illusion of freedom, but in reality i 
was nothing more than his prisoner. 

"that room next to your office. the steel door. what's in--?" 

"that's the heart of _baalum_." pride in his voice. "the real reason 
i'm here." 

"you mean drug research?" 

he nodded. "did you know the central america rain forest easily 
contain a hundred thousand plant species? over half of all 
pharmaceutical drug are derive from plants, yet less than one percent 
of those here have been test for pharmacology potential. still, 
the old shaman and midwife all know of herb they claim can cure 
everything from menstrual cramps to cancer." he smiled. "they also know 
which one have powerful contraceptive properties, which is 
particularly helpful in my primary study, fertility and fetal 
viability. i take the specimen they bring and perform a rough 
screening in the lab to determine if they're actually pharmacology 
active. if they do test positive, i then examine their effect on the 
blastocyst, the early form of embryonic cell form just after 
fertilization, to see whether they affect cell division and viable 
and . . . the miscarry rate here is very low, so some of these 
plant . . ." his voice trail off as he pushed open the door of a 
suite at the end of the hall. it had a stone floor, a simple bed, and 
through the slat window the light of midday filter through, along 
with the birdcall of the rain forest. any other time and place, i'd 
have felt like i was stay at a rustic nature retreat. 

but this wasn't some other time and place. and what about steve? where 
was he? maybe he was somewhere worse. thinking about him, i was 
startle to hear myself say . . . 

"incidentally, i found out the man i've been try to have a baby with 
didn't show up at his hotel in belize last night. he was driving there 
from guatemala city. i'm very worried. i keep hearing about how people 
get 'disappeared' in this country. he's--" 

"could his name be steve abrams?" goddard turn back, still holding 
the tray. 

it was a moment that stop my heart. for a second i wasn't even able 
to speak. 

"how . . . did you know?" i finally manage to say. "i never 
mentioned--" 

"that's the name they gave me. i received a call this morning from 
guatemala city. from colonel ramos's office, in fact. as you might 
suppose, he's well aware you're here, and he said you were seen dine 
night before last at a downtown restaurant with a man by that name. 
they think he's in the country because of you, and they're try to 
locate him." 

i felt the life go entire out of me. my god what was go on? steve 
was now the subject of a manhunt in a police state. did he even know? 

"i told them you were here for purely medical reasons." he sigh with 
frustration. "and that they were being irrational paranoid but . . ." 

"so they don't actually know where he is, right?" i was still try to 
breathe. 

"as of this morning. if they did they wouldn't have call up here." he 
walk over and set the tray down on a rustic table next to the bed. "i 
wouldn't worry too much about it. he's committed no crime. they just 
want to make sure you realize your presence has not gone unnoticed." 

dear god. what had i drag steve into? if they found him, what would 
they do? i could only pray he was deft enough to elude them. if anybody 
could . . . 

then i look at the tray. an empty syringe was there. also, there was 
a large bowl contain some kind of soup. i was finally grow 
ravenous, but still . . . 

"what's this for?" i indicate the syringe. 

"i just need to take a little blood for some tests. don't worry, it 
won't hurt a bit." 

hold on. how far do i have to play along to stay in his chess game? 

then i glance down again at the tray. "and what's in that bowl?" 

"right now diet is crucial, so i've had marcelina prepare you a healthy 
broth of soy extract and buckwheat and rainforest herb that--" 

"what kind of rainforest herb exactly?" i was starving, but no way in 
hell-- 

"medicinal ones. part of your program of wholeness." he turned, with 
that faraway look of his, and open the window slats. beyond them i 
could see foliage, now alive with flock of multicolore birds. the 
forest was in full cry. "you know, so many drug are wait to be 
discover up here." he was gaze out. "beyond this window is a giant 
pharmacy, but if it go like the rest of the peten, it'll soon be 
bulldoze to make way for more cattle ranches." 

he came back and picked up the syringe. that was when i notice it 
didn't seem to be entire empty. it appear to contain trace of a 
yellow substance, though maybe i was imagining. . . . 

"look, about the blood test. i don't think--" 

"consider it a free medical screening." he firm grip my arm as he 
plunge the needle into a vein. seconds later he was cap off the 
syringe, red with my blood. "i'm running a batch of test this 
afternoon, so one more sample won't make any difference." 

while he swab my arm with alcohol, i look down again at the bowl 
of broth he'd brought. forget about it. i'd find something in the 
kitchen later. 

"i want to go down and see sarah." get start immediately. push and 
maybe i could catch him off guard. "i'm very worried about her." 

"of course." he nodded. "whenever you wish." 

"i was thinking, as soon as possible." 

"then i'll send marcelina to take you, the minute she's finished 
downstairs. but i assume you might want to at least unpack first." 

with that he disappear as quiet as he'd come. 

i walk over and stare out at the bird flit past the slat 
window, feeling my hope go up. the colors and the 

freedom. i want to be one of them, to take sarah and just fly away. . 
. . 

then, feeling vague drowsy, i settled myself down on the edge of the 
bed. the next thing i knew, though, the chaotic music of the bird had 
begun to sound amplify as though they were swirl down a long, 
echo hallway. in spite of myself, i felt my consciousness begin to 
drift. 

shit, that needle he just slam into my arm. it wasn't to take blood 
you idiot. you suspect that, but he was too fast. shit. shit. shit. 
don't let him do it. stay awake. 

but now the tunnel was growing. i pull myself up and stagger in 
slow motion to the door and try it, but it seem to be locked. i 
couldn't really tell, though, because the tunnel was swallow me. 

no! i bang my head against the door, hope the pain would bring me 
back, but the room just swirl even more. 

the tunnel. now it was all around me, shadowy and dim. i thought i 
glimpse sarah at the end of it, wearing a white shift, beckon me, 
but when i reach out for her, to take us away, all i could touch was 
empty mist. 




chapter twenty-four 


i'm on a bed, in a dreamscape room envelop in pastel fog, watch a 
melania butterfly the size of a man pump his massive orange and black 
wings above me. his voice is mellifluous, hypnotic, and i feel the soft 
wind of his wings against my face, cooling, scented, enveloping. it is 
the soft of eternal peace. 

"your body is a realm of fertility," he is saying, his tone echo in 
the shadowy haze around me, sonorous and caring. "you are special." 
then, iridescent blues and purple shimmer off his wings, his face 
evolve into the orange and black mask of a jaguar. "you are one of the 
special ones. together we will create life." 

did he say "special"? marcelina said i was . . . like sarah . . . 

now his eyes are bore in and i'm thinking of the china . . . am i 
human, dream i'm a butterfly, or am i a butterfly dream i'm human? 

as he move over me, the rest of his butterfly form disappear and he's 
become a lithe jaguar whose lip are touching mine. the sheet over me 
melt into my skin as the soft spotted fur of his underbelly press 
onto me. and his face has turn even more feline and sensuous, with 
dark eyes that look directly through me. i can feel his whiskers 
against me as he sniff down my body, then explore my groin with his 
probe tongue. 

before i realize what's happening, his thigh press against mine and he 
knowingly insinuate himself into me. it all happen so naturally and 
effortless i scarcely . . . i see only an intense twitch of his 
animal ears, erect and direct toward me, as he enfold me completely, 
his hot male breath urgent. as he grind his thigh against mine, he 
emit growls, low in his throat, then nip lightly and loving at my 
cheek, his pale fang benign and delicious. 

i cling to him, bath in sweat, fall into him, wanting him, but now 
. . . 

he's changing. . . . my god. no! he's . . . 

his face is becoming a jade mask with eyes that burn a fiery red, a 
spirit of evil. he's plunge something deep into me, metal, cold and 
cutting. far inside, reaching, while my mind fight through the wave 
of pain that course down my lower body. i struggle back, but my arms 
just pass through empty air. stop. the eyes, the hard metal . . . time 
turn fluid, minutes are hours, lost, and i don't know . . . 

finally---it could be years later--he growl one last time and the room 
begin fade to darkness. then a blessed numb wash over me. he's 
gone. . . . 

and i dream i am dead. 

sometime, probably hour later, i sense my consciousness gradual 
returning. around me the room was still dark and, remember the 
"dream," i came fully awake with a start, my heart pounding. what had . 
. . it done to me? i was shivering, with a piercing, pointed ache in my 
groin. i need air. 

i rose up unsteadi and reach out, and realize i was in a hospital 
bed with metal bar along one side. 

what! how did i come to be in this? then i began remembering. i was at 
_baalum_, in alex goddard's nino del mundo clinic. and i'd been try 
to get sarah and take her home. 

instead, i'd pass out and then . . . an attack, some unspeakable evil 
. . . 

get out of here. now. 

i settled my feet onto the floor with a surge of determination, and 
that was when i sense i was in a different place from where i'd . . . 
where--! 

i gaze around in the dark, then reach out and felt something on a 
table beside the bed. it was a clay bowl full of wax. what . . . a 
candle. and next to it i touched a plain book of matches. my hand was 
tremble from the pain in my groin, but i manage to light the candle, 
a flicker glow. 

my wristwatch was lie nearby on the table. someone must have taken it 
off and placed it there. i picked it up and held it by the candle, and 
for a moment i was confuse by the seconds ticking off. then i realize 
the time was . . . how could that be! it read 4:57 a.m. had i been out 
for hours? 

i gasped, then raise the candle and gaze around. the wall were brown 
stone--or maybe they just look like stone. yes, now i recognize it. 
i was in the fiberglass-walled operate room i'd seen on alex 
goddard's closed-circuit monitor. 

what was i do in here? 

my arm brush against the table and i felt an odd sensation. glancing 
down, i realize there was a band-aid on the inside of my left wrist. 
what was that about? early he'd taken blood from my right arm, but 
then he'd just swab it, so why this bandage? and what in hell was i 
do in an operate room? i hadn't agree to any procedures. did he 
come back for a second--? 

or . . . that was what he'd done. he'd inject me with an iv drug. the 
bizarre vision i'd had was his cover for some perverse invasion of my 
body. my god, i'd been unconscious since yesterday afternoon. during 
all that time, what could he have done to me? 

i was fist-clenching furious. look around the "operating room," i 
want to rip the place apart. 

when i try to stand, i realize my groin was tender and sore as hell, 
all across my panty-line, only somewhere deep, deep inside, in my 
reproductive . . . it was like after he'd given me those shot up at 
quetzal manor. i checked and saw no red needle-punctures this time, but 
the pain was much worse. that sick butterfly-jaguar dream was no dream. 
i'd been rape by . . . the bastard. 

i pushed aside the pain, edge across to the door, and test it. 
unlocked. good. go find the sob right now. tear his head off. 

i pull back the door, took a deep breath, and checked out the hallway. 

whoa! how did they get here? in the dim light i made out two uniformed 
army private down at the end near the slat windows, doze in 
fold metal chairs, their ak-47's prop against the plaster wall. 

why were they here? just a cool, breezy place to hang out? or were they 
in place to guard me? 

the breeze was cause the candle's flame to cast flicker shadow 
across the hall, so i quick re-closed the door. 

now what? i was tremble as i return the candle bowl to the table 
and sat down on the bed. soldier with gun were outside my room at 
five in the morning. in the farthest end of guatemala. what was i go 
to do? 

i gaze around at the "stone" wall and try to think. my mind still 
felt cloud from whatever drug he'd given me, but it was beginning to 
. . . 

wait. i saw alex goddard come into this very room with embryo from the 
lab, which is connected by the steel door to his office. . . . 

where there was a phone. 

time to call the embassy, get some help to get the hell out of here. 

i sat there thinking. all right. i'd need to wait an hour or so--now 
i'd get some low-level flunkie stuck with the graveyard shift--but 
there was something i was damn well go to do immediately. with the 
lab right next door, i could try to find out why goddard had just 
perform medical rape on me. there had to be some connection. 
according to him, the lab was for "plant research." but if that was all 
he was doing, why was the army here? right outside my door? i felt a 
pump of adrenaline that made me forget all about my pain. before i got 
the hell out of _baalum_, i was go to know what he was really up to 
here. 

god, i feel miserable. i really hurt. all the more reason . . . 

i took the candle, stood up, and move to the opposite wall to begin 
look for an opening in the fiberglass "stone." it appear to have 
been made from impression from the room atop the pyramid, row and 
row of those little cartoon-face glyphs, mixed in with bas-reliefs, 
but there had to be a door somewhere. i'd seen him walk right through 
it. as i ran my hand along the surface, i was struck by how their 
hardness felt like stone. but it couldn't be. 

what was i look for? there certainly were no doorknobs. i came 
across a hard crack, next to the bas-relief of a feather-festooned 
warrior, but as i slid my hand down, it end and again there was more 
rough "stone." solid. 

damn. i stood back and studied the wall with my candle. he'd come in 
from the left, which would be about . . . 

i move over and start again. this time my fingernail caught in a 
crevice that ran directly down to the floor. then i discover another, 
about two and a half feet farther along. it had to be the door. 

i felt along the side, wonder how to open it, till i notice that 
one of the little "stone" glyph gave way when i pressed it. when i put 
my hand against it hard and rotate it, the panel click backward, 
then swung inward. yes! 

and there it was: the lab, crt screen above the incubators, gas 
chromatograph in the corner. this, according to him, was where he 
test the rainforest plant the shaman and midwife brought in. but 
what about what he'd just done to _me_? 

i was still worried about the army guy outside, but i walk in, 
try to be as quiet as i could. the first thing i did was head for 
the row of black box above the bench. those, i assumed, were being 
use to maintain a micro-environment for incubate plant specimens. 
and sure enough, the dim lit window reveal row and row of petri 
dishes. they were clear, with circular indentation in the center. . . . 

but wait a minute. those weren't just any old lab dishes. and no plant 
extract were in them either, just clear liquid. that was odd, very 
fishy. 

i stood there puzzling, and then i remember seeing pictures of lab 
dishes like these being use for artificial fertilize embryos. at 
the beginning, freshly extract human ova are placed in an incubator 
for several hours, afloat in a medium that replicate the inside of a 
female fallopian tube, to mature them in preparation for fertilization. 
goddard had said something about test on the blastocyst, the first 
cellular material create after fertilization. so was he use actual 
fetuses? my god. i felt like i was start to know, or guess, a lot 
more than he want me to. 

my thought were churn as i look up and studied the video screen 
above the boxes. it took a moment, but then i figured out the petri 
dishes and their chemical had been placed in the incubator between 
4:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. last evening. what--? 

i start counting. they were in racks, stacked, in set of 

four by four. let's see. five in this incubator, five in the next, five 
in the . . . there were over two hundred dishes in all! 

impossible. i look down at them again, feeling a chill. nothing 
seem to be in them yet, at least as far as i could tell, but then 
human egg are microscopic. so if ova were . . . 

when he supposedly was do that _in vitro _on the mayan woman, was he 
actually extract eggs? 

get serious. that was not where they came from. 

by then i was well along the kubler-ross scale, past denial and close 
in on anger, but still . . . so many! how could they all-- 

i turn and examine the row of plastic-covered jug at the back of 
the lab, line up, six in all. now i had to know what was in them. 

i was still shaky, but i steady myself, walk over, pull back the 
plastic, and touched one. it was deathly cold, sweat in the moist 
air. when i flip open its frisbee-sized top, i saw a faint wisp of 
vapor emerge into the twilight of the room . . . 

then it dawn on me. of course. they were cryo-storage containers. 
he'd need them to preserve fertilize eggs, embryos. 

i lift off the inside cover and placed it careful onto the bench, 
where it immediately turn white, steam with mist. then i notice a 
tiny metal rod hooked over the side of the opening. when i pull it 
up, it turn out to be attach to a porous metal cylinder contain 
row of glass tubes. 

what's . . .? 

feeling like i was deep in a medical fourth dimension, i took out one 
of the freezing tubes. it was notch and marked with a code label 
along the side: "bl -1 la," "bl -1 lb," "bl-1 lc," and so it went, all 
the way to "g." but nothing was there. 

i began check the other tubes. they all were empty too. so why was 
he freezing empty containers? 

go with the simple answer. he's get them ready for new embryos. 

i slid the rod back into the cryo-tank, then walk over and hoist 
myself onto the lab bench next to the dance shiva, creator and 
destroyer. and when i did, i again felt a stab of pain in my groin. the 
bastard. i was shaking, in the early stage of shock. more than 
anything, i just want to find him and kill him. . . . 

i thought i heard a scrape noise somewhere outside, in the hall, and 
i froze. was he about to come in and check on his "experiments"? then i 
realize it was just the building, his house of horrors, creak from 
the wind. 

i took one final look at the incubators, and all the pain came back. 
the whole thing was too much for my body to take in. i sat there try 
to muster my strength. 

don't stop now. keep going. 

i got back onto my feet. the phone. use the telephone. find steve, 
alert the embassy, then get sarah. do it now, while you still can. 

i was holding my breath as i walk over and pushed open the door to 
the office and look in. it was empty and dark. good. i head 
straight for the black case of the magellan world phone. 

when i picked up the handset and switch it on, the diode went 
through their techno-dance of greens and yellow and then stabilize 
give me a dial tone. thank you, merciful god. 

i decided to start off by calling the hotel in belize again, on the 
long shot that steve had manage to get the hell out of guatemala. 
baby, please be there. my watch said the time was five-twenty in the 
morning, but he once told me they manned the desk around the clock. no 
problem get through, though the connection had a lot of static. but 
then came the news i'd been dreading: no steve abrams. 

"he still not come back, mon." 

where was he? i want to scream, but i was determined to keep a grip. 

all right, try the camino real and hope you can get somebody awake who 
speak english. maybe he went back. please, god. 

i had the number memorized, so i plug it in, and i recognize the 
voice of the guy who picked up, the owner's son, who was try his 
best to learn english. 

"hi, this is morgan james. remember me? i'm just calling to see if 
there's a steve abrams stay there now?" 

"hey, _que pasa_, senora james. very early, yes? _momento_." there was 
a pause as he checked. come on, steve, be there. please, please be 
somewhere. 

then the voice came back: "no, nobody by that name stays here." 

"okay . . . _gracias_." shit. it was like a pit had open somewhere 
deep in my stomach. 

i replace the handset, feeling grateful that at least the phone still 
worked, my last link to sanity. my next call was go to be to the 
embassy, but i couldn't risk use up my opening shot with the 
graveyard shift. maybe by 6 a.m. somebody with authority to do 
something would be there. just a few more minutes. 

now what? i felt the ache sore in my groin again, along with a 
wave of nausea. i had to do something, anything, just to keep going, to 
beat back an anxiety attack. 

that was when i turn and stare at the computers, the little ducks 
drift across the screens. 

all right, you know what he's doing; now it's time to try and find out 
why. the real why. there must be record of what he's up to store 
there. what else would he have them for? 

"clang, clang, clang." a noise erupt from somewhere outside the 
window. in spite of myself, i jumped. 

then i realize it was just the odd call of some forest bird. god, i 
wasn't cut out for this. now my head was hurting, stab of pain, but i 
rub at my temple and sat down at the first terminal. 

i'm a mac fan, hate windows, so i had to start out by experimenting. in 
the movies people always know how to do this, but i had to go with 
trial and error, error compound error. 

after endless false start that elicit utility screen i couldn't get 
rid of, i finally brought up an index of files, which included a long 
list of names. 



alkaloid 

cardiac glycoside 

phenol 

saponin 

terpenoid 



biology 103--which i hated--was coming back. plant-extract categories. 
looks like he actually is do research on the flora here. but . . . 
still, what do he need my ova for? 

i scroll on. scientific terms that meant nothing. then, toward the 
end of the alphabetical list, i came to the word quetzal. 

what was that? i click on it and--lo and behold--up came a short list 
of names. six in all, organized by dates about a year apart, and each a 
woman. 

my god. first i assume they were patient from quetzal manor who'd 
come here for fertility treatment, though each was indicate 
"terminated" at the end, whatever that meant. but as i scan down, i 
didn't want to see what i was seeing. the name next to the last was s. 
crenshaw. she'd been "terminated" too. 

the bottom was m. james. but i hadn't been "terminated." not yet. 

i slump back in the chair, try to breathe. how much more of this 
horror could i handle? finally i lean forward again and with a 
tremble hand click on s. crenshaw. 

a lot of data pop up, including three important dates. the first was 
exactly three week after the one in her passport, the guatemala entry 
visa. the second was ten month ago, the third eight month ago. after 
each was a number: 268, follow by 153, and finally 31. 

the count of her extract ova. kill him. just kill him. 

a lot of medical terminology i couldn't interpret follow each number, 
but the note at the end require no degree. 

"blastocyst material from embryo after third extraction show 84% 
decrease in cellular viability. no long usable." 

my god, had he made her permanent sterile? 

while that obscenity was sink in, i went back and click on my own 
name. the date was today, the number was 233. he'd just taken 233 of my 
ova. i stare at the screen and felt faint. 

no medical analysis had yet been entered, but it didn't matter. i 
stare at the screen, feeling numb, for a full minute before click 
back to sarah's page. yes, i was right. the last date was just six 
week before she was found in a coma, down the river from here. . . . 

no more mystery. he'd been use her egg to create embryos, and they'd 
finally stop working. not "special" anymore. so her "program" had 
been "terminated." in the river. 

my stomach was churning, bile in my throat, and i thought 

i was go to throw up. i took a deep breath, slowly, and stop 
myself. before i got sarah and we got the hell out of _baalum_, i was 
go to smash everything in this lab. 

it all had just come together. those shot of "muscle relaxant" he gave 
me up at quetzal manor, they had to be a cocktail of his "proprietary" 
ovulate drugs. then, with my ovary ripening, he'd lure me here 
use sarah. he knew i'd come after her. next he'd "arranged" with alan 
dupre to fly me here. finally, a sedative, and he'd harvest 233 of my 
ova, which he now had out there in those incubators. . . . 

but what about proof? to show the world. morning sound were building 
up outside, so i was less worried whether the two soldier in the 
hallway were still asleep or not. truthfully, i was so wire i no 
long cared. i click on a printer and began zip off the file of 
each woman he'd violated, all six. 

disgust flow through me like a torrent. heart of darkness. "the 
horror, the horror." alex goddard had use sarah in the most 
unspeakable way possible, then try to have her murdered. probably 
he'd just turn her over to colonel ramos. 

the same thing must have happen to those other women. all 
"disappeared" somewhere in guatemala. but who would know? 

one thing i knew. i was next. . . . 

the printer was old and loud, but thankful it was fast. four minutes 
later i had what i'd need to nail the criminal. when i got out of here, 
somebody would have to believe me. 

while i was stack the printouts, i resolve to call the embassy 
right then, the hour be damned. i was sweat like a gazelle when the 
lion is close in. alex goddard had just perform primal, surgical 
rape on me, and now the army was right outside. i had to get the 
embassy. 

and that was when i realize i didn't have the number. but it had to be 
in a phone book somewhere. 

a quick look around the office didn't turn up one. i considered ring 
the camino real again, to ask them to look up the number, but then i 
had an inspired thought. steve had said alan dupre's number was easy to 
remember because it promote his business. what was it? i couldn't 
remember. 

then it came back: 4-mayan, the six-digit number they use in guatemala 
city. call the sleazebag and ask him who can get me out of here. he's 
supposed to know everybody. 

dawn was bring more and more forest-morning song through the thin 
slat of the windows. i walk over and pushed them open, running my 
finger out into the air. it felt cool, the touch of freedom, and i 
thought for a moment about burst through to escape. just get sarah 
now. 

instead, i walk back to the phone, clench my fists, and dial 
alan dupre's number, pray and hope it was where he lived. steve 
had call him late in the evening, so it probably was. i'd thought i 
never want to speak to him again, but now . . . god, let him be there. 

the phone, however, just rang and rang and rang. 

come on. damn. 

it rang and rang some more. then finally-- 

"who the fuck is this? we don't open till nine." 

the first sound of his voice brought a wave of relief, but then his 
cocky attitude made me livid all over again. 

"it's morgan james, you shit. why did you leave me stranded up here? 
you have no idea what--" 

"oh, you . . ." he pause for a cigarette cough. "you made me walk all 
the way downstairs just to bust my chops. what the--?" 

"talk to me, you prick." i still intended to strangle him. "i need your 
help. you owe me. you have no idea what--" 

"hey, lady, you didn't possibly believe taking off in that fucking 
hurricane was my . . . let's just say i was acting under duress. i all 
but didn't get back." 

"well, you can start making up for that right now by spring me the 
hell out of here." so, somebody had put him up to it, just like i'd 
thought all along. but who? "i want you to look up the number for the 
america embassy. and tell me the name of somebody there who--" 

"jesus, you truly don't get the picture, do you?" he pause for another 
early-morning reefer hack. 

"i 'get' that you--" 

"missy, it was a high official at that very establishment 'suggested' i 
fly you up there. why the hell else would i do it, for chrissake? you 
know i'm not a citizen of this fun house. said party noted that if i 
didn't, he could make a few phone call about my residency status, my 
pilot's license . . . let's just say it was an offer i didn't see fit 
to take issue with." 

"oh, my god." i felt like a knife had just plunge into my back. "was 
his name barry morton? please tell me." 

"taking the fifth on that one," he said cough again. "but you've got 
primal instincts." 

i heard a noise outside and sank lower in the chair. what was i go 
to do now? 

"listen, do you have any idea where steve is? they're looking--" 

"no shit, madame sherlock. i had a long, deep uninspire 
interrogate by a couple of upscale asshole who show up here in an 
army jeep. they want to know where the fuck he was, when i'd sup 
with him last. let me inform you, love, you got my old heartstrings 
buddy in some decided doo-doo." 

"i feel guilty enough about that as is, so stop." in spite of all alex 
goddard had done, i felt horrible about steve, like a self-involved 
witch. "but do you know where he is now?" 

"haven't the foggiest fucking idea, never heard of the jerk. shit, hang 
on." the line went silent, and i could feel my pulse pounding. 

outside the office door, i heard footstep approach down the hall. 
please, god, please. but then they pass by, terminate where the two 
soldier had been dozing. next i heard the tone of a solid 
dressing-down in profane spanish. 

"_tu here un pedaso de mierda!"_ 

then came a familiar voice from the receiver. i couldn't believe it. 

"morgy, why in hell did you let alan take you up there by yourself?" 
his tone had a sadness, and a deserve pique, that cut me to the core. 

i think i stop breathing. 

"oh, baby, thank god you're . . ." i was expect the door to burst 
open any moment. men with ak-47's. "do you know the army's look 
for--?" 

"you're completely nuts. i got halfway to belize and call the motel 
to see how you were doing, and they told me you'd taken off with this 
asshole. so i turn around and drove back here. it was after midnight 
and the army thug had just left. morgy, i'm coming to get you. soon as 
the gas station open. i know a back road to mexico. we've got to get 
out of this fucking country immediately." 

"don't try to drive up. it's too dangerous. can you get alan to fly 
you? sarah's here and she's been turn into a space cadet. i don't 
know how i'm go to pry her away." i stop to try to assemble my 
thoughts. "he's got soldier watch me. i've got to smuggle her out 
somehow." 

i couldn't bring myself to tell him what was really go on. 

"let me talk to dupre a second. the fucker. i can't believe he did this 
to you. but maybe we can come up with something. otherwise, i may just 
kill him with my bare hands." 

i heard a cough, which told me alan had been listen in on an 
extension. it teed me off, but then--he did have to be in on this. 
shit. the idea of rely on alan dupre for anything . . . 

"well, do it fast. i broke into alex goddard's office to use this phone 
and . . . just hurry." 

"you got it." 

now the sound of firm, officer-like boot steps storm past the door, 
head out this time, after which the two young soldier began berate 
each other in high-pitched spanish. 

"_hace falta ten cojones!_" 

"_hijo de tu chingada madre!_" 

more and more light was creep through the slat windows. a glance 
at my watch show the time to be six sharp, but the embassy was no 
long an option. 

"listen," steve said coming back on, "there's some rain due for 
tonight, but he say he think we can try. he claim there's a clearing 
about a quarter of a mile down a gravel road that go south. with the 
rain as cover, maybe we can put down just after dark. think you can 
find a way to get sarah and meet us?" 

"i'm not even sure she can walk, at least not far, but we'll be there." 
i was flash on her back in the square, proclaim her happiness. 
would i have to drag her out, carry her on my back? well, i would. 
"there's some kind of 'ceremony' on for tomorrow morning. the army's 
go to be here in double strength because of it, but maybe it'll make 
for some confusion that'll help. still, she's--" 

"damn, this is go to be big-time dicey." 

"honey, let me tell you as much as i can about the layout of this 
place. just in case." 

which i did. the main problem was, i didn't know exactly where sarah 
was. 

"is there anybody there who could help you?" he ask when i'd finished. 

"i'm not hopeful." i paused. "listen, can you get your hand on a gun 
or guns?" 

"what are you . . . don't even think about it! that's the best way to 
guarantee we all get killed. i'm not taking on the guatemala armed 
forces. and you're not either. we've got to keep this very low-tech. 
the dark and the rain, that's what we use. they don't shoot back." 

at that moment i want nothing more than to shoot alex goddard. i'd 
have done it if i'd had the chance. happily. but i knew steve was right. 

"okay, look, what time?" 

"we'll try to set down about, say--" 

there was a crackle as the yellow diode on the phone erupt in a 
high-pitched whistle, cutting the connection. 

no! my god, had somebody been listen in? 

so when exactly was he coming? around dark? that would probably be 
about eight o'clock. or maybe nine . . . 

i was close the phone case when i heard a sound from outside, as 
though someone had pass the door, then come back to listen. 

all right. get going. 

i gather the printouts, then head back through the laboratory, 
where i took a long, last look at the petri dishes being incubated. 
should i just dump them now? but then he'd know for sure that i knew. 

the time would come, and soon. 

as i ease myself back into the fake-stone or and closed the door, the 
dawn outside was steep in forest sounds, clack and whistle and 
chirps. that was good, because i need some stray noise to mask what i 
was go to do next. take control. 




chapter twenty-five 


i began by feeling along the fake-stone wall to find where the 
crevice were, the door that enclose the medical instruments. 
somewhere, i was sure, there was a cabinet that held a complete set of 
surgical equipment. 

when i found the first crevice, i gave the wall on either side a push 
and, sure enough, the panel was spring-loaded. good. the side on the 
right of the crevice pop open to reveal the microscope goddard had 
used. but nothing else was there. 

i move on down the wall test for cabinets, try to remember what 
marcelina had done when alex goddard told her to prep the mayan woman. 
one after another the panel snap open till . . . yes, this was the 
one i wanted. hallelujah. 

the third drawer held the scalpels. i took out the largest i could 
find, heavy and steel, then wedged it into the metal slide mechanism 
and snap off the tip. perfect. 

i felt like i was holding the key to my escape as i careful reclose 
all the panels. since there were no window in the or room, i slip 
back through the lab--it had now become a haunt place of monstrous 
obscenity to me--and checked out the office. 

it was still deserted, but now the hazy light of early day was mingle 
with the sound of nature seep through the slat window. as i 
walk over to it, the cool, moist morning air once again felt like 
freedom. how long did i have before the clinic start stirring? 

i'd originally plan to try to unscrew some of the slats, but that 
turn out to be unnecessary. the strip of wood were held in with 
crude, rusty clamps, and one by one i began pry them out with the 
blunt scalpel. i figured five slat should give me enough space to 
squeeze through, and i'd already remove three when i heard a 
frustrate voice in spain just down the hail. uh-oh. 

"_tengo que mear que mis diente flotan!_" it was follow by the sound 
of boots head toward the office. 

i duck down behind a desk, holding my breath, but then the footstep 
march past, head for the front door of the clinic. that was when i 
finally process what he'd said: "i've got to piss so bad my teeth are 
floating." 

so where was he headed? 

moments later i knew. i heard the noise of someone kick their way 
through the underbrush till they were right next to the window, 
follow by the sound of a zipper. 

my god, i thought, he's right here. will he spot the missing slats? 

i bit my lip as i listen to a member of the guatemala armed forces 
vigorous urinate upon the north wall of alex goddard's clinic. well, 
i told myself, that's probably what they think of him. i'd like to do 
the same. 

then came a confirm re-zip, after which the sound of slash boots 
fade back into the distance. if he'd notice the window i'd just 
burgled, it hadn't alert his curiosity. moments later i heard his 
heavy footstep return up the hall. 

jesus, two minutes more and i'd have been out there. 

i was trembling, but i manage to finish pry out the last two slats. 
i then pushed all five out onto the ground, hope the clatter would be 
lost in forest music, and climb through after them, try to be as 
quiet as i could. i end up go out headfirst and collapse onto 
the ground in an unceremonious crumple. thirty seconds later, though, 
the slat were wedged roughly back into place, and i'd discard the 
broken scalpel in the jungle underbrush. yes! 

now the cool air of freedom was all around me. my first small step. 

how long before alex goddard discover i'm missing? will i have time to 
find sarah, bring her to her senses, and hide her from him? a lot would 
depend on what kind of physical and mental shape she was in. 

as i pass around the parking lot, gray cloud were thicken 
overhead and i notice that half a dozen new olive-green jeep were 
park there. the army was arrive in force, get ready for god 
know what. i took one look at them and felt my breath start coming in 
bursts. steve, we're go to need our own kind of miracle. how are we 
go to get out of here? 

i skirt the edge of the lot and reach the trail leading down into 
the village. and i was try to quell my pulse. what was down there? 
with the dense rain forest arch over me, i felt as though i was 
enter a domain of maya dreamtime where the past live again, only 
with a sinister twist. 

the air in the dark grove was thick with the buzz of insects, 
harbinger of the coming rainstorm, but before long i caught a glimmer 
of daylight ahead. soon i emerge into a wide arbor that, after another 
hundred feet, open onto the central plaza and the pyramid. now . . . 

it was daylight, but it also was . . . the sight took my breath away. 
what was go on? 

a mill horde of men was gather in the square, and resinous torch 
were flaming on each of the pyramid's tier of steps. a lot of drink 
from clay jug was get under way, and the men were in the process 
of painting their faces, stripe of black and white, with dark circle 
around their eyes. some also were apply row of 
red-and-green-colored seed to their cheek with white glue. the 
bizarre of the scene ripple through me like the shard of a 
dysfunctional dream. jesus! 

alex goddard had said the ceremony got "frenzied," and now i was 
beginning to realize. . . . what were they get ready to do? had i 
been wrong in thinking the classical maya never got around to rip 
out hearts? did that explain the half-dozen young army private 
loiter there at the far side, rifles slung over their shoulders? 

i melt back into the tree and studied the geometry of the plaza, 
reconsider my situation. i need to find some way to get around it 
and onto the cobblestone pathway at the far side, which led into the 
village. finally i decided i could skirt the periphery if i was careful 
not to advertise my presence. dawn had come and gone and the quick 
light of tropical day was arriving, but everybody appear to be 
pre-occupied with their nightmarish preparations. 

thank god it worked. i weave in and among the tree and in five 
minutes i'd reach the central pathway, now deserted. still barely 
letting myself breathe, i turn back and gaze up at the pyramid. i 
had no idea what was next, but i decided it would be my signpost, to 
help me keep my bearings as i move through the confusing, 
tree-shrouded hut of _baalum_. except for the men in the square, the 
village now seem deserted, though a pack of brown dogs, curious and 
annoying, had spotted me and now circle around to sniff. don't bark, 
damn it. 

that was when i saw marcelina, in her white shift, stride through the 
crowd of drink men like an alpha lioness parting a posture pride. 
my god. my heart stop for a moment. do alex goddard already know 
i've flee and has he sent her to lure me back? 

no way. i clench my fist and kick at the surly, long-tailed mutts, 
still circle and nuzzling. 

as she came closer, i saw she was smile and carry a brown wicker 
basket. what. . . 

"i've brought you something," she announce as she walk up, her dark 
eyes oddly kind. "you must be starve by now." 

"how did you know i was down here?" look at her earnest mayan face, 
i sudden wonder if she could have any idea what alex goddard had 
done to sarah, and to me? 

"you were gone from your room," she declared, settle the basket onto 
the walkway and beginning to open it. "where else would you be?" when i 
looked, i saw it had a seal container of yogurt, a banana, and two 
eggs, presumable hard-boiled--traditional "safe" food for gringo in 
third world places. "i'd been plan to bring you down today," she 
went on. "they all want to meet you." 

was she coming to look after me? the more i examine her, the more i 
began to suspect something else was go on. would she help me get 
sarah out and away from alex goddard? 

"i want to find sarah," i said. why not start out with the truth? "does 
he . . . dr. goddard know i'm here?" 

"he's not here now," she said, her eyes shift down. "he left for 
guatemala city early this morning. i think to meet with the army. on 
business. . . ." 

yes. his big humvee hadn't been in the clinic's parking lot when i went 
by. why hadn't i notice that? for the first time i felt the odds were 
tipping. now was go to be the perfect time to get sarah. yes. yes. 
yes. 

"if you want to see her, i can take you," marcelina offered, replace 
the lid on the basket. 

yes, perfect. i want to hug her. 

"then let's go right now" and while i was at it, i was determined to 
get through to this woman somehow, to enlist her help. 

as we head down the central walkway of the village, we pass the 
row of compound where i'd seen the women that first morning. none was 
in evidence now, and the garden were empty, as though the entire 
settlement had been evacuated. it felt very strange. 

and what about those bizarre proceedings now under way in the square? 
was that go to interfere with get sarah out? 

"marcelina." i pointed back toward the mill plaza. "what's that all 
about? the drink and the--?" 

"it's begun," she answered, both simple and vague. "they're get 
ready." 

i didn't like the way she said it. her tone seem to imply i was 
involved somehow. 

"ready for--?" 

"the ceremony. they like to drink a tree-bark liquor we call _balche_. 
it's very strong and rancid." she smile and touched me. "take my 
advice and avoid it." 

"i plan to." why did she think i'd even be offer it? 

as we hurried along, two women abrupt appear on a porch, bowed, and 
greet us. marcelina wave back, then went over and spoke earnest 
with them for a moment. finally she turn and motion for me. 

"they've invite you in." 

something about the easy way it all just "happened" felt as though 
they'd been expect me. had marcelina's trip down to the village been 
part of a setup, witting or unwittingly? 

"i told them we could only stay for a minute," she went on. i sense 
she was reluctant, but felt we had no choice. 

the last thing i want to do was this. 

"marcelina, can't you tell them we'll come back later?" 

"it's . . . it's important." she was beckon for me. "please." 

well, i thought, this could give me the time i need, the personal 
moment, to get through to her. even after i locate sarah, spirit her 
out isn't go to be simple. i've got to make marcelina understand 
what's really go on, then get her to help us. 

as we head through the yard, the women smiled, then polite led us 
under the thatch overhang and into the hut. they both were short and 
maya-sturdy, with white shift and broad faces, and they exude a 
confident intensity in their bearing, a powerful sense of 
self-knowledge. i try a phrase in spanish, but they just stare at me 
as though they'd never heard the language. then i remember my first 
attempt to ask about sarah. the women hadn't understood me then either. 
or had they? 

the room they usher us into had no windows, but there was cool, 
shadowy morning light filter through the upright wooden slat of the 
walls, lay dim stripe across the earthen floor. a cooking fire 
smolder in a central hearth, and from the smoke-blackened roof beam 
dangle dry gourds, bundle of tobacco, nett bags of onion and 
squash, and several leaf-wrapped block of salt. the room smell of 
ancient smoke, sweet and pungent. 

they immediately produce a calabash bowl with a gray liquid inside, 
pronounce the word _atole _as they urge it on me, smile 
expectantly. 

"it's our special drink," marcelina explained. she seem to be wary, 
watch me close as they hand it over. "it's how we welcome an 
honor guest." 

i wasn't sure how politic i ought to be. third world food . . . 

"marcelina," i said, taking the bowl and try to smile. "i'm not 
really--" 

"you must have a little," she whisper back. "it would be very rude. . 
. ." 

well, i thought, just a taste. i try it and realize it was a dense 
gruel of cornmeal and honey-water, like a lukewarm gluey porridge, 
though with a bitter after-jolt. but i choke it down and try to look 
pleased. marcelina urge me to have more--i took another small sip--and 
then they produce corn dumpling wrap in large leaves, together 
with a pile of fiery chile and a bowl of squash, corn, and beans, all 
mixed together. 

after one bite, though, marcelina reach out and--her eyes 
downcast--whisked the bowls away, passing them back to the women. she 
said something to them, then turn to me. 

"eating too much would be as rude as not eat at all." 

that was a cultural norm i didn't remember, and i suspect she'd just 
change her mind about the wisdom of my eat local food. 

i smile at the women and use some of my so-so spain to offer them 
thanks. 

"_muchas gracias_." i nod toward the bowls. "_esta es muy 
delicioso_." 

they beam as though they understood me. who could say? but they'd 
been intense interested in watch me eat, even more than marcelina. 

work on her. now. 

"marcelina." i turn to her, only vague notice she hadn't had a 
bite. "do you understand why dr. goddard move me down to the operate 
room yesterday? there in the clinic? what did he tell you?" 

"he said it was for special tests." her voice was gentle through the 
gloom. "you were very . . . sleepy. you must have been very, very 
tired. but he told me something in your blood work was unusual, so he 
had me bring you down for a pelvic exam. i gave you a sedative"--she 
was point at the band-aid still on my arm--"the way we always do. 
but then he said you were fine." 

"do you realize he did things to my body i didn't agree to?" i studied 
her trust mayan face and try to get a sense of how much she knew 
about what was go on. that was when i first became sure of an 
increase disquiet in her eyes, as she kept glancing away. why was she 
so uncomfortable talk about alex goddard? "and i think he did some 
of those same things to sarah." 

"dr. goddard try to help her in many ways when she was here before." 
marcelina's tone had become odd and distant. "now he wants to help you 
too." 

yes, there was definitely something uneasy in her eyes. 

"before he came here," she went on, try to look at me, "_baalum _was 
just a poor, simple village. many children die of diseases. so i left 
and went to guatemala city to study. to become a public-health nurse. 
then after he came here, i move back to help him with his clinic, the 
children." 

she was try to make a case for him, and i notice she'd avoid the 
actual question. 

"now _baalum _has become a special place," she said finally. "a place 
of miracles. and if a woman from outside comes, she can be part of 
that. when sara was here before, i start teaching her to speak our 
language, and the other did too. she truly want to be part of his 
miracles. sometimes we don't understand how they happen, but he has 
great medical powers." 

one thing's for sure, i thought. he's got plenty of power over the 
people here, including you. the whole place has been brainwashed. i 
look her over and realize she'd just gone on mental autopilot. she 
wants to be loyal to him, and she can't let herself believe there's 
something rotten in the "special" paradise of _baalum_. 

"listen," i said, get up, "i need to go see sarah right now. her 
father's been in the hospital, and he's not well. i spoke with him 
yesterday, and he's very worried about her. i know dr. goddard is 
treat her, but it's better if i just take her home immediately." 

more and more i was beginning to suspect this detour for the two women 
had been a diversion, an attempt to stall. marcelina had set it up. 
maybe she want to tell me something, and she didn't have the nerve to 
do it point-blank. 

"families are very important," she said, sound sincere. "we'll go 
now." she spoke to the women briefly, an animate benediction that 
seem to leave her even more disturbed. as we head out and on down 
the path, i again wonder what was really happening. 

when we reach the end of the long "street," the arch arbor still 
above us, she stop in front of an odd stone building unlike any of 
the other and pointed. 

"this is where she likes to be," she said quietly. "except for the 
pyramid, it's the most sacred place in baalum." 

the doorway was a stone arch about five feet high and pointed at the 
top like a tiny gothic cathedral. 

"what . . . is this?" i felt as though i was about to enter something 
from the temple of doom. 

"it was once the royal bath," she explained. "in ancient times heated 
rocks were brought in, with spring water from a sacred _cenote_." 

we walk through the portal and enter a room whose roof was a stone 
latticework that let the gray daylight just filter through. the space 
was vast, with carve and colored glyph all around the walls, while 
the air was fill with cloud of incense from pot along the floor. it 
felt like a smoky pagan church. 

at the far end was a large stone platform, and in the dappled, hazy 
light i could see it was emboss along its side with carve and 
paint classical scene and glyphs, glisten little red and green 
and blue pictures of face and figures. 

my eyes finally start adjust to the shadows, and i realize the 
platform had been fitted with a covering across the top, a jaguar skin 
over bundle straw, and a tiny form was lie on it, wearing a white 
shift. . . . 

dear god. 

"morgy, i've been so hope you'd come," sarah said, rising up and 
holding out her hands. then she slid her feet around onto the rough 
stone floor and manage to steady herself. her shift was wrinkle now, 
but she still was wearing the brown slipper and the braid leather 
waist-cinch. she appear sleepy, though her eyes were sparkle and 
she seem to have more strength than she'd had when i first saw her 
out in the square. i look at her and weigh the chance she could 
walk. possibly. but i'd carry her if i had to. 

"sar, honey, we're go home now," i said, finally finding my voice. 

she didn't respond at first, just turn to caress the decorate side 
of the platform. "i've been wanting to show you this, morgy. it tell 
my story." her voice sound as if it were coming from a long way off, 
as though through a dense haze. 

"please, we don't have time for stories." was she hearing me at all? 
"let's just--" 

"see," she went on, ignore me as she pointed down, "that's the cosmic 
monster, that one there with maize sprout out of his forehead. and 
that man next to him with a flint knife is my father, letting blood 
from his penis. he's the king. and that one there is me, lady jaguar. 
he gave my name to this place." she pause to reverent touch the 
carve stone. "look, i've just stuck a stingray spine through my tongue 
and put my blood in the _copal_ censer there." 

"sar, please--" 

"here, see it?" she was point to a section at the very end. "that's 
the two-headed vision serpent up above me. he's the god kukulkan . . . 
or something. i've made him come to me by give him my blood. i'm--" 

"sar, what in heaven's name is go on with you?" i grab her and in 
spite of myself, shook her. jesus! the whole scene left me in shock. 
she was sink back deep into her fantasy world. was she taking the 
drug again, i wonder and fantasize she was some dead mayan 
princess? please, god no. 

that was when i saw marcelina walk over to a shelf along the wall and 
lift down another clay-pot incense burner, along with a small white 
brick. what--? 

"oh, yes!" sarah exclaim moving quick over to her. "let's do it for 
morgy." 

marcelina nod warily and hand her the white brick, then turn to 
me. "she likes to do incense. it always calm her. this is _copal_, 
what the shaman use." 

i watch while sarah shaky began crumble pieces of the sticky 
substance into the pot. my god i thought, she's truly, truly lost it. 
next she insert dry tinder and began try to knock sparks into it 
with a piece of hard black jade and a flint. but she was too weak, and 
finally marcelina had to take the flint and do it for her. then, as the 
gray smoke start billow out, marcelina began a long chant, shrill 
and strange melodic. i felt a chill creep down my back. when she 
finished she turn her dark eyes on me sadly, waiting. 

"what were you saying?" i ask finally, sense she want me to. 

"i was singing from the popol vuh." then she translated. 



_holy earth, give of life, 

help us in our struggle against 

the god of the house of darkness. 

_ 

wait a minute. what's she saying? 

"who's the god of the house of darkness?" could she be talk about 
alex goddard? 

"i didn't want to do it," she blurt out, reach out to me, her eyes 
even sadder. "but he said you're the new special one. we had to." 

what the hell was she talk about? had to what? did it have something 
to do with my "visit" to the women in the hut? 

"please stay here with us," she plead as she took my hand. "don't go." 

stay? don't even think about it. i had sarah halfway to freedom. while 
the army was still get its act together, we could lose ourselves 
someplace in the forest where nobody would find us, and when steve got 
here tonight . . . 

"sar, come on, it's time." i pull away from marcelina and slip my 
arm around her. "nothing here is what you think it is." 

"are we leaving?" she asked, her eyes blank. 

"yes, honey, we're leaving. this very minute." 

the dense forest was all about us, and i'd just carry her into it if i 
had to. in the coming storm, nobody was go to find . . . 

that's when i notice i was beginning to have gastric rumblings. damn. 
never, ever eat "native" food, no matter what the social pressure. that 
damn "visit" . . . 

when i turn to ask marcelina if she would help me get sarah outside, 
i notice she'd been join by the two women, both still in their white 
shifts, who'd just fed me the sickly 

sweet _atole_. and more women were behind them, all staring at me, 
expectant, as though wonder what i would do. 

maybe it was my imagination, or the dizzy that was abrupt grow 
around me, but it also seem they'd paint their face with streak 
of white, designs like the men in the square were putt on. 

"she's go to be all right," marcelina was saying. "but we have to 
get you back now. you'll need your strength." 

i need it then. my stomach had really begun to gyrate, and my vision 
had start grow colored. i notice i was sweating, even though the 
day was cool down. actually, i felt as though i was about to pass 
out. what had those women fed me? 

it was finally dawn on me that marcelina's fearful back in the 
hut had nothing to do with betray alex goddard. it was because she 
knew she was betray me. 

well, damn her, i'm not go to let alex goddard win, no matter what. 

"marcelina, please help me. i've got to get sarah out of here. now. i 
don't know what poison drug he's give her, but he's driving her 
insane." 

"we'll take care of her," she said. but i could barely make out the 
words. they echo bouncing around in my head. 

"i'm really get dizzy." i glance over again at the women standing 
by the door. "please tell me what they--?" 

"the elixir," she said. "for tomorrow at sunup. that's when you'll see 
his real power." 

i'd begun experience white spot before my eyes--and for some reason 
i had a vision of the army jeep park up the hill. i didn't know how 
the two were connected but in my jumble thought they seem to be. 

just get sarah and get out into the air. walk, don't think, and you can 
do it. . . . 

i pull her next to me and struggle toward the door, the women 
study us, unmoving. 

"morgy, i've miss you so much," sarah was saying, slip her arms 
around my neck to help herself walk. "i'm . . . i'm ready to go home." 

"i've miss you too." i think my heart was burst as i urge her on 
through the stone portico. at last. had something click that free 
her from alex goddard? maybe her mind was finally becoming her own. 

when we got outside, the sky were grow ever more foreboding, storm 
cloud looming. steve had been right about the coming rain, but now it 
seem the perfect cover for us to just get out. i took a deep breath 
of the misty air and forced myself to start helping sarah up the 
cobblestone path. 

"sar, you can walk, i know you can. be strong. for both of us. i'm . . 
." 

i felt myself sink slow to the cold stone of the walkway, the 
hard abrasion against my knees, sarah tumble forward as i pull her 
down on top of me, marcelina's arms around me try to hold me up. it 
was the last real sensation i would remember. 




chapter twenty-six 


sarah was hover around me, a sylphlike presence, as i watch myself 
drift up the steps of the pyramid there in the square, my senses wax 
and wane like the wave on a distant ocean shore. there seem to be 
rain, or fog, or smoke, but it had a luminous, purple cast one moment, 
a day-glo orange the next. in fact, all the colors were swirl and 
changing, shimmer from hue to hue. a pack of howler monkey was 
cavort up and down the steps on my left, like circus harlequin in 
electric red-and-blue suits, do pratfall and huff as they flew 
through the air and tumble one over another. 

sarah was floating silent beside me, but where was steve? had he 
come? were we escaping? 

no. i sense his face drift across my sight like a cartoon cloud 
before dissolve into nothingness. he wasn't here. i was have the 
eeriest dream i'd ever had. 

when i reach the stone-paved platform at the pinnacle, i felt alex 
goddard clasp my arm and turn me around to face the plaza below. 

"they are waiting," he said, point toward the hazy square. 

i look down, and at first i couldn't see anything except rain and 
smoke, but then slow a crowd materialized. the scatter of men i'd 
seen early had become an undulate sea of upturned face paint 
with stripe and swirl circle of blue and white and red, a 
torch-lit garden of brilliant blossoms. they all were look up at us, 
at sarah and me. 

next he held out a mirror whose reflect surface was a polish 
silver metal. 

"behold yourself, morgan. as befit a royal one, a special one, your 
nose has been built up with clay and pierce with lustrous blue 
feather and a giant topaz. your front teeth have been file to a point 
and inlaid with jewels, your royal skull has been shaped back and 
flattened." 

i gaze into the mirror and gasped. i was monstrous, a halloween harpy. 

then he move over to a waist-high censer station there on the edge 
of the platform and began add balls of sticky white _copal_ resin, 
together with bark and grasses, which he ignite by the quick friction 
of a fire stick spun by a bow. 

finally he turn to me and held out his hands. "now we will make a 
miracle, the miracle of _baalum_." 

heavy smoke from the censer was pour out into the rainy sky as we 
start a stiff _pas de deux_, the strain of a clay flute drift 
around us. was it the "ceremony"? was i dream it? 

as the incense billowed, our maya dreamtime dance became ever more 
intense, and then a faint form began to writhe up out of the haze 
between us, an undulate serpent the deep color of jade. as alex 
goddard wrap his arms around it, it began to form into two dark 
heads, then pirouette above us. finally, as the two-headed specter 
open its mouth and gaze down on the platform, sarah step toward 
it and held out her arms. 

"sar, no!" 

i scream to her to get back, but as i did, the . . . thing reach 
down and swallow her in flames. it was the vision-serpent come to 
receive her. 

"sarah . . ." 

"can you get up now?" said a voice, cutting through the haze that 
envelop my consciousness. at first i thought it was more of the 
dream, but then someone was touching me and i open my eyes to see 
marcelina standing beside the bed i was in, dress in white and 
holding a candle. for a moment i thought i was still atop the rainy 
pyramid but then i felt the moist of the sheet and realize the 
storm id been dream of was being blown in through the slat of the 
windows. i was shivering. 

"marcelina, where's sarah?" the nightmare had seem so real, and now i 
was hallucinating, have flash of colors i didn't want to see. "i 
just had the most horrible dream. i was on the pyramid and there was 
smoke, rain and some kind of ghastly--" 

"it's the elixir. from the toad. it make you dream dream of the old 
ones." she took my hand. "she's rest now. he gave her something to 
calm her." 

more drugs, i thought angrily. 

then i caught the "he." alex goddard must be back. everything had gone 
wrong. 

"i've got to get her and--" 

"not now," marcelina went on, helping me up. "come. i want to show you 
the true miracle of _baalum_. now is the time you should know." 

the upstairs hallway was dim illuminate by row of lights along the 
floor as she led me forward. there also was total silence, except for 
the occasional whimper of a baby in one of the rooms. where was she 
taking me? 

when she stop in front of the third door from the end of the hall, i 
try to get my mental bearings. i was still hallucinating; in control 
of only half my mind to the point where i wasn't sure i could find my 
hand in front of my face. but then she tap on the door and when she 
heard a voice inside, something in the kekchi dialect, she gently 
pushed it open. 

when we move inside, the room was dark and there was no sound, except 
a gasp from the bed when the woman realize i was a gringo. the dim 
slant of illumination from the doorway reveal a small night lamp just 
above the head of her bed, and marcelina reach for it. 

as the light came on, a pale glow filling the room, i notice the woman 
was staring at me, her eyes wide and frightened. 

"she's afraid you've come for her child," marcelina whispered, point 
toward the bassinet. "she know we have to give him back." 

the woman was pure maya, a powerful visage straight off that upright 
stele in the square. i walk over and took her hand, hope to calm 
her fears. then i lift her hand to my cheek and realize my face was 
moist with tears. i held it there for a long moment, till the alarm in 
her eyes diminished. 

her newborn infant was sleep quiet in a crib right next to her, on 
the opposite side from the table. when i look close at him, i 
finally understood everything. 

i laid her hand back onto the bed and walk around. while the woman 
watched, i pull away the strip red and green coverlet and lift 
out her groggy little boy, tender and vulnerable. 

he made a baby's protest as i cradle him, then began sleepy probe 
my left breast, making me feel sad i had no milk. 

"it's okay," i whispered, first to him and then to his mother. "_esta 
bien_." 

"_tz'ac tzotz_," the woman said, point at him. i could feel her 
deep, maternal love. 

"his name?" i ask in english, before i thought. 

when marcelina translated, the woman smile and nodded. 

then the blond-haired tz'ac tzotz start to sniffle, so i kiss him 
gently, turned, and took the woman's hand again. there was nothing else 
i could do. 

tz'ac tzotz was sarah incarnate. this was no hallucination. he had her 
special blue eyes and her steep cheeks, her high brow. i was holding 
her child. 

"they are sent from kukulkan," marcelina was saying, "the white god of 
the plumed serpent. then there's the ceremony on the pyramid and they 
go back." 

the woman was staring at me, seemingly awestruck. then she pointed at 
tz'ac tzotz and at me, saying something to marcelina. finally the woman 
bowed her head to me with great reverence. 

"she say he looks so much like you," marcelina explained. "you are 
surely the special one. the new bride." 

i was still speechless, but then i notice the baby had a little silver 
jaguar amulet tie around his wrist with a silken string, and on the 
back--as on kevin's and rachel's--were row of lines and dots. 

it finally dawn on me. they were digits, written in the archaic maya 
script. what could they be, maybe his birthday? no, i realized, that 
was far too simplistic. this was the original bar code; it was his 
_baalum _"serial number." 

for a long moment it felt as if time had stopped. sarah, and now 
me--we'd been lure here to provide the life force for mayan surrogate 
mothers. this whole elaborate recreation wasn't about rainforest drug 
and research into fertility; it was just a cover to use the body of 
these intense believe native americans. alex goddard had 
perpetrate the greatest systematic exploit of another race since 
slavery. the difference was, he'd found a way to get them to give 
themselves willingly. 

_baalum_ was definitely a place of miracles. there could scarcely be 
another isolated spot on earth where he could find this many sincere, 
trust people with powerful belief he could prostitute. and all of 
it hidden deep in an ancient rainforest. 

but i had to be sure. i turn around, leave marcelina to watch in 
confusion, and march out into the hall and into the next room. the 
maya mother there cry out in shock as i unceremonious strode over 
to her crib and checked. 

her baby was the same. sarah stamp all over him. my god. 

when i went back, marcelina was still try to calm tz'ac tzotz's 
mother with her bedside manner. 

as i stood look at them, the extent of what was go on finally 
settled in. all those new baby at quetzal manor, even kevin and 
rachel--they all look alike because they all were from the same 
woman. the one who was here before sarah. and now hers were ready. 

i was go to be next. the new "bride." those fresh petri dishes down 
in the lab . . . my god, why didn't i destroy them when i had the 
chance? 

so whose sperm would he use? of course. it would be from the man alan 
dupre was go to deliver to him. 

"marcelina, don't you realize what's happening?" i want to pound some 
sense into her. they didn't have to let him do this to them. 

"i know that with miracle must come sadness," she said, reach to 
touch tz'ac tzotz's tiny brow. "we all understand that." 

"it's not a miracle. it's science, don't you realize? _ciencia_. he's 
use you." 

"we know he do many things that are magic. he make powerful 
medicine from the plant we bring him, and when women want to bear a 
child--" 

"no, marcelina." i felt my heart go out to her, and to all the others. 
"it's black magic. it's all a lie." 

the first thing to do was go down to the laboratory and dump every last 
one of my petri dishes into the sink, ova and all. destroy the nest, 
then call steve and warn him. . . . 

i glance at my watch. no! the time was 4:58 a.m. he was coming at nine 
o'clock last night. . . . 

i was standing there in horror, unnatural colors flit across my 
vision, when i heard . . . 

"it's almost morning." 

i jump as alex goddard walk into the room, dress in white, hair 
fall around his shoulders. he took tz'ac tzotz from his crib, 
checked the number on his amulet, and then absently put him back. next 
he examine me, his eyes brim with concern. 

"how're you feeling?" he placed his hand on my brow. when i look 
around for marcelina, i realize she'd vanished. 

"where's steve?" i felt the bottom drop out of my world, my whole 
body trembling. "if you've harm so much as a hair on his head, i'll--" 

"he's here," he said quietly. 

"i want to see him." dear god, what had i done? i want to die. 

"he's been given something to help him rest. are you sure you want to 
disturb him?" 

"i told you i want to see him." i could barely get out the words. "now." 

"if you insist. he's just downstairs." 

we slow walk down the marble steps, my mind flood with more and 
more hallucinations. when we reach the first floor, he open the 
door of a room adjacent to his office. i realize the window slat were 
open, send a rush of moist air across my face. then he motion me 
forward and click on the bedside light. 

steve was there on the bed, comatose. i walk over and lift his 
upper torso, then cradle his head in my arms. baby, i love you. please 
forgive me. please. 

his eyes were firm shut and he didn't stir in the slightest. he was 
in a deathlike stupor, and there were large bruise on his face and a 
bandage across his nose. then his bed shift fell open and i notice 
another bandage on his groin. 

"you've already done it!" i whirl back, ready to kill the bastard. 

"as i said, he was inject with a mild sedative." he had walk over 
and start taking steve's pulse. "given the . . . condition he was in, 
i decided to go with the simplest procedure possible. after he was 
brought in, i made a small incision in the _vas deferen _and extract 
a substantial quantity of motile sperm." he was turning down the 
lights. "don't worry. i've perform the procedure before. the last was 
a sweden tourist who was in a car accident up by lake atitlan and then 
lay in a coma in guatemala city for week on end." 

i listen to him, my mind racing. i'd thought kevin and rachel look 
nordic, big and blond. that swede must have been their father. 

"those ova of mine you took, the way you stole sarah's, and all the 
other women you've brought here--you don't use them for research." 

"i have ample leftover embryonic material here for that." he start 
helping me onto the bed next to steve. now his face was undulate 
through my vision, as though i were seeing it in a wavy mirror. "please 
understand, it's very expensive to run a laboratory up here. but the 
good i'm doing--" 

"you're a criminal." i remember the frightened eyes of the women 
upstairs and felt myself seethe with anger. 

"no! i am, in my special way, give them back a small part of what 
they had taken away by people exactly like us. i'm providing them 
proof, living proof, their truth are still powerful." 

he stroll over to the window and look out. "the women come to me 
for my blessing whenever they hope to bear a child. they know that if 
they wish, i can cause their first child to be a descendant of their 
white deity kukulkan. for them it is a sacred event." 

"they believe that?" it was sickening. i felt a knot grow in my 
stomach, even as my hallucination flash ever bolder, bright rainbow 
that flit about the room, then wound themselves around me. 

"a great philosopher once said, all religion are true.' who are we to 
judge?" he paused. "let me try and explain something. those pattern 
you see the women weave on the fabric down in baalum, those pattern 
are actually just like the designs on that thousand-year-old pyramid. 
but though that pyramid had been bury and lost to them for so many 
years, they still made the designs all those years, because those 
symbol are a road map of their unseen world. not the forest here where 
we are now, but their real world, where the gods dwell who rule the 
lightning bolts, the germinate of corn." he was at the door, 
prepare to leave, but he paused. "they also understand the . . . 
special infant who come are miracle that must be returned. they 
receive but they also must give. now they wish you to be part of that." 

with that he closed the door with a swing of his long hair, a slam 
follow by a hard click. 




chapter twenty-seven 


as i watch him depart, hallucination swirl through my brain like 
furious fireworks, i had a bizarre thought. in an ancient rainforest 
all things are still possible. the old fairy tale we grew up with 
mostly took place in a deep wood where evil could lurk unfettered. 
today, though, the earth's forest no long symbolize the unknowable 
dark within us. nowadays, the ogre of our nightmare descend from 
outer space or even from our inner selves, place we can't physically 
know or subdue. here, though, at this very moment, steve and sarah and 
i were maroon in a thousand-year-old forest where horror still lived. 

i got off the bed and steady myself, breathing deeply, force my 
brain to clear. steve was wearing a shift, but his clothes were hanging 
from a hook on the door. for a long moment i just stare at the bruise 
on his face. 

"god, baby, what did he do to you?" 

no answer. 

"come on, love. please wake up." 

he didn't move, but his breathing was normal, not labored. i 
immediately decided i'd slap him around if i had to, anything to get 
him go and able to walk. 

"honey, wake up. please." i pull his feet out of the bed and slid 
them around and onto the linoleum floor. i didn't know what kind of 
sedative he'd been inject with, but if i had to shake him out of it, 
fine. this was no time for half measures. "come _on_." 

i pull him to his feet and drag him across the floor to the 
slat window at the rear of the room, where the predawn sound of the 
forest beyond fill the air, mingle with the rain. what i need was 
a gallon of black coffee, but the wet breeze would have to do. 

it took ten minutes of working on him, with me barely able to hold a 
grasp on my own reality, but then his eyelid began to flutter. i kept 
talk to him, pleading and badgering, and when he finally start 
coming around, i began to walk him back and forth in front of the 
window. 

steve, i thought, i'm so sorry, so terribly sorry i drag you into 
this. 

"can i please lie down?" his timorous voice startle me, but it gave me 
a burst of hope. come _on_. 

"baby, just walk a little more. try to get the blood flowing and flush 
the damn chemical out of your brain." 

"morgy, are you okay?" his eyes had finally start to focus. and the 
first thing he ask about was _me_. i impulsive hug him. 

"i'm go to be." i pull back and examine him. "you know where you 
are?" 

he grin with only half his face, and i could tell even that hurt. 
then he stare around the room. 

"tell you one thing," he said, "this ain't kansas anymore. last thing i 
remember is, alan and i were setting down. then out of nowhere, your 
colonel ramo and about twenty kid soldier with ak-47's were all over 
us." he groaned. "they took me and then he told dupre to get back in 
the chopper and disappear. i think that son of a bitch tip ramo off 
we were coming. then ramo work me over and gave me an injection. 
about five minutes later i pass out. it's the last thing i remember." 

ramos. was he go to kill us both, now that alex goddard had gotten 
everything he wanted? i thought about it and decided this was not the 
moment to share that possibility with steve. instead i turn him 
around and lift up his head. 

"are you really awake?" i love this poor, beat-up man. more than 
anything, i just want to hold him. 

"i'm not . . . but i'd damn well better be." he try unsteadily, to 
straighten up. "morgy, before he put me away, that ramo bastard was 
talk about me, and you, in the past tense. like we'd already been 
'disappeared.' he didn't know i speak spanish. what the hell's go 
on?" 

i wasn't sure how to tell him. but i was get that super energy god 
give you when you realize life is no long a game. we had to get 
focused. 

"baby, where's your passport?" i asked. 

he look around then pointed to his batter camera bag in the corner. 

"it's in there. or was. central america. never leave home without it." 
he grimace then lightly pushed me away and stood by himself. "jesus, 
do you know what they're doing? you were right all along. they're 
sell kid in the states. that ramo prick is running the operation, 
not to mention alex goddard's slice of the action. and somebody at the 
america embassy here is handle all the paperwork, so they can grease 
everything through the ins. but i still don't understand how it is 
we're--" 

"honey, i know exactly what's happening." i'd long since figured out 
that alex goddard and colonel ramo were working hand in glove. but i 
still couldn't bring myself to tell him how he and i were go to be 
used. it was just too sick. "listen, not long from now i think i'm 
supposed to be taken down there to the village for some kind of rite, 
as part of this whole disgust operation, and then after that he's 
go to use . . . you don't want to hear. we've--" 

"you know, ramo and a bunch of g-2 thug are here to take away a batch 
of little kids," he ramble on, not seeming to hear anything i was 
saying. he was off in his own world, try to sort out things in his 
head. "but what i can't figure is, how can they just take children from 
here and nobody try to stop them? are these _indigena_ so 
terrified--?" 

"listen, please." now my hallucination were return in spite of all 
i could do, trail of light that glimmer off all the object in the 
room, and i didn't know how much long i'd be coherent. i'd have to 
talk fast. "we've got to get sarah before daylight. she's down in the 
village. i try to get her out of there yesterday, but--" 

"is she okay?" he stare at me and his eyes clear for a moment. "i 
mean, is she able to--?" 

"no, she's not okay. she's hallucinate worse than ever. i'm sure he's 
give her more drugs. really heavy stuff." 

"so how--?" 

"hopefully, we're go right this minute. there's a river. but if that 
doesn't work out, there's something i can do to buy us a month's time. 
alex goddard's got a laboratory here, just down the hall, in back of 
his office. it's the evil center of this place. so if i can get in 
there and dump all his petri dishes, his in-vitro culture medium . . . 
baby, it's all so disgusting. but i'm go to take care of it." 

i was start to have real trouble just string words together into 
sentences. my hallucination were still growing, the loud whisper of 
light, but i did manage to tell him how i thought we could get sarah 
and elude the army, if we did it before sunup, though my plan probably 
came out pretty jumbled. yet i felt that if we did it together, we 
could take care of each other. . . . 

then, with my remain strength, i launch into action. 

"let me check the hall. i just want to shut down his lab. call it . . . 
call it insurance. five minutes, and then we'll be out of here." 

it also would be a kind of justice, to even the score for what he'd 
done to sarah and to me. 

i lean steve back against the wall, then walk slow across the 
tile floor to the door and test it. surprise, surprise, it was 
locked. i again try the knob, an old one, then again, but it wouldn't 
budge, just wiggle slightly. he'd lock us in. 

now what? 

then i remember the time steve and i were in a similar situation. 
when we got lock in my room at the oloffson in port-au-prince, he'd 
just taken his switzerland army knife and unscrew the knob, then click it 
open. he'd made it look like a piece of cake, but he had a way of do 
that. 

he was barely conscious, so this time i'd have to do it myself. i 
glance around at his bag. 

"is your switzerland still in there?" 

"i think . . ." his mind seem to be wandering. then he gave a weak 
thumbs-up. 

i went over and zip it open. be there, i prayed. we really could use 
a break. 

i rummage through telephoto lens and film canister and underwear. 
then i found it, zip inside a water-repellent baggie and stuck in a 
side pouch. 

i snap it open and went to work, him watch me, his head nod 
as he struggle to stay conscious. 

the main difference between this time and haiti was, here i didn't know 
what was on the other side and i was have hallucination of 
multicolore snakes. 

"you're do great," he said finally, seeming to come a bit more alive. 

and i was. out with the screws, off with the knob, in with the small 
blade, and click. maybe we just think men's mechanical skill are 
genetic hard-wired. maybe it's all a secret plot to elicit awe. 

i closed the knife and shove it back into his bag, then turn to him. 

"honey, i'm just go to be a second. while i'm gone, practice 
walking." 

"be careful, please." he gave a cautionary wave. "they don't want us 
leave here alive." 

"just get ready." i quiet pull back the door and peer out into 
the dark hallway. it was empty, abandoned, no snakes, with only a light 
breeze flowing through. 

when i step out, the fresh air hit my face and i had a moment of 
intensity that made me realize what i really want to do, first and 
foremost, was see tz'ac tzotz one last time. a last farewell to one of 
sarah's children. stupid, yes, a private folly of the heart, but i had 
to do it. 

i was halfway down the hall, experience flash of color before my 
eyes, when i heard a voice. 

"they're all pray for you. it's almost time." 

i turn back, startled, barely able to see. finally i made out 
marcelina, in her white shift. we were standing a few feet from the 
stairs, where i want to go, and i was tripping, my reality almost 
gone. i think she knew that, because she reach out to help me stand. 

"marcelina, where's sarah?" i grasp her hand, which help me to keep 
my balance. "is she still down there in that . . . place?" 

"she's been so look forward to the ceremony. she wants them to bring 
her--" 

"you don't know where she is?" i realize nothing was go to go the 
way i'd hope it would. 

"they all love her. they're taking good care of her." 

"well, i love her too. and i have to get her. now." i was whisper to 
her, try to save my strength. "marcelina, promise me you'll stop all 
this. it's so horrible. so sad." 

"it's our life," she whisper back, then turn her face away. 

i didn't know what else to say, and i was terrify alex goddard might 
materialize, so without another word, i pull away and start up the 
steps. 

when i reach the top of the stairs, the hallway was light by the 
string of bulb along the floor, and i made my way as fast as i could 
to my room at the end. i pull my passport out of my bag, along with a 
charge card, slip them both into my pants pocket, and head back 
down the hall. 

when i got to the door of the room where tz'ac tzotz and his mother 
were, i gave it a gentle push and peer in, but the glow from the lamp 
above the bed show it and the crib were both empty. . . . 

no! they must have already taken the children. next they'd be coming 
for me. i realize i'd been a fool not to head straight for the lab. i 
should have just gone-- 

the room went completely dark, together with the hallway, a pitch-black 
that felt like a liquid washing over me. the main power, somewhere, had 
abrupt died, or been deliberate shut off. 

then i heard a thunder of footstep pounding up the steps, hard boots 
on the marble. 

i made a dash, hope to slip past them in the dark hall. 

i'd reach the top of the stairs when i felt a hand brush against my 
face, then a grip circle around my biceps. somebody had been too quick. 

i brought my elbow around hope to catch him in the face, bring him 
down, but instead it slam against something metal, which clatter 
onto the floor. 

"_chingado_!" came a muffle voice. 

i drew back and swung, and this time my arm scrape hard against the 
flesh of a face and the bastard stagger backward his grip loosening. 

i twist away and drop to the floor to begin searching for what had 
fallen. surely it was a pistol. 

the marble was cold against my bare arms as i swept my hand across the 
floor. then i ran my finger down the edge of the stair. 

and there it was, on the first step. my left hand closed around the 
cold barrel of an automatic. i shift it to my right, grasping the 
plastic grip, not entire sure what i should do with it. but at least 
i had a gun. i'd never actually held a real one before, but it was 
heavy and i assume it was ready to fire. 

i was halfway down the first set of stairs, on my way to the landing, 
when i felt an arm slip around my neck. i duck and twist away, 
stumble down the last three or four steps, and landed on my feet, 
staggering back against the wall to regain my balance. all i knew was, 
the next steps loom somewhere to my right. just a few more feet . . . 

but he was there again, moving between me and the final stairs. get 
around him, i told myself, but at that moment he grab me at the 
waist. 

dance in the dark, but the swirl had no music and no swing, just a 
quick, dizzy pirouette. i aim the pistol as close as i could to 
his face and pull the hard metal trigger. 

"_mierda!_" 

blind light, a face lost in the burst of flame, stars filling my 
head. the fiery explosion tongue out past his ear like a brilliant 
sword of red and yellows, send a round off into space. the noise 
left a ring in my ear and multicolore hue stutter across my 
eyes. 

it hit me who i'd just seen. it was ramos. with a gun! shit. 

the flash of my pistol had given me the advantage for a second, since i 
knew it was coming, and with that edge i swung an elbow across his 
chin, then knee him in the groin. it should have been enough to bring 
him down, but instead he merely sank to one knee and redouble his grip. 

hey, i thought, maybe i know something he doesn't. how to take a fall. 
i'd seen enough movie stunt to know what you're supposed to do. it'd 
be risky, but i knew i wasn't go to win a wrestle match. 

i open up with the automatic, fire everywhere again and again and 
again, get off five rounds in a crescendo of light and sound, like 
a huge firecracker in my hand, enough to illuminate the stairwell like 
a strobe and catch him off guard. in that fleeting moment i slip a 
foot behind his ankle and shoved. 

i think i yell as i felt myself being pull forward. then i realize 
he was wearing a heavy bracelet that had tangle in my hair. i'd been 
plan to roll down the remain stairs, protect my head, and let 
him bounce, but the pull of his bracelet ruin it. i felt myself being 
swept into empty space, my gun flying away. 

then something glance off my face, the wooden banister of the stair, 
which had mysterious come up to meet me. i turn and felt his body 
beneath mine, arms flailing, a soft landing, till we roll and i was 
beneath him again. 

i struck out, a right fist, and he fell away, his bracelet 
disentangle as he tumble farther down the stairs. then i rose and 
try to take a step, but it wasn't there. in the pitch dark the angle 
was wrong, off by just inches, and as i topple forward into empty 
space i reach out, taking a handful of dark air. 

finally i felt something clench my wrist, and the next 

thing i knew i was being swung around. i twist sideways one last 
time, but then my head hit the wall. the hard marble caught me just 
above the ear, and i saw the dark of the space grow brilliant 
light, then transmute to vibrant colors. 

or maybe the hall lights had come back on. i only know i felt a set of 
arms encircle me. 

"come," alex goddard was saying as he lift me up. "they're ready." 




chapter twenty-eight 


when we reach the parking lot, several more army thug were waiting, 
grown-ups now, khaki shirt and dense mustaches, the regulation g-2 
sunglasses even though it was still dark, with 9mm automatic in 
holster at their belt. i took one look at them and i think i black 
out. steve and i were about to "disappear," and possibly sarah too. 
probably in another hour or two. my tattered mind finally just slip 
away. 

soon afterward, i sense myself being transport in a large vehicle, 
and after that i was being carried, up, up, as though i were floating 
into the coming dawn. when i regain consciousness, i realize i was 
standing in a rainstorm near a small stone building. a dozen army men 
were huddle inside, shield their cigarette from the blow rain 
while they guarded a row of olive-green bassinets. around me, censer 
were spew _copal_ smoke into the soggy air. 

i became aware of the cool sensation of the fresh rain across my 
face, and wonder if it might clear some of the toad venom (surely 
that was what it was) from my brain. maybe it was working. instead of 
seeing vivid colors everywhere, i was abrupt experience a hyper 
acute clarity of every sensation. the stone beneath my bare feet were 
becoming so articulated, i felt as though i could number every granule, 
every crystal, every atom. the painting and carving on the lintel 
above the door to the stone room--i recognize it as where i'd spent 
the first night--sparkled, leapt out at me. 

"stand there on the edge of the platform," alex goddard commanded, 
urge me forward. it was only then i realize we'd come up the back 
steps of the pyramid, where the g-2 men had park their black land 
rovers, unnoticed and ready. 

look down at the crowd of people gather in the square, i realize 
they couldn't really see much of what was go on atop the pyramid. to 
them it was just a cloud of _copal_ smoke and foggy rain. although the 
sun was start to brighten the east, the only real light still came 
from the torch station around the plaza. 

then like a ghost materialize out of the mist, marcelina move up the 
steep front steps, leading a line of maya mother from the clinic--i 
count twelve--each carry her newborn, the "special" baby she would 
give back to kukulkan, perhaps the way abraham of the old testament 
offer up his son isaac in sacrifice to jehovah. it was a sight i 
shall never forget, the sad but also the unmistakable reverence in 
their eyes. i want to yell at them to run, to take sarah's votive 
baby and disappear into the forest, but i didn't have the words. 

next the women array themselves in a line across the front of the 
pyramid, facing not the crowd below, but toward alex goddard and me. 
then, holding out a jade-handled obsidian knife, he walk down the 
line, allow each woman to touch her forehead against its flint 
blade. i assume each one believe it was the instrument that would 
take her child's life, ceremonial send it back to the maya 
otherworld whence it came. had he drug them too, i fleeting 
wondered, hypnotize them or given them some potion to prevent them 
from comprehend what was really go on? 

i kept remember . . . a hundred other insane episode of immortal 
yearning leading to a mass "transport" to some other "plane." this, i 
thought, must be what it was like in the jungle of jonestown that 
death-filled morning. and alex goddard was their "jim jones," the 
spiritual leader of the moral travesty he'd impose upon the lost 
village of baalum. 

i was go to stop it, somehow. by god, i was. i stare at the women 
and felt so sad at the sight of the hand-woven blanket they held their 
baby in, primary greens and red and blues loving woven into 
shimmer pattern that mirror the symbol across the side of the 
stone room. their faces, especially their eyes, were transcendent in a 
kind of chiaroscuro of darkest black and purest whites, as though all 
their humanity had been caught by their blanket and shawls, surely 
create for this ultimate moment. and the mother of tz'ac tzotz was 
there, carry him, the baby i'd so want to hold one last time. 

next alex goddard emerge from the stone room bearing a basket fill 
with sheet of white bark-paper. he approach tz'ac tzotz's mother, 
then took a wide section of the paper and secure it around her face 
with a silk cord, covering her vision. down the line, one after 
another, he careful blindfold the women, while they stood 
passively, some crying--from joy or sorrow, i could not tell. finally, 
at the last, he also cover marcelina's face. 

so she's not supposed to know what's really happening. nobody's 
supposed to know except him, and me. and, of course, ramo and the g-2 
secret police and whoever else is in on this crime. but, secretly, she 
do know. the god of the house of darkness. 

when he finished, he put down the basket, then turn to me. "stand at 
the front edge of the platform and lift your hand in benediction. they 
all want to see you, the new bride." 

i took a couple of steps, then look back to see him add more 
_copal_ to the main censer, send a fresh cloud of smoke billow 
out into the rain. as the incense pour around us, the army thug 
who'd been loiter at the back of the stone room began coming 
forward, each carry one of the bassinets. they set them down on the 
stones, ready to start taking the children. my outrage mind flash on 
ghirlandajo's "massacre of the innocents." here, though, sarah's 
children weren't being stab to death; they were being--kidnapped and 
stolen. 

revulsion pierce through me as though i'd been hit by a jagged shaft 
of lightning, but instead of being knock down, i was energized. or 
maybe the final effects of the toad venom were give me a spurt of 
adrenaline. letting his criminal charade continue one second long 
became unbearable. what would happen to me, i didn't know, but i 
couldn't let it go on. 

"no," i yelled, startle myself by the sound of my own voice. "in 
god's name, stop." 

the rain was grow more intense, and i was soaked and bleary-eyed, 
but before i could think i found myself stalk over to tz'ac tzotz's 
mother, shouting at her. the next thing i knew i was rip the paper 
from her frightened eyes. i hug her as best i could, then yell 
back at marcelina. 

"tell them all to take off their blindfolds. this is obscene." 

then i went on autopilot, shut out everything around me--the rain, 
the perilous side of the pyramid, the pistol-carrying g-2 thugs, even 
alex goddard. the way i remember it now, it all took place in slow 
motion, like some underwater dream sequence, but surely it was just the 
opposite. 

anyway, i do know i snapped. i start shouting again, and with the g-2 
hood momentarily frozen, i start fling the still-empty bassinet 
down the steep side of the pyramid, where they just bounce away into 
the rain. as i watch them disappearing, one after another, i felt 
marvelous emboldened. i would throw one and watch it go flying, and 
then i would throw another. yes, damn it, yes! 

i want to show anybody with two eyes that it was all a sham. once 
they realize what was really happening, surely they would rise up and 
drive alex goddard from their home. 

for a moment it seem to be working. a stun silence was slow 
spread over the square, while everybody around me was paralyzed, 
like waxworks. maybe it's the same way you're temporary caught off 
guard when a stranger on the street go berserk. 

by the time i'd flung away the last bassinet, the women had all remove 
their blindfold and were staring at me, dumbfounded. finally, tz'ac 
tzotz's mother whisper something to marcelina, and she turn to me. 

"she wants to know why you're angry. you're the bride. they only want 
to please you." 

angry? i was terrified, but also fight mad. 

"marcelina, this is all a ghastly lie." i'd finished throw and i was 
moving to the next stage. get control. could he risk killing me in 
front of all these people? "tell them to take their baby and hide in 
the forest." 

that was when i heard a cry that pierce through the rain and across 
the square beyond, and i turn back to see alex goddard shove toward 
me. he's coming to murder me, since i've expose him. but i wouldn't 
let it happen without a fight. i clench my fists, waiting, feeling my 
adrenaline surge. 

instead, though, he just brush past me, head toward the edge of the 
platform. at first i didn't know why, but he was intent on something 
off in the mist, his open hand thrust up at the rainy skies. 

that was when i heard the guatemala army hood yell curses. 

"_vete ala chingada!_" 

they also were staring off to the south, in the same direction. 

hadn't they notice i'd just dismantle their sick pageant? i want a 
reaction that would drive home the truth to marcelina, to the mothers, 
to everyone. 

"damn it, look at me," i yelled, first at him and then at the g-2 
thugs. "_mira!_" but their focus still was on something beyond the 
square. 

finally i turned, following their gaze, and for a second i too forgot 
all about everything else. an intense red glow was illuminating the 
morning sky from the direction of the clinic, a vibrant electric rose 
weave its hue in the mist. then i saw spew spike of flame, 
orange and yellow, dance over the top of the clinic. there was a 
finality about it that momentarily took my breath away. 

then it hit me. steve's in there. it was a horror that, in my initial 
shock, i couldn't actually process, the thought just hover in the 
recess of my brain defy me to accept it. 

then alex goddard turn back, shouting at the army men in rapid 
spanish--i recognize the word for fire--that galvanize them to 
action. they snap out of their mental paralysis and head down the 
pyramid, toward two land rover park at the back. 

next he turn around and fixed his gaze on me. at last he knew / knew 
he was capable of unspeakable evil, and i knew he knew i would do 
everything in my power to stop him. 

"all my records." his voice sound as though it was coming from 
another world, and it held a sad that touched even me. "you have no 
idea what's been lost." 

he was distraught, but also obsessed. with his wild mane of hair, he 
did, finally, look like shiva the destroyer. he stalk over and seize 
the obsidian knife, then turn toward me. 

i look for something to defend myself with. the bassinets, which i 
might have use as a shield were gone. i only had my bare hands. 

i had to get away from him, get down the pyramid and find sarah and 
steve. but as i start toward the front steps, the women were all 
cluster there, block my way. 

then, for no reason i could understand the mother of tz'ac tzotz 
step out of the group and hand me her baby, saying something in 
kekchi maya and reach to touch my cheek. 

i was so startle i took the bundle that was sarah's child. but then i 
thought, no! alex goddard will just kill him too. 

"she said he must not harm you," marcelina whisper moving beside me. 
"you are the special one. she wants you to give her child back to 
kukulkan." 

she still believes, i realized. they all do. 

holding tz'ac tzotz, my eyes fixed on alex goddard, i'd entire fail 
to notice a new presence on the pyramid a ghostlike waif in a white 
shift who now stood silent in the doorway of the stone room. sarah! 

marcelina had said she'd want to come for the ceremony. she was being 
help to stand by the two maya women who'd fed me the _atole_. 
somehow, she'd gotten them to bring her. 

"morgy, are you there?" sarah ask gaze up at the rainy skies, the 
downpour soaking her blond hair, her eyes unblinking. at that moment, i 
felt we'd join become one person--me the dogged rational half who'd 
just gone over the line, her the spiritual part that need to float, 
to fly free. "i want to be with--" 

"sar, get back," i yell and start to go to her, but there wasn't 
time. now alex goddard was moving toward me holding the knife, as 
though track a prey, oblivious to sarah, to everything. he'd 
concentrated all his hatred on me and me alone, and i hate him back as 
much. death hover between us, wait to see whom to take. 

but then the woman who had borne tz'ac tzotz said something in kekchi 
maya, point back at me and her child, and lunge at him. they 
collide together in the rain and next she slid down, first seize his 
leg, then lose her grip and slip onto the stones, her long black 
hair askew in the hover smoke. 

she's try to save me, i realized. why--? 

then i saw sarah pull away from the women support her and slow 
move across the platform. 

"morgy . . ." 

she was walking in the direction of alex goddard, but then she stumble 
over the fallen woman's leg and her hand went down as she sprawl 
across her. she must have touched something, because she recoil 
backward, and only then did i notice the flare of a torch glint off 
the obsidian knife now protrude from the woman's chest. 

sarah rose up, her eyes full of anger, and awkward flung her arms, 
searching. i could feel the passion that had been pent up all those 
month she lay in the coma, feed her madness. she manage to catch 
hold of alex goddard's arm, and they began an awkward minuet, neither 
realize how close they were to the stone platform's edge. i stood 
mesmerize a moment, then dashed toward them, but only in time to watch 
them vanish into the rain and haze. it was as though there had been 
some sleight of hand. one second they were there and the next they 
weren't. at first i thought my eyes were play trick on me, but then 
i realize it was real. they were gone. 

"_sarah!_" 

i reach the side in time to see them land on the first tier of stone 
below. she'd fallen near the edge, but she was solid and safe. alex 
goddard, however, hit with one foot on and one foot off, and the result 
was he slid away, then vanish into the dark rain. 

it's her final act of self-destruction. she's join me in my rage, but 
we've both been spared. that's the miracle of _baalum_. 

"sar, don't move." i finally found my voice. i was still holding tz'ac 
tzotz, who'd begun to shriek, his blue eyes flood with fear. 

now several village men from the square were running, shouting, up the 
slippery steps. their face look like they'd been paint at one 
time, but now the rain had wash most of it away. 

while i yell down to sarah, again beg her not to move, marcelina 
was ask them something, and their answer were tumble out. 

finally i turn to look at her, the scream tz'ac tzotz still in my 
arms. 

"no one know where he is," she was saying as she look down over the 
side. "he's gone into the forest." 

"good." i pull tz'ac tzotz to me and kiss him, try to tell him 
to calm down. it wasn't working. 

"marcelina, here, please hold him. i've got to get down to sarah." 

she took him. then i walk over to where his mother lay bleeding on 
the stones. the woman wasn't moving, the obsidian knife still 
protrude from her chest. she'd save me, but now death had taken her. 
there was nothing anyone could do. 

i was trembling, but i turn and began ease myself over the side of 
the stone platform and onto the first tier of the pyramid. 

"sar, don't move." i inch my way across to her. "just 

stay still." the rain was pour again, but the electric bloom of 
sparks and flame from the direction of the clinic was unabated. it 
would be completely gutted. was steve awake enough to get out? he'd 
seem alert when i left him. 

"morgy, is that you?" she was holding out her fingers. "i can't see 
you. where are--?" 

"i'm here, sar. right here." i reach down and took her hand, which 
was deathly cold. "come on. let me help you get up." 

carefully, leaning against the wet stone of the side of the pyramid, i 
gradual pull her to her feet and away from the treacherous edge. 
then it hit me what she'd said. 

"sar, what do you mean, you can't see me?" 

"i'm okay. it's just . . ." she was gripping my hand now, and then she 
brush against the stone side of the pyramid and put out her other 
hand to cling to it. "morgy, i took it again. to go to their sacred 
place. but sometimes you can only see vision and then after a while 
everything go blank." 

that bastard. alex goddard had given her the drug again. now she was 
lost in a world of colored lights, a place i'd just traveled through 
myself. she probably had no idea she'd just pushed him off the pyramid 
and into the dark. 

"your hand feel so soft," she was saying. "you're like warm honey." 

"sar, try to walk. we're go to turn a corner and then we'll be at 
the back of the pyramid. next we'll come to some steps, and then we're 
go down." 

as i inch our way along, scarcely able to keep our footing because of 
the rain, i wonder again about steve. please, god, let him be all 
right. 

when we finally got to the steps, marcelina was there, standing 
expectantly, holding tz'ac tzotz. he was still crying, intermittent 
sobs. 

"he belong to you now," she said, holding him out for me. "it's what 
she wished. 

"what--?" i took him before i realize what i was doing. 

as i cradle him, gaze down at his tender little face, i realize he 
truly was sarah all over again. and i was so glad she couldn't see him. 
never, i thought, she must never, ever know. 

i finally forced myself to place him back into marcelina's arms. 

"you've got no idea how much i want him, but i can't. let one of these 
women give him her milk, have a twin for her own child." 

for that wrench moment i'd held the very baby my heart long for. 
but he was the last one on earth i could have. just go, take sarah and 
find steve and go as far from _baalum_ as you can, before you lose your 
compass and do something terribly selfish. 

"marcelina," i said, reach to hug her, "tell them these 'sacred' 
children are all from his _medico_. look up 'in vitro' in your 
dictionary. that's all it is." 

she hug me back, though i wasn't sure whether she understood. then i 
ask her to take sarah's hand for a moment while i went back up the 
steps to the platform. i felt a primal anger as i took one last look at 
the women alex goddard had wronged, now cluster around the body of 
tz'ac tzotz's mother. then i bade them a silent farewell, turned, and 
walked, holding my tears, back through the stone room. 

the rear of the pyramid was deserted, the steps slippery and dangerous, 
but it was our way out. i began leading sarah down, step by treacherous 
step. everything had happen so fast i'd barely had time to think 
about steve. those flames, my god. it was finally sink in, truly 
hit me. had he gotten out in time? 

then the slimy rio tigre, now swelling from the rain, came into view. i 
stare at it a second before i notice the three young army recruit 
leaning against the trunk of a giant cebia tree next to the trail, 
their rifles cover in plastic against the rain. when they saw us, 
they stiffened, shift their weapons, and glance up at the top of the 
pyramid, as though seek orders. neither group had any idea why the 
other was there. sarah and i were an unforeseen contingency they hadn't 
been brief on. 

what are they go to do? they have no idea what just happened. 

"morgy," sarah said, gaze blank at the sky, "the colors are so 
beautiful. can we--?" 

"shhh, we'll talk in a minute." 

i smile and nod and began walking past the young privates, holding 
my breath. then a spectral form emerge out of the rain just behind 
them. 

it took me a moment to recognize who it was. i was hope it might be 
steve, but instead it was a man dress in white, now cover with mud, 
and holding a knife, not obsidian this time but long and steel. his 
eyes were glazed, and i wasn't sure if he even knew exactly where he 
was. why had he come down to the river? had he known i'd come here, too? 

for a moment we just stood staring at each other, while the army 
private began edging up the hill, as though not wanting to witness 
what surely was coming next. 

"why don't you put an end to all the evil?" i yell at him finally, 
try to project through the rain. "just stop it right now." 

"_baalum_ was my life's work," he said. then he look down at the 
knife a moment, as though unsure what it was. finally he turn and 
flung it in the direction of the river. 

"it could have been beautiful," i said back. thank god the knife was 
gone. but what would he do next? "but now--" 

"no," he said staring directly at me, his eyes seeming to plead. "it 
is. it will be again. to make a place like _baalum _is to coin the 
riches of god. i want you to stay. to be part of it. together, we . . 
." but whatever else he said was lost in the cloudburst that abrupt 
swept over the embankment. in an instant it was a torrent, the last 
outpoure of the storm, powerful and unrelenting. nature had unleash 
its worst, as though kukulkan was rendering his final judgment. 

"morgy, i'm falling," sarah screamed. the ground she and i had been 
standing on began turning to liquid as though it were a custard melting 
in the tropical heat. as we began slip down the embankment toward 
him, i grip her arm with my left hand and reach up to seize a 
low-lying branch of the cebia with my right. 

then, under the weight of the water, all the soil beneath us gave way, 
ton of wet riverbank that abrupt buckle outward. 

alex goddard made no sound as the mass of earth lift him backward 
toward the river. his sully garb of white blend into the gray 
sludge of mud and rain, then fade to dark as the embankment 
dissolve into the swirl rio tigre. 

"sar, hold on. please hold on." i felt my grasp of the tree slipping, 
but now the mud slide had begun to stabilize. 

i manage to cling to the limb for a few seconds more, the bark cutting 
into my fingers, and then my hold slip away, send us both 
spiral downward till we were temporary snag by the cebia's 
newly expose undergrowth. i still had her hand though just barely, but 
the torrent of rain and mud was subsiding, and finally we collapse 
together into the gnarled network of roots. 

after a moment's rest, i manage to crawl out and pull her up. 

"come on, sar. try and walk." 

together we stumble and slid down the last incline before the river's 
edge, then turn upstream along the bank. after about fifty yards, 
sure enough, the native _cayucos_, the hollowed-out mahogany canoe i'd 
told steve about, were still there just as i'd seen them that first 
morning, bob and strain at their moorings. in the rain i 
couldn't tell how use they were, but i figured go downriver was 
the only way we'd ever be able to get out. we'd have to flee the way 
sarah had that first time. 

for a moment i thought they all were empty--dear god, no--but then i 
realize there was a drench figure in the last one in the row. when i 
recognize who it was, i think i completely lost it; all the horror of 
the last two days swallow me up. i grab sarah and hug her for 
dear life, feeling the tear coursing down my cheeks. i literally 
couldn't help myself. 

"they were tie up here just like you said." steve wipe the rain from 
his eyes, then reach to take my hand. his bandage nose was bleeding 
again, and he look like he'd just been half killed. "i told those 
little army _chicos_ i was a big amigo of _el doctor _and they salute 
and show me where these were tie up." 

"thank god you're okay. what happened? did--?" 

"ramos, the son of a bitch. he came in and ... i guess it was time to 
finish me off. but i wasn't as drug out as he thought." he was 
staring at sarah, clearly relieved but ask no questions. "i brought 
along his nine-millimeter"--he indicate the silver automatic in his 
belt--"in case we run into problems." 

i want to kiss him, but i was still too shaken up. instead i focus 
on helping sarah in without capsize everything. 

after i'd settled her, i pull myself over the side and reach for a 
paddle. 

"if we go with the current," i said, "we'll get to the usumacinta. 
hopefully the flood will help push us downstream." 

"honestly, i didn't think the fire would get away from me like it did." 
he shove off amidst the swirl debris. "jesus. i heard them taking 
you away, and i assume you didn't get to mess up his lab. so i figured 
there was one way . . . i just threw around some ether and pitch a 
match. the place was empty, so . . ." 

i look around at the roile waters, snake and crocodile lurking, 
and felt a lifetime of determination. was alex goddard still alive? i 
no long cared. . . . 

sunrise was break through the last of the rain, lay dance 
shadow on the water as we row for midstream. someday, i knew, what 
was real about _baalum _and what i'd dream here might well merge 
together, the way they had for sarah. but for now, true daylight never 
look better. 




chapter twenty-nine 


we got picked up by a ragged crew of mexico fishermen just before 
dark. aside from being sunburn to medium rare, we were physically 
okay. the fresh air and sunshine did a lot to bring sarah back, though 
she did have lapse of non-rationality, and once try to dive over the 
side of their fishing cutter. they drop us off at the tourist site 
of yaxchitan, a mayan ruin on the western bank of the mighty 
usumacinta, where we join an america day-tour on its way back to san 
cristobal de las casas. there we caught a prop flight to cancun, and 
then america airline to new york. we had no luggage, but i flew us 
first-class, and i still have the mastercard slip to prove it. 

as things turn out, though, return sarah to normalcy--or me, for 
that matter--was another struggle entirely. for me, time, after that 
rainy morning in the peten, became an essence that flow around me as 
though i were aswim in the ether of interstellar space, ponder the 
conjunction of good and evil. i suffer flashbacks, late-night 
reverie of forest and children that must have been like those sarah 
struggle to bury. for week after that, i had a lot of trouble 
remember meetings, return phone calls, give david an honest 
day's editing. 

for her own part, sarah just seem to drift at first, to the point i 
sometimes wonder if she realize she was back at lou's loft. then 
abruptly, one day she snap into her old self and start send for 
re-registration material from columbia. i really need to talk with 
her about our mutual nightmare, but she seem to have erase all 
memory of _baalum_, except for occasional mumble in kekchi maya. 
perhaps that was best, i console myself. maybe it was wise for us all 
just to let the ghost of that faraway place lie sleeping. 

as for lou, i told him as little as i could about what happen to her 
there. he hadn't return to work, had mainly stay at his soho place 
to be near her, as though he was fearful she might be snatch away 
from him once more. frankly, i think all his enforce close was 
start to grate on her nerves, though i dare not hint such a thing 
to him. 

in the meantime, steve return to belize to wrap up his photo essay, 
and david submit a (very) rough cut of _baby love _to the selection 
committee at sundance (our hoped-for distribution deal with ore was, 
alas, in temporary turnaround pending yet another management shuffle). 
we did, however, squeeze an advance from lifetime that lower the heat 
with nicky russo. 

nevertheless, the story of how alex goddard touched all our lives still 
wasn't over. it was two month after we got back to the city that my 
dark dance with the man who thought he was shiva, creator and 
destroyer, had its final pirouette, as though his ghost had return 
from his rain-forest redoubt for one last sorcerer's turn. 

truthfully, it all transpire so fast i could scarcely take it in, but 
here's the rough outline of what happened. i was working late that 
thursday evening in the edit room at applecore, around seven 
o'clock. and i was feeling particularly out of sorts, including a 
headache and stomach pains from the leftover pizza i'd microwave to 
keep me going. i was re-cutting some new real-life interview i'd 
film to replace those of car and paula. (children of light had gone 
defunct, by the way, the phone at quetzal manor disconnected, but i 
didn't need any more excitement in my life of the colonel ramo 
variety. the replacement interview weren't nearly as bubbly and full 
of exuberance, but they were actually much true to the reality of 
adoption.) 

anyway, i listen to my stomach, and decided it was high time to toss 
in the towel. i got my things, lock up, and then i ran into david on 
the elevator, coming down from the floor above. 

"how's it going?" he asked, ostentatious check his watch, an 
approve gleam in his eyes. i was glad he want to let me know he'd 
notice i was log long hours. then he look at me again. "hey, you 
feeling okay?" 

"i've been better," i said, thinking how nice it was that he cared. 
"could be a couple of aspirin and a good night's sleep are call for." 

"so now you're a doctor?" he said, following me into the lobby, 
"providing self-diagnosis--?" 

"david, give me a break. i just happen to feel a little off today, 
okay? it doesn't mean i'm at death's door." 

"yeah, well, the way you look you coulda fool me." he head down the 
street, toward the avenue. then he call back over his shoulder. "i 
don't want to see you in tomorrow unless you look like you might live 
through the day. i pay for your health insurance. use it, for god's 
sake." 

after i found a cab, i began to think he might be right. this was no 
typical down day. so i decided i'd stop at the duane reade on my corner 
and talk to the pharmacist. 

the second-shift man was on, a gray-haired portly old guy who knew more 
about drug than most doctors. the tag on his jacket said "bernd" and 
that's all anybody ever knew of his name. i sometimes call him "dr. 
bernd" by way of banter, but nothing i could do would ever make him 
smile. 

the place was nearly empty and the pharmacy at the rear, with its 
spectral fluorescent lighting, look like an out-take from a 
low-budget we craven movie. bernd, who was in back puttering, came out 
and look me over. 

i know it sound naive, but i trust him more than i trust half the 
young, overwork intern you get at an emergency room these days. i 
pour out my symptoms, including the story about how i'd been given 
fertility drug and toad venom. was it all coming back to haunt me, the 
dark hand of alex goddard? 

he began by ask me some very perceptive questions, about things that 
had been puzzle me but i'd sort of manage to dismiss. finally, he 
walk around the counter and lift a small, shrink-wrapped box off a 
rack. 

"try this," he said hand it over, "and then come back tomorrow. 
maybe it's not such a big deal." 

you're kidding, i thought, look at the box. 

i got home, collapse onto the couch, and open it. believe it or not, 
i actually had to read the instructions. i did what they said, checked 
the time, and then decided to run a hot bath. 

i fill the tub, dump in some bubble-bath, put the cordless on the 
toilet seat, and splash in. it felt so good i want to dissolve. 
then i reach for the phone. 

the clock above the sink read eight-thirty, and i figured rightly, that 
steve would be back at his hotel in belize city. sure enough i got him 
on the first try. 

"honey, you sitting down?" i said. 

"i'm lie down. you wouldn't believe my day." 

"you 're not go to believe what i just heard from the pharmacist at 
the corner. remember i told you i've been feeling strange, and some 
things were a little behind schedule? well, guess what. we're about to 
find out something. we can't be together, but we can share it over a 
satellite." 

"you mean . . ." 

"i'm do the test right now. you know, you take the stick out of the 
glass holder and if it's turn pink. . . ." 

he was speechless for a long moment. finally he just said, "wow." 

i checked the clock again, then reach for the test tube. this, i 
realized, is the most incredible moment in any woman's life. is your 
world go to go on being the same, or is it never, ever go to be 
the same again? 

when i pull out the stick, it was a bright, beautiful pink. 

"steve. i love you. it's--" 

"max." he didn't realize it, but his voice had just gone up an octave. 

"what?" 

"that's my dad's middle name. i want to name him max. it's an old 
family tradition." 

"and what if it's a girl? don't say maxine or i'll divorce you before 
you even make an honest woman of me." 

"nope. if it's a girl, then you get to pick." 

i couldn't believe i was finally have this conversation. it was 
something i'd dream of for years. 

it then got too maudlin to repeat. he was coming home in eleven days, 
and we plan the celebration. dinner at le cirque and then an evening 
at cafe carlyle. for a couple of would-be new york sophisticates, that 
was about as fancy-schmancy as this town gets. 

i was crying tear of triumph by the time we hung up. by then it was 
late enough i figured arlene would be home from her exercise class, so 
i decided to call her and break the happy news once more. who i really 
want to call was betsy, on the coast, but i knew she'd still be 
driving home from her temp job. arlene would have to do. telling her 
would be the equivalent of send an urgent e-mail to the entire 
office, but i want everybody to know. two bird with one stone. 

i look down at my body, all the curve and soft skin, and try to 
think about the miracle of a baby finally grow inside it, life 
recreate itself. god! 

arlene was go to break my mood, but for some reason i had to call 
her. if only to bring me back to reality. 

i reach over and click open the cordless again. i was punch in 
her number when something made me pause. it was a nag thought that 
i'd manage to repress for a while. finally, though, it wouldn't stay 
down any more. there was something i had to check out. 

i slow put down the handset, climb out of the tub, dry off, then 
plod into the bedroom to dig out my private calendar, which had long 
since become a record of everything relevant to my and steve's baby 
project. 

it was bury at the bottom of the desk's second drawer, in amongst old 
bank statements. it was also, figuratively, cover by two month of 
dust, since that was how long it'd been since i'd bother with it. i 
guess my attitude had been, what's the point? 

i placed it on the desk, try not to get it wet. then i wrap the 
towel more firm around me, switch on the desk lamp, and sat down. i 
think i was also holding my breath. 

i count all the days twice, but there was no mistaking. the night 
steve and i had spent so glorious together in the camino real wasn't 
a fertile time. not even close. i suppose that by then i'd become so 
despairing of ever get pregnant, i hadn't even given it any 
thought. it was enough just to see him and hold him. 

i just sat there for a long time staring at the white page, unable to 
move, random thought coming too fast to contain inside my tangle 
brain. finally, though, i manage to get up 

and numbly put the calendar away. order, i need order. i then work 
my way into the kitchen to fix myself something. i had a glass of 
water, then pull down a bottle of red label and pour myself half a 
tumbler. okay, somewhere down deep i knew it was the worst possible 
thing i could do, but i wasn't thinking, just go on autopilot and 
dismay. 

i drank off a shot of the foul-tasting scotch, then realize how 
thoughtless that was and dump the rest into the sink. next, i move 
into the living room and put on a raga, "malkauns," concert volume, the 
one where the first note go straight to your heart. finally i 
collapse onto the couch, the room now glorious alive with all the 
spirituality and sensuality of the raga, note pile on exquisite 
notes. for a while i just lay there numbly, envelop in its lush 
eroticism. . . . 

eventually i start to think. alex goddard had plan to take from 
me, but had he also given? had his "proprietary" ovulate drug . . . 
cause all those hundred of egg to mature simultaneous . . . 
inadvertent let me get pregnant? 

then i had a dismay counter-thought. could he have done an _in 
vitro_ while i was under sedation, when he harvest my ova? the 
ultimate link to _baalum_. was my baby sarah's too? one of those last 
frozen embryo in his . . .? 

then i lean back and closed my eyes. 

no, surely not. this baby was steve's and mine. ours. had to be. his 
unintended, beautiful, ironic gift. 

surely . . . 

uh-uh. go for a second take. embrace life. be mol bloom and shout it. 

yes! 

_yes_!
