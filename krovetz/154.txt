chapter ix. 

of the influence of the fixed stars 

the fixed stars are so call because they appear to keep at the same 

distance from one another in the heavens. all of these stars have their 

respective influence analogous to those of the planets. the following 

table of the principal fixed stars, with their several magnitude and 

natures, will be found useful. it is only those of the first and second 

magnitude which much affect us; the influence of those stars marked as 

of fourth magnitude is very slight. the time of the rising and setting 

of the fixed stars vary according to the latitudes of the place of 

observation. their longitude increase at the annual rate of 50 

seconds, but their latitudes vary very little. the right ascension and 

declination of the numerous fixed stars are given every year in the 

nautical almanack.

to know when any of these fixed stars will affect the horoscope we must 

note the sign and degree on the cusp of the houses, and if (on 

consulting the ephemeris) any of these stars should be found to be 

ascend or descend within five degree of the sign upon the cusp 

of the several houses, they must be enter in the same manner as the 

planets, and their quality weigh according to the nature of the 

planet or planet with which they correspond, as shown by the table 

given.
