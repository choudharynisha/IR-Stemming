jewish or ancient christianity. 

it is our purpose to present the evidence showing 

that a system of astral worship, which we designate as 

jewish christianity, was in existence more than two 

century and a half before the institution of its 

modern form. in verify of this assertion we must 

find the initial point of our inquiry in ancient history, 

which teach that in the division of the grecian empire 

among his generals, after the death of alexander the 

great, who die 332 years before the beginning of our era, 

the governorship of egypt and adjacent provinces was secure 

by ptolemy lagus, or soter, who, have subsequent 

suppress a revolt in judea, remove from that 

country a large body of its inhabitant to people the new 

city of alexandria, which had been laid out by order of 

and name after the great conqueror. 

the egypt version of the gospel story, being 

more appropriate to the nile valley than to the region 

from whence they came, the greece colonist of alexandria 

adopt it, but prefer to pay homage to serapis, 

one of the ninth incarnation of god sol, which they 

import from pontus, a greece province of asia minor, 

they erect to his worship that celebrated temple known 

as the grand serapium; and, transfer the culture and 

refinement of greece to the new city, it became, under the 

ptolemian dynasty, a great seat of learning; the arts and 

science flourished, an immense library was collected, the 

various form of astral worship were represent and 

school for the disseminate of the several phase of grecian 

philosophy and oriental gnostic were founded. 

such being the environment of the jewish resident 

of alexandria, they soon acquire the vernacular and 

adopt the religion of the greeks, who, have ever attach 

to their incarnate saviour the title signify the 

christ, or the anointed, were known as christians. encourage 

by the liberal policy of philadelphus, the second 

ptolemy, a body of their learned men, who had been educated 

in the greece schools, found a college for the education 

of their own people, which institution was ultimately 

known as the university of alexandria. under 

the auspices of philadelphu the professor of that institution 

render their hebrew sacred record into the greece 

language, which translate is known as the septuagint, or 

alexandrian version of the old testament. 

have acquire from the egypt astrologer the 

arts of healing, thaumaturgy and necromancy, and teaching 

them in their school, the professor of the jewish 

college of alexandria assume the title of essenes, or 

therapeutae, the egypt and greece words signify 

doctors, heal or wonder workers. possessed of the 

sad and gloomy characteristic of their race, they adopt 

the "contemplative life," or ascetic of the oriental 

gnosticism, from which they derive the name of ascetics. 

found a church for the propagation of their 

peculiar tenets, those who were set apart for the ministry 

assume the title of ecclesiastics. inculcate rigid temperance 

and self-denial among their people, they were 

known as enchratites, nazarite or abstainers; and the 

more devout among them retiring to monasteries, or to 

the solitude of cave and other secluded places, were also 

designate as monks, cenobites, friars, eremites, hermit 

or solitaries. 

the time have arrived, according to the cyclic 

teaching of astral worship, for the manifestation of the 

tenth and last incarnation of god sol, or, in other words, 

to, give a new name to the mythical genius of the sun, the 

professor of the jewish school of alexandria is resolve to 

inaugurate their own form of worship. while retain the 

same title under which they had paid homage to serapi 

and known as christians, essene or therapeutae, they 

substitute for their christ the name of the grecian bacchus, 

which, compose of the letters ΙΗΣ, signify yes, 

ie or jes. in compose their version of the gospel 

story, having, like their race, no inventive genius, they appropriate 

that of serapi as its basis and laid its scene in 

the land of their ancestry, but inconsistent retain the 

sign of the cross and the phraseology connected there 

with, which, have special reference to the nile river and 

its annual inundation, had no application whatever to the 

sterile land of judea. select what they conceive to 

be the best from other version of the gospel story, and assume 

the title of eclectics, they designate their system 

as the eclectic philosophy. in proof of the eclectic character 

of the gospel and epistle of ancient christianity, we 

refer to the ascetic inculcate therein, which, derive 

from the oriental gnosticism, we find perpetuate in the 

scripture of modern christianity; we also refer to the miracle 

of convert water into wine, taken from the gospel 

story of bacchus, and to the statement that the saviour 

was the son of a carpenter and was hung between two 

thieves, copy from the story of christna, the eighth, 

avatar of the east indian astrolatry. thus we see that, 

although the scene of the gospel story of ancient christianity 

was laid in the land of judea, its author have 

adopt a greece version of that story as its basis, given a 

greece title and name to their messiah, perpetuate a 

greece name for their sect and quote exclusively from the 

septuagint, or greece version of the old testament, the 

fact show conclusive that it was not jew of judea, but 

hellene jew of alexandria, who were the real author 

of the ancient christianity.
