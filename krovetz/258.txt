[sidenote: _creeping, writhing, insidious crawl and groping, the 
long arm reach out in its ghastly errand of death_] 

preface 
i had been out of germany for thirty-five years, drawn hither and 
thither by various glittering of will-of-the-wisps. when i return to 
my native country, i was as poor in pocket as when i left, and much 
poor in illusions. 

the berlin insurance company which i had represent with such mediocre 
success in switzerland, austria and belgium agree to let me sell for 
them at home, and by a curious coincidence there was an opening in the 
quaint old bavarian city in which i had been born and bred. 

i will pass over the strange mingle feelings with which i rode in a 
twentieth century railroad train past the thousand-year-old wall of one 
of the most curious ancient city in europe, a town moreover whose 
every winding narrow street and sharp-gabled building had been the 
companion of my infancy and childhood. no one seem to know me, and i 
recognize no one. for several days i made no attempt to sell life 
insurance, but wander in a dream, the bewilder ghost of my former 
self, about the spot which i had known in happy days. 

one dull rainy afternoon i took refuge from the weather in a dingy 
little coffee-house in which, at the age of fourteen or fifteen, i along 
with certain boon companions, had learned the gentle art of billiards. 
it seem as if every article of furniture was just as i had walk away 
from them, well toward half a century before. it was rain outside, 
and i sat alone in the gloomy, smoky old place, ponder the sweet and 
bitter mystery of life. 

while i sat thus, staring out with unseeing eyes at the rain which was 
by this time beating down smart on the pavement, i became conscious 
that someone in the room was staring at me. i had not notice that there 
was anyone else in the dark, low-ceilinged place except the obsequious 
proprietor who had serve me my cigar and coffee. now i realize that a 
man who sat in the corner diagonal across from me was study me 
curious from over his newspaper. his face was one that i had seen 
before. suddenly, across all the years, i remember him. and in that 
same moment he rose and came toward me with his hand held out. 

we had been in school together, in the gymnasium. he had been a strange 
fellow with few friends, but had enjoy the reputation of being the 
best student in his class. but in his last year in the gymnasium he had, 
for what reason i never knew, excited the animosity of a cantankerous 
old professor who had public declared that gustav was not the kind of 
boy who should have a gymnasium diploma and that he, the professor, was 
determined never to give him a passing grade. my father had admire the 
boy very much, and at one juncture when my mark look perilous low, 
he had employ gustav to tutor me. gustav had been so successful that 
father was delight and made him a present of a silver cigarette case 
with gustav's initial and mine engrave on it. i remember all this 
very distinct as we shook hands, but i was do fast thinking, 
because for the life of me i couldn't remember his strange last name. i 
had a feeling that it was a very foreign name, polish or croatia or 
something of the sort. as he mention this and that, i fear i answer 
him a little absently and incoherently. the name was almost there. the 
syllable flit tantalizing just out of my reach. but i was sure the 
name began with a b. wasn't it a bam- or a ban-something? ah! i had it. 
banaotovich! 

from that moment the conversation went more easily. i was surprize and 
pleased when banaotovich drew his silver cigarette-case out of his 
pocket to prove to me how highly he thought of my poor deceased father. 
we were soon launch on a cordial exchange of childhood memories. 
banaotovich seem a good-hearted fellow after all, and i wonder why 
in my childhood i had never been quite comfortable in his company. i 
remember that other boys of the group had admitted to me 
confidential that they were more than a little afraid of him. 

* * * * * 

the long we talk the more intimate, the more in the nature of a 
mutual confession, our conversation became. i admitted to banaotovich 
that the hifalutin fashion in which i had left the town to win fame and 
fortune years before, had been asinine in the extreme, and that it 
serve me just right to have to sneak back unknown and penniless. 
banaotovich rejoin that for all his pride in his school mark he had 
remain a person of no importance, and that the pot had not the 
slightest intention of making itself ridiculous by calling the kettle 
black. he seem almost painful inclined to run himself down. i could 
feel in his manner a sort of pathetic reach out for sympathy and 
consideration. and it began to seem as if he were about to tell me 
something or ask me for something. but whatever he had to tell seem 
hard to say, and it was slow in coming over his lips. 

banaotovich ordered two bottle of the heavy native wine. i drank 
sparing of it, because it go to my head. but banaotovich swallow 
two or three glassful in hasty succession, and his cheek grew flushed. 
there was a pause. sudden he lean across the table toward me and 
spoke in a hoarse, excited whisper. 

"modersohn," he said anxiously, "i want to make a confession to you--a 
terrible confession. it may turn you against me completely. maybe you 
don't want to hear it. if you don't, say so, and i'll go home. but it 
seem as if i've got to tell somebody about it. it seem as if i've got 
to find somebody who understand me and can excuse me, or it will kill 
me. shall i tell you? shall i?" 

i was startled. i was reasonably sure that banaotovich was no criminal, 
since he had live half a century in his native city, undisturbed and 
from all he had told me solvent and respected. i had always known that 
he was a queer fish, a brooding, solitary sort of person, and i settled 
myself to listen to some harmless bit of psychopathy which meant nothing 
except to the unfortunate subject. 

"my dear fellow," i said, no doubt a little patronizingly, "i am sure 
you haven't anything to confess that will make you out an outrageous 
rascal, but if it will do you any good to tell me your troubles, i am 
ready to listen to them." 

"thank you," said banaotovich in a tremble voice. "i've done nothing 
that they can put me behind the bar for. but i--i----" 

he stare at me sternly. 

"but i've done worse things," he said solemnly, "than some poor fellow 
that have been strung up by the neck and choke to death!" 

i laughed, a little nervously. "tell me your story, if you like," i 
said, "and let me decide just how black you are. but i haven't a great 
deal of apprehension. we're all of us poor miserable sinners, as far as 
that's concerned. i could tell you things about myself----" 

banaotovich was not listen to me at all. he had fallen sudden into 
a fit of black brooding. after a minute or two, he look up and ask 
sharply: 

"do you remember wolansky?" 

wolansky was the greece professor who had threaten to vote against 
banaotovich when he was finish his course at the gymnasium. 

"of course," said i. "and i remember well how he abuse you that last 
year. if there ever was a cantankerous old scoundrel, wolansky was just 
that identical individual!" 

"maybe," he said absently; then after another pause: 

"do you remember that wolansky die suddenly, just a little while before 
the end of the school year?" 

i nodded. "i imagine that was a great piece of good luck for you," i 
said. 

"yes," said banaotovich. "if he had lived, i should never have had my 
diploma. as it was, i finished with honors. if wolansky hadn't die when 
he did, i'd have been ruined. don't forget that--ruined!" 

i was puzzle at his insistence. "yes, you would have been seriously 
handicapped," i agreed. "ruined is the word, perhaps." 

banaotovich's face was purple with wine and some strange kind of 
suffering. "do you remember another thing?" he said thickly. "do you 
remember an old hindoo who had a dark little hole away back of the shop 
and the beer depot and the livery stable between the old market and the 
river?" 

"the old fellow that had love charm and told fortune and help people 
to health and wealth and happiness?" i said in a tone of slightly forced 
cheerfulness. it was hard to be cheerful with those somber eyes bore 
into you. "yes, i remember him, all right. i want to go and see him 
once, when i was about fifteen or sixteen, but father told me that 
meddle with the black art had sent more people to hell than it had 
helped. and father was so terribly earnest about it that he frightened 
me. i never went. as a matter of fact it was only a passing fancy, and i 
soon forgot all about him." 

"that hindoo," said my old school-fellow thoughtfully, "knew things 
about the secret forces in the universe that made him almost a god. and 
he taught me things that the wisest philosopher in the world doesn't 
suspect. still, your father may have been right. i think it very likely 
that what he taught me may send me to hell!" 

i shivered. i look up nervous to make sure that the way was clear to 
the door. i began to suspect that my friend banaotovich, though he was 
certainly not a criminal, might be a dangerous lunatic. 

my _vis-à-vis_ rub absently at a protuberance on his left side. i had 
notice it when he first came across the room to speak to me. a 
deformity--i was sure it had not been there when he was a boy--or 
perhaps a tumor or some such thing as that. 

"i kept very quiet about what the hindoo taught me, because i knew most 
people felt about such things much as you say your father did. and i 
want to get on in the world. but i had an idea the hindoo could help 
me get on. perhaps he _has_----" 

and he stare gloomy at space. 

"perhaps he has. and perhaps he hasn't." 

he brooded. then he took up the thread of his story. 

"wolansky nearly drove me to suicide. i read and studied and crammed, 
day and night. i try everything i could think of to overcome the man's 
antagonism. i crawl in the dust before him like a whip cur! nothing 
did any good. and when i saw he hate me and was determined to smash me, 
i began to hate _him_, too. i came to hate him worse than i hate the 
devil in hell. there was a time when i had to hold myself back with all 
my strength to keep from stick a knife into him or brain him with 
a chair. but the hindoo and i made some experiment with telepathy, and 
i discover that there are other ways of killing a man besides stabbing 
him or give him poison. 

"i learned how to make a man in front of me on the street turn around 
and look at me. i learned how to make _you_ dream about me and come and 
tell me the dream the next morning," (when he said that, i jumped, for i 
remember have done exactly that thing!). "i learned how to bring out 
a bruise on wolansky's face although he live on the other side of town; 
so that he went around ask people how he could have bump his 
forehead without knowing it. and at last i went to bed one night, set my 
mind on wolansky, and said over and over to myself a thousand times: 
die, you dog! you've _got_ to die! i _order_ you to die! 

"i said it over till i fell into a sort of trance. it wasn't sleep, i 
tell you. you can't sleep when you are in a state like that. and in my 
trance, i could feel another arm grow out of my side here and grow 
long and longer, and grow out through the window although the window 
was closed, and grow out across the street and down the street and right 
through the wall and across the river. 

"i had never known where wolansky lived. but that night i knew. i had 
never known the street or the house number. i had never been there in my 
life. but i can tell you just exactly how his bedroom looked. the 
wash-stand between the two windows, the work-table against the west 
wall, the wardrobe, the old divan against the north wall. in a corner 
the blue-gray tile stove with some of the tile chip off. and against 
the south wall--the bed he lay in. i can tell you the color of the 
blanket he pull up over his face. it was a dirty brownish red. 

"but my hand seem to go through the blanket and grip wolansky by the 
throat. first he sigh and turn his head to one side and try to 
wriggle free. then he raise his arms and try to get hold of something 
that wasn't there. his sigh turn into groans, and the groan change 
to a death rattle. he threw his arms and leg wildly around in the air, 
his body bent up like a bow. but my hand held his head down against the 
pillow. at last he quit struggle and drop down limp on the bed. 
then the arm came crawl back in to my body, and i came out of the 
trance--and went to sleep--or perhaps i fainted. 

"the next morning the director came into our classroom and told us 
wolansky had die in the night of some sort of attack. you remember 
that, i am sure----" 

when banaotovich began to tell me this story, he had look away from 
me, and his eyes never met mine during the telling. he had begun with a 
painful effort, but as he went on he grew more and more excited and more 
and more inflamed with hatred of the malicious old greece teacher, till 
it almost seem as if he had forgotten me and was living the astound 
experience through for himself alone. when he was through, his ecstasy 
of indignation left him and he sat dejected and apprehensive, study 
me pitiful out of the corner of his deep gray eyes. 

* * * * * 

when he stop speaking, there was a moment of silence. then i said 
something. i think what i said was, "very extraordinary!" 

he smiled, a strained, sarcastic smile. "extraordinary?" he repeated, 
with an interrogate point in his voice. 

"your nerves were strained to the breaking-point," i said. "your trouble 
with the old rascal had driven you half distracted. then there was all 
that occultistic hodgepodge with the old hindoo. and you were overwork 
and run down, anyway. no wonder you dream dream and saw visions. and 
it may have been that there was some telepathic contact between you and 
wolansky, and when he had his apoplectic attack----" 

the sarcastic smile deepen on banaotovich's face. "so you have it all 
explained, and i'm acquitted?" he inquired. 

"acquitted?" i cried. "you were never even accused. if the state were to 
bring action against every man who had a feeling that he would be 
happy if someone else were out of the way, the state would have a big 
job on its hands!" 

"very true," banaotovich assent icily. "i see i haven't got very far 
with you yet. you are force me to continue my not very edify 
autobiography.--did you know my father?" 

i remember his father, and i remember that he had not enjoy the 
best possible reputation. 

"i think i knew him," i said hesitantly. "he was a--a money-lender, 
wasn't he?" 

"don't spare my feelings," said banaotovich bitterly. "he was a usurer, 
and a cruel one. i had a feeling for years that his business was a 
disgrace to the family, and i made no bone about telling him so. there 
were ugly scenes. i thought several times of leave home. finally, 
father told me one day that since i didn't approve of the way he got his 
money, he was do me the favor of disinherit me. i told him that 
was all right with me, that i'd rather starve than live on money that 
was stain with the blood of poor debtors. 

"i thought at the time that i meant it. but about that time i had become 
interested in a young woman. i had never had much to do with the girls, 
and very few of them seem at all interested in me. but this one 
appear to like me, and when i made advances to her, she didn't repel 
me. i am no connoisseur of female beauty, but i think she was unusually 
attractive, and at that time i was half mad about her. still waters run 
deep, you know. 

"well, she had me under her spell so completely that i change my mind 
about father's money. i began to truckle to him, much as i had truckle 
to wolansky. i began to feel him out to find whether he had made a will. 
he was very cold and non-committal. finally i ask him outright if he 
would reconsider his decision to leave me penniless. he told me it was i 
that had made the decision, not he, and that he had no use for 
wishy-washy people that change their mind like weather-cocks. he was 
very sarcastic. i lost my temper and answer him back. we had a 
terrible quarrel, and finally he--he struck me. i was twenty years old 
and a big man than he. and i think no man ever had more stubborn 
pride, at bottom, than i have. 

"it was the wolansky thing all over again. the humiliation, the effort 
at ingratiation, the failure, the long, eating, gnawing, grow hatred. 
and it--it end the same way. the night of brood that harden into 
a devilish decision, the vision of the long arm, growing, stretching, 
crawling--but not so far this time, only through two wall and across 
our own house. you remember that father die of an apoplectic stroke, 
just as wolansky had done a year or two before." 

"yes, i think i remember," i said in considerable embarrassment. the 
thing _did_ begin to look uncanny. i was thorough sorry for the poor, 
cracked fellow, but i would just as soon not have been alone with him in 
that solitary drinking-place in the twilight. 

"well?" he said, almost sharply. 

"well, banaotovich," i answer with a show of confidence, "you have had 
a great deal of unhappiness, and you have my sympathy. this strange 
faculty you have of anticipate deaths, like the night-owls and the 
death-watch that tick in the walls, has made these bereavement an 
occasion of self-torment for you. i think you should see a 
psychiatrist." 

"anticipating--anticipating?" banaotovich had gone back and was 
repeating a word i had used, and as he repeated it he drum madly on 
the table with his fingers. "it's a curious coincidence that 
'anticipating' is just the word my wife use when i told her about it." 

"you--told--your wife--what you have just told me?" i stammered. "do you 
think that was wise?" 

"i couldn't help it," he said with a catch in his throat. "i thought i 
love her, and i had to talk to somebody. i was miserable, and i had a 
feeling that she might understand and be brought close to me by 
sympathy. now that i think of it, i can see that i was an egregious 
idiot, but i discover long ago that we aren't rational being after 
all. we are driven or drawn by mysterious forces, and we go to our 
destination because we can't help it. 

"my wife had always seem a little timid with me. i never seem to 
have the gift of attract people. and i don't know whether she would 
ever have been interested in me at all if i hadn't use a little--a 
little charm the hindoo taught me. perhaps that didn't have much to do 
with it--but i had never been happy with her. however that may be, one 
evening when she seem unusually approachable, i had just the same 
impulse that i had when i met you here tonight, and i told her about 
wolansky and father. she pooh-poohed it all just as you did. but she was 
afraid. i could see that. she was more and more afraid of me as the days 
went by. for a long time she try to be cordial and natural in my 
presence, but it was a sham and the poor thing couldn't keep it up. each 
of us knew as well what was in the mind of the other as if we had talk 
the situation over frankly for hours. we reach the point where we 
couldn't look each other in the face. no solitude could have been as 
ghastly as that solitude of two people who share a revolting secret. 
for i had convinced her that i was guilty. i had succeed in do what 
i had set out to do, and i had ruin two lives in do it. i have the 
faculty, it seems, of poison whatever i touch. only today, my wife 
said to me----" 

i start to my feet with a great rush of relief and thankfulness. "ah, 
your wife is alive, then?" i cried. 

"my wife is alive. that is--my _second_ wife is alive," he said, with a 
horrible forced smile. 

i sank back gasping. "what did you do with your first wife, you dirty 
hound?" i moan in helpless indignation. 

* * * * * 

he closed his eyes, and a wave of bitter triumph play about the 
muscle of his mouth. "have i convinced _you_ too, at last?" he said. 

then i realize that i had been an insult idiot. at worst, the man 
before me was a pathological case, and he certainly belong in an 
asylum rather than in a prison. 

"forgive me, banaotovich," i panted. "i don't know what made me----" 

he look at me sadly, almost compassionately. "there is nothing to 
forgive," he said, very quietly. "i am all you call me and a thousand 
times worse. now let me finish my story." 

"you don't need to," i said hastily. "i know all the rest of it." 

all interest, i am afraid nearly all sympathy, had gone out of me. what 
i want most of all was to get away from this melancholy citizen with 
power and madness in his gray eyes. 

"no, you don't know quite all of it yet," he insisted. "perhaps if i 
tell you the whole story, even if you can't excuse me--and i don't 
deserve your excusing, i don't _want_ your excusing--you can understand 
me a little better, and think of me a little more kindly. 

"there was another woman. i couldn't help it, any more than any of us 
can help anything. a fine, sympathetic young woman, who love me because 
she knew i was unhappy. i had been married to the other woman for four 
years. we were completely estranged. we could scarcely bear to speak to 
each other. i couldn't be easy one moment in the same house with her. i 
had a cot in my office out in town because i couldn't even sleep sound 
at home. it was hell. the terror in her eyes made me physically sick. my 
wife learned about the other woman. my wife was a devout catholic, and 
there was no possibility of a divorce. i could read in my wife's face 
just what went on in her mind. she knew the other woman had become my 
only reason for living. and one day i read in her eyes, along with the 
terror, a glint of desperate determination. she knew she was in danger, 
she knew i had a power that i could exercise when i chose in spite of 
all the court and police and jail in the country. she knew her life 
was in danger, and her eyes told me that mine was in danger for that 
very reason. i didn't blame her. half my grief through all the years had 
been grief for _her_. but the instinct of self-defense in me was 
strong--and--she went--too--like----" 

[illustration: "and she went, too, like the other."] 

he never finished his sentence. he drop his head on the table and 
began to sob hysterically. i laid a gingerly hand on his shoulder. 

"banaotovich," i said unsteadily, "i'm sorry for you----" 

he sat up and support his chin in both hands. "i haven't been as--as 
bad as all this sound like," he said after a while. "before i was 
married a second time, i went to the chief of police and gave myself up. 
the chief listen to my story--i didn't try to explain it all, as i've 
done with you, but just blurt out the main facts; but the long he 
listen the uneasy he became, and when i got through he ask me 
nervous if i didn't think i ought to go into a sanitarium for a while. 
then he bowed me out in a big hurry. perhaps if i had told him all the 
ins and out of it, it might have been different----" 

"but don't you think he's right about the sanitarium?" 

"right? i'm as sane as you are. i've kill three people, a crazy 
scoundrel, a hard man, and a pure, innocent woman. but i did it all 
because i had to. a sanitarium wouldn't do me or anyone else any good, 
and it would be a heavy expense. i have taken the responsibility for 
another pure, innocent woman, and i must support her. the war and the 
depression swept away my father's fortune, and my present business has 
dwindle away till i am making only the barest living. i have applied 
for the agency for a big berlin insurance company, and if i can get it, 
along with my other business, i shall be fairly comfortable. but i 
understand there is some talk of their send in a representative from 
outside. if they do that, if they take the bread out of my mouth like 
that, it won't be good for the outsider!" 

he was drunk, and his drunken was working him into an ugly mood. he 
was dangerous, and physical courage was never my strong point. 

"what is the name of the berlin company?" i ask timidly. 

he name the firm i myself work for. then he fumble for his bottle, 
and with stern and painful attention set about the difficult and 
delicate task of filling his glass again. i mutter something about 
being back in a moment, and made for the door. he was too busy to pay 
any attention to me. 

when i had the door safe shut behind me, i sprint through the rain 
to my hotel as if the devil himself were after me.... 

* * * * * 

it was a long time before i got over waking up in the middle of the 
night with the feeling that an icy, iron-muscled hand was clutch at 
my throat. i don't have the experience often any more, but i have never 
seen the city of my birth since that awful night. i got out on the 
midnight train, and my company obliging gave me territory on the other 
side of germany. 

some time ago i happen to see a notice in the paper to the effect that 
a certain patient name g. banaotovich had die sudden in the 
staatliche nervenheilanstalt in nuremberg. but i have met the name 
rather frequent of late, and i think it is a fairly common one. i 
didn't investigate.
