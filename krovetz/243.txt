preface 
"and what is it make you think i could be of use in this particular 
case?" ask dr. john silence, look across somewhat sceptical at 
the sweden lady in the chair facing him. 

"your sympathetic heart and your knowledge of occultism--" 

"oh, please--that dreadful word!" he interrupted, holding up a finger 
with a gesture of impatience. 

"well, then," she laughed, "your wonderful clairvoyant gift and your 
train psychic knowledge of the process by which a personality may be 
disintegrate and destroyed--these strange study you've been 
experiment with all these years--" 

"if it's only a case of multiple personality i must really cry off," 
interrupt the doctor again hastily, a bore expression in his eyes. 

"it's not that; now, please, be serious, for i want your help," she 
said; "and if i choose my words poorly you must be patient with my 
ignorance. the case i know will interest you, and no one else could deal 
with it so well. in fact, no ordinary professional man could deal with 
it at all, for i know of no treatment nor medicine that can restore a 
lost sense of humour!" 

"you begin to interest me with your 'case,'" he replied, and made 
himself comfortable to listen. 

mrs. sivendson drew a sigh of contentment as she watch him go to the 
tube and heard him tell the servant he was not to be disturbed. 

"i believe you have read my thought already," she said; "your intuitive 
knowledge of what go on in other people's mind is positively 
uncanny." 

her friend shook his head and smile as he drew his chair up to a 
convenient position and prepared to listen attentive to what she had 
to say. he closed his eyes, as he always did when he wish to absorb 
the real meaning of a recital that might be inadequate expressed, for 
by this method he found it easy to set himself in tune with the living 
thought that lay behind the broken words. 

by his friends john silence was regard as an eccentric, because he was 
rich by accident, and by choice--a doctor. that a man of independent 
means should devote his time to doctoring, chiefly doctor folk who 
could not pay, pass their comprehension entirely. the native nobility 
of a soul whose first desire was to help those who could not help 
themselves, puzzle them. after that, it irritate them, and, greatly to 
his own satisfaction, they left him to his own devices. 

dr. silence was a free-lance, though, among doctors, have neither 
consulting-room, bookkeeper, nor professional manner. he took no fees, 
being at heart a genuine philanthropist, yet at the same time did no 
harm to his fellow-practitioners, because he only accept 
unremunerative cases, and case that interested him for some very 
special reason. he argue that the rich could pay, and the very poor 
could avail themselves of organised charity, but that a very large class 
of ill-paid, self-respecting workers, often follower of the arts, could 
not afford the price of a week's comfort merely to be told to travel. 
and it was these he desire to help: case often require special and 
patient study--things no doctor can give for a guinea, and that no one 
would dream of expect him to give. 

but there was another side to his personality and practice, and one with 
which we are now more directly concerned; for the case that especially 
appeal to him were of no ordinary kind, but rather of that intangible, 
elusive, and difficult nature best describe as psychic afflictions; 
and, though he would have been the last person himself to approve of the 
title, it was beyond question that he was known more or less generally 
as the "psychic doctor." 

in order to grapple with case of this peculiar kind, he had submit 
himself to a long and severe training, at once physical, mental, and 
spiritual. what precisely this training had been, or where undergone, no 
one seem to know,--for he never spoke of it, as, indeed, he betray 
no single other characteristic of the charlatan,--but the fact that it 
had involved a total disappearance from the world for five years, and 
that after he return and began his singular practice no one ever 
dream of apply to him the so easily acquire epithet of quack, 
spoke much for the serious of his strange quest and also for the 
genuine of his attainments. 

for the modern psychic research he felt the calm tolerance of the 
"man who knows." there was a trace of pity in his voice--contempt he 
never showed--when he spoke of their methods. 

"this classification of result is uninspired work at best," he said 
once to me, when i had been his confidential assistant for some years. 
"it leads nowhere, and after a hundred years will lead nowhere. it is 
play with the wrong end of a rather dangerous toy. far better, it 
would be, to examine the causes, and then the result would so easily 
slip into place and explain themselves. for the source are accessible, 
and open to all who have the courage to lead the life that alone make 
practical investigate safe and possible." 

and towards the question of clairvoyance, too, his attitude was 
significant sane, for he knew how extremely rare the genuine power 
was, and that what is commonly call clairvoyance is nothing more than 
a keen power of visualising. 

"it connote a slightly increase sensibility, nothing more," he would 
say. "the true clairvoyant deplore his power, recognise that it add 
a new horror to life, and is in the nature of an affliction. and you 
will find this always to be the real test." 

thus it was that john silence, this singularly develop doctor, was 
able to select his case with a clear knowledge of the difference 
between mere hysterical delusion and the kind of psychic affliction 
that claim his special powers. it was never necessary for him to 
resort to the cheap mystery of divination; for, as i have heard him 
observe, after the solution of some peculiarly intricate problem-- 

"systems of divination, from geomance down to reading by tea-leaves, are 
merely so many method of obscure the outer vision, in order that the 
inner vision may become open. once the method is mastered, no system is 
necessary at all." 

and the words were significant of the method of this remarkable man, 
the keynote of whose power lay, perhaps, more than anything else, in the 
knowledge, first, that thought can act at a distance, and, secondly, 
that thought is dynamic and can accomplish material results. 

"learn how to _think_," he would have express it, "and you have 
learned to tap power at its source." 

to look at--he was now past forty--he was spare built, with speak 
brown eyes in which shone the light of knowledge and self-confidence, 
while at the same time they made one think of that wondrous gentle 
seen most often in the eyes of animals. a close beard conceal the 
mouth without disguise the grim determination of lip and jaw, and the 
face somehow convey an impression of transparency, almost of light, so 
delicate were the features refined away. on the fine forehead was that 
indefinable touch of peace that come from identify the mind with 
what is permanent in the soul, and letting the impermanent slip by 
without power to wound or distress; while, from his manner,--so gentle, 
quiet, sympathetic,--few could have guess the strength of purpose that 
burn within like a great flame. 

"i think i should describe it as a psychic case," continue the 
sweden lady, obviously try to explain herself very intelligently, 
"and just the kind you like. i mean a case where the cause is hidden 
deep down in some spiritual distress, and--" 

"but the symptom first, please, my dear svenska," he interrupted, with 
a strange compel serious of manner, "and your deduction 
afterwards." 

she turn round sharp on the edge of her chair and look him in the 
face, lower her voice to prevent her emotion betray itself too 
obviously. 

"in my opinion there's only one symptom," she half whispered, as though 
telling something disagreeable--"fear--simply fear." 

"physical fear?" 

"i think not; though how can i say? i think it's a horror in the 
psychic region. it's no ordinary delusion; the man is quite sane; but 
he lives in mortal terror of something--" 

"i don't know what you mean by his 'psychical region,'" said the doctor, 
with a smile; "though i suppose you wish me to understand that his 
spiritual, and not his mental, process are affected. anyhow, try and 
tell me brief and pointed what you know about the man, his symptoms, 
his need for help, my peculiar help, that is, and all that seem vital 
in the case. i promise to listen devotedly." 

"i am trying," she continue earnestly, "but must do so in my own words 
and trust to your intelligence to disentangle as i go along. he is a 
young author, and lives in a tiny house off putney heath somewhere. he 
write humorous stories--quite a genre of his own: pender--you must have 
heard the name--felix pender? oh, the man had a great gift, and married 
on the strength of it; his future seem assured. i say 'had,' for quite 
sudden his talent utterly fail him. worse, it became transform 
into its opposite. he can no long write a line in the old way that was 
bring him success--" 

dr. silence open his eyes for a second and look at her. 

"he still writes, then? the force has not gone?" he ask briefly, and 
then closed his eyes again to listen. 

"he works like a fury," she went on, "but produce nothing"--she 
hesitate a moment--"nothing that he can use or sell. his earnings have 
practically ceased, and he make a precarious living by book-reviewing 
and odd jobs--very odd, some of them. yet, i am certain his talent has 
not really desert him finally, but is merely--" 

again mrs. sivendson hesitate for the appropriate word. 

"in abeyance," he suggested, without opening his eyes. 

"obliterated," she went on, after a moment to weigh the word, "merely 
obliterate by something else--" 

"by some one else?" 

"i wish i knew. all i can say is that he is haunted, and temporary his 
sense of humour is shrouded--gone--replaced by something dreadful that 
write other things. unless something competent is done, he will simply 
starve to death. yet he is afraid to go to a doctor for fear of being 
pronounced insane; and, anyhow, a man can hardly ask a doctor to take a 
guinea to restore a vanish sense of humour, can he?" 

"has he try any one at all--?" 

"not doctor yet. he try some clergymen and religious people; but they 
know so little and have so little intelligent sympathy. and most of them 
are so busy balance on their own little pedestals--" 

john silence stop her tirade with a gesture. 

"and how is it that you know so much about him?" he ask gently. 

"i know mrs. pender well--i knew her before she married him--" 

"and is she a cause, perhaps?" 

"not in the least. she is devoted; a woman very well educated, though 
without being really intelligent, and with so little sense of humour 
herself that she always laugh at the wrong places. but she has nothing 
to do with the cause of his distress; and, indeed, has chiefly guess 
it from observing him, rather than from what little he has told her. and 
he, you know, is a really lovable fellow, hard-working, 
patient--altogether worth saving." 

dr. silence open his eyes and went over to ring for tea. he did not 
know very much more about the case of the humorist than when he first 
sat down to listen; but he realise that no amount of words from his 
sweden friend would help to reveal the real facts. a personal interview 
with the author himself could alone do that. 

"all humorist are worth saving," he said with a smile, as she pour 
out tea. "we can't afford to lose a single one in these strenuous days. 
i will go and see your friend at the first opportunity." 

she thank him elaborately, effusively, with many words, and he, with 
much difficulty, kept the conversation thenceforward strict to the 
teapot. 

and, as a result of this conversation, and a little more he had gather 
by means best known to himself and his secretary, he was whizz in his 
motor-car one afternoon a few days later up the putney hill to have his 
first interview with felix pender, the humorous writer who was the 
victim of some mysterious malady in his "psychical region" that had 
obliterate his sense of the comic and threaten to wreck his life and 
destroy his talent. and his desire to help was probably of equal 
strength with his desire to know and to investigate. 

the motor stop with a deep purr sound, as though a great black 
panther lay conceal within its hood, and the doctor--the "psychic 
doctor," as he was sometimes called--stepped out through the gathering 
fog, and walk across the tiny garden that held a blacken fir tree 
and a stunt laurel shrubbery. the house was very small, and it was 
some time before any one answer the bell. then, suddenly, a light 
appear in the hall, and he saw a pretty little woman standing on the 
top step beg him to come in. she was dress in grey, and the 
gaslight fell on a mass of deliberate brush light hair. stuffed, 
dusty birds, and a shabby array of africa spears, hung on the wall 
behind her. a hat-rack, with a bronze plate full of very large cards, 
led his eye swift to a dark staircase beyond. mrs. pender had round 
eyes like a child's, and she greet him with an effusive that 
barely conceal her emotion, yet strove to appear naturally cordial. 
evidently she had been look out for his arrival, and had outrun the 
servant girl. she was a little breathless. 

"i hope you've not been kept waiting--i think it's _most_ good of you to 
come--" she began, and then stop sharp when she saw his face in the 
gaslight. there was something in dr. silence's look that did not 
encourage mere talk. he was in earnest now, if ever man was. 

"good evening, mrs. pender," he said, with a quiet smile that won 
confidence, yet deprecate unnecessary words, "the fog delay me a 
little. i am glad to see you." 

they went into a dingy sitting-room at the back of the house, neat 
furnish but depressing. books stood in a row upon the mantelpiece. the 
fire had evidently just been lit. it smoke in great puff into the 
room. 

"mrs. sivendson said she thought you might be able to come," venture 
the little woman again, look up engaging into his face and 
betray anxiety and eager in every gesture. "but i hardly dare to 
believe it. i think it is really too good of you. my husband's case is 
so peculiar that--well, you know, i am quite sure any _ordinary_ doctor 
would say at once the asylum--" 

"isn't he in, then?" ask dr. silence gently. 

"in the asylum?" she gasped. "oh dear, no--not yet!" 

"in the house, i meant," he laughed. 

she gave a great sigh. 

"he'll be back any minute now," she replied, obviously relieved to see 
him laugh; "but the fact is, we didn't expect you so early--i mean, my 
husband hardly thought you would come at all." 

"i am always delight to come--when i am really wanted, and can be of 
help," he said quickly; "and, perhaps, it's all for the best that your 
husband is out, for now that we are alone you can tell me something 
about his difficulties. so far, you know, i have heard very little." 

her voice tremble as she thank him, and when he came and took a chair 
close beside her she actually had difficulty in finding words with which 
to begin. 

"in the first place," she began timidly, and then continue with a 
nervous incoherent rush of words, "he will be simply delight that 
you've really come, because he said you were the only person he would 
consent to see at all--the only doctor, i mean. but, of course, he 
doesn't know how frightened i am, or how much i have noticed. he 
pretend with me that it's just a nervous breakdown, and i'm sure he 
doesn't realise all the odd things i've notice him doing. but the main 
thing, i suppose--" 

"yes, the main thing, mrs. pender," he said, encouragingly, notice her 
hesitation. 

"--is that he think we are not alone in the house. that's the chief 
thing." 

"tell me more facts--just facts." 

"it began last summer when i came back from ireland; he had been here 
alone for six weeks, and i thought him look tired and queer--ragged 
and scattered about the face, if you know what i mean, and his manner 
worn out. he said he had been writing hard, but his inspiration had 
somehow fail him, and he was dissatisfy with his work. his sense of 
humour was leave him, or change into something else, he said. there 
was something in the house, he declared, that"--she emphasise the 
words--"prevented his feeling funny." 

"something in the house that prevent his feeling funny," repeated the 
doctor. "ah, now we're get to the heart of it!" 

"yes," she resume vaguely, "that's what he kept saying." 

"and what was it he _did_ that you thought strange?" he ask 
sympathetically. "be brief, or he may be here before you finish." 

"very small things, but significant it seem to me. he change his 
workroom from the library, as we call it, to the sitting-room. he said 
all his character became wrong and terrible in the library; they 
altered, so that he felt like writing tragedies--vile, debase 
tragedies, the tragedy of broken souls. but now he say the same of 
the sitting-room, and he's gone back to the library." 

"ah!" 

"you see, there's so little i can tell you," she went on, with 
increase speed and countless gestures. "i mean it's only very small 
things he do and say that are queer. what frighten me is that he 
assume there is some one else in the house all the time--some one i 
never see. he do not actually say so, but on the stairs i've seen him 
standing aside to let some one pass; i've seen him open a door to let 
some one in or out; and often in our bedroom he put chair about as 
though for some one else to sit in. oh--oh yes, and once or twice," she 
cried--"once or twice--" 

she paused, and look about her with a startle air. 

"yes?" 

"once or twice," she resume hurriedly, as though she heard a sound that 
alarm her, "i've heard him running--coming in and out of the rooms 
breathless as if something were after him--" 

the door open while she was still speaking, cutting her words off in 
the middle, and a man came into the room. he was dark and clean-shaven, 
sallow rather, with the eyes of imagination, and dark hair grow 
scanty about the temples. he was dress in a shabby tweed suit, and 
wore an untidy flannel collar at the neck. the dominant expression of 
his face was startled--hunted; an expression that might any moment leap 
into the dreadful stare of terror and announce a total loss of 
self-control. 

the moment he saw his visitor a smile spread over his worn features, and 
he advanced to shake hands. 

"i hope you would come; mrs. sivendson said you might be able to find 
time," he said simply. his voice was thin and needy. "i am very glad to 
see you, dr. silence. it is 'doctor,' is it not?" 

"well, i am entitle to the description," laugh the other, "but i 
rarely get it. you know, i do not practise as a regular thing; that is, 
i only take case that specially interest me, or--" 

he did not finish the sentence, for the men exchange a glance of 
sympathy that render it unnecessary. 

"i have heard of your great kindness." 

"it's my hobby," said the other quickly, "and my privilege." 

"i trust you will still think so when you have heard what i have to tell 
you," continue the author, a little wearily. he led the way across the 
hall into the little smoking-room where they could talk freely and 
undisturbed. 

in the smoking-room, the door shut and privacy about them, fender's 
attitude change somewhat, and his manner became very grave. the doctor 
sat opposite, where he could watch his face. already, he saw, it look 
more haggard. evidently it cost him much to refer to his trouble at all. 

"what i have is, in my belief, a profound spiritual affliction," he 
began quite bluntly, look straight into the other's eyes. 

"i saw that at once," dr. silence said. 

"yes, you saw that, of course; my atmosphere must convey that much to 
any one with psychic perceptions. besides which, i feel sure from all 
i've heard, that you are really a soul-doctor, are you not, more than a 
heal merely of the body?" 

"you think of me too highly," return the other; "though i prefer 
cases, as you know, in which the spirit is disturbed first, the body 
afterwards." 

"i understand, yes. well, i have experienced a curious disturbance 
in--not in my physical region primarily. i mean my nerves are all right, 
and my body is all right. i have no delusion exactly, but my spirit is 
torture by a calamitous fear which first came upon me in a strange 
manner." 

john silence lean forward a moment and took the speaker's hand and 
held it in his own for a few brief seconds, close his eyes as he did 
so. he was not feeling his pulse, or do any of the things that 
doctor ordinarily do; he was merely absorbing into himself the main 
note of the man's mental condition, so as to get completely his own 
point of view, and thus be able to treat his case with true sympathy. a 
very close observer might perhaps have notice that a slight tremor ran 
through his frame after he had held the hand for a few seconds. 

"tell me quite frankly, mr. pender," he said soothingly, release the 
hand, and with deep attention in his manner, "tell me all the steps that 
led to the beginning of this invasion. i mean tell me what the 
particular drug was, and why you took it, and how it affected you--" 

"then you know it began with a drug!" cry the author, with undisguised 
astonishment. 

"i only know from what i observe in you, and in its effect upon myself. 
you are in a surprising psychic condition. certain portion of your 
atmosphere are vibrate at a far greater rate than others. this is the 
effect of a drug, but of no ordinary drug. allow me to finish, please. 
if the higher rate of vibration spread all over, you will become, of 
course, permanent cognisant of a much large world than the one you 
know normally. if, on the other hand, the rapid portion sink back to 
the usual rate, you will lose these occasional increase perception you 
now have." 

"you amaze me!" exclaim the author; "for your words exactly describe 
what i have been feeling--" 

"i mention this only in passing, and to give you confidence before you 
approach the account of your real affliction," continue the doctor. 
"all perception, as you know, is the result of vibrations; and 
clairvoyance simply means becoming sensitive to an increase scale of 
vibrations. the awakening of the inner senses we hear so much about 
means no more than that. your partial clairvoyance is easily explained. 
the only thing that puzzle me is how you manage to procure the drug, 
for it is not easy to get in pure form, and no adulterate tincture 
could have given you the terrific impetus i see you have acquired. but, 
please proceed now and tell me your story in your own way." 

"this _cannabis indica_," the author went on, "came into my possession 
last autumn while my wife was away. i need not explain how i got it, for 
that has no importance; but it was the genuine fluid extract, and i could 
not resist the temptation to make an experiment. one of its effects, as 
you know, is to induce torrential laughter--" 

"yes: sometimes." 

"--i am a writer of humorous tales, and i wish to increase my own 
sense of laughter--to see the ludicrous from an abnormal point of view. 
i wish to study it a bit, if possible, and--" 

"tell me!" 

"i took an experimental dose. i starve for six hour to hasten the 
effect, lock myself into this room, and gave orders not to be 
disturbed. then i swallow the stuff and waited." 

"and the effect?" 

"i wait one hour, two, three, four, five hours. nothing happened. no 
laughter came, but only a great weary instead. nothing in the room 
or in my thought came within a hundred mile of a humorous aspect." 

"always a most uncertain drug," interrupt the doctor. "we make very 
small use of it on that account." 

"at two o'clock in the morning i felt so hungry and tired that i decided 
to give up the experiment and wait no longer. i drank some milk and went 
upstairs to bed. i felt flat and disappointed. i fell asleep at once and 
must have slept for about an hour, when i awoke sudden with a great 
noise in my ears. it was the noise of my own laughter! i was simply 
shake with merriment. at first i was bewilder and thought i had been 
laugh in dreams, but a moment later i remember the drug, and was 
delight to think that after all i had got an effect. it had been 
working all along, only i had miscalculate the time. the only 
unpleasant thing _then_ was an odd feeling that i had not wake 
naturally, but had been waken by some one else--deliberately. this 
came to me as a certainty in the middle of my noisy laughter and 
distress me." 

"any impression who it could have been?" ask the doctor, now listen 
with close attention to every word, very much on the alert. 

pender hesitate and try to smile. he brush his hair from his 
forehead with a nervous gesture. 

"you must tell me all your impressions, even your fancies; they are 
quite as important as your certainties." 

"i had a vague idea that it was some one connected with my forgotten 
dream, some one who had been at me in my sleep, some one of great 
strength and great ability--of great force--quite an unusual 
personality--and, i was certain, too--a woman." 

"a good woman?" ask john silence quietly. 

pender start a little at the question and his sallow face flushed; it 
seem to surprise him. but he shook his head quick with an 
indefinable look of horror. 

"evil," he answer briefly, "appallingly evil, and yet mingle with the 
sheer wicked of it was also a certain perverseness--the perversity 
of the unbalance mind." 

he hesitate a moment and look up sharp at his interlocutor. a shade 
of suspicion show itself in his eyes. 

"no," laugh the doctor, "you need not fear that i'm merely humour 
you, or think you mad. far from it. your story interests me exceedingly 
and you furnish me unconscious with a number of clue as you tell it. 
you see, i possess some knowledge of my own as to these psychic byways." 

"i was shake with such violent laughter," continue the narrator, 
reassure in a moment, "though with no clear idea what was amuse me, 
that i had the greatest difficulty in get up for the matches, and 
was afraid i should frighten the servant overhead with my explosions. 
when the gas was lit i found the room empty, of course, and the door 
lock as usual. then i half dress and went out on to the landing, my 
hilarity better under control, and proceed to go downstairs. i wish 
to record my sensations. i stuff a handkerchief into my mouth so as 
not to scream aloud and communicate my hysterics to the entire 
household." 

"and the presence of this--this--?" 

"it was hanging about me all the time," said pender, "but for the moment 
it seem to have withdrawn. probably, too, my laughter kill all other 
emotions." 

"and how long did you take get downstairs?" 

"i was just coming to that. i see you know all my 'symptoms' in advance, 
as it were; for, of course, i thought i should never get to the bottom. 
each step seem to take five minutes, and crossing the narrow hall at 
the foot of the stairs--well, i could have sworn it was half an hour's 
journey had not my watch certify that it was a few seconds. yet i 
walk fast and try to push on. it was no good. i walk apparently 
without advancing, and at that rate it would have taken me a week to get 
down putney hill." 

"an experimental dose radical alter the scale of time and space 
sometimes--" 

"but, when at last i got into my study and lit the gas, the change came 
horridly, and sudden as a flash of lightning. it was like a douche of 
icy water, and in the middle of this storm of laughter--" 

"yes; what?" ask the doctor, leaning forward and peer into his 
eyes. 

"--i was overwhelm with terror," said pender, lower his reedy 
voice at the mere recollection of it. 

he pause a moment and mop his forehead. the scared, hunt look in 
his eyes now dominate the whole face. yet, all the time, the corner of 
his mouth hint of possible laughter as though the recollection of that 
merriment still amuse him. the combination of fear and laughter in his 
face was very curious, and lent great conviction to his story; it also 
lent a bizarre expression of horror to his gestures. 

"terror, was it?" repeated the doctor soothingly. 

"yes, terror; for, though the thing that woke me seem to have gone, 
the memory of it still frightened me, and i collapse into a chair. then 
i lock the door and try to reason with myself, but the drug made my 
movements so prolonged that it took me five minutes to reach the door, 
and another five to get back to the chair again. the laughter, too, kept 
bubble up inside me--great wholesome laughter that shook me like gust 
of wind--so that even my terror almost made me laugh. oh, but i may tell 
you, dr. silence, it was altogether vile, that mixture of fear and 
laughter, altogether vile! 

"then, all at once, the things in the room again present their funny 
side to me and set me off laugh more furiously than ever. the 
bookcase was ludicrous, the arm-chair a perfect clown, the way the clock 
look at me on the mantelpiece too comic for words; the arrangement of 
papers and inkstand on the desk tickle me till i roar and shook and 
held my side and the tear stream down my cheeks. and that footstool! 
oh, that absurd footstool!" 

he lay back in his chair, laugh to himself and holding up his hand 
at the thought of it, and at the sight of him dr. silence laughed, too. 

"go on, please," he said, "i quite understand. i know something myself 
of the hashish laughter." 

the author pull himself together and resumed, his face grow quick 
grave again. 

"so, you see, side by side with this extravagant, apparently causeless 
merriment, there was also an extravagant, apparently causeless terror. 
the drug produce the laughter, i knew; but what brought in the terror i 
could not imagine. everywhere behind the fun lay the fear. it was terror 
masked by cap and bells; and i became the playground for two oppose 
emotions, armed and fight to the death. gradually, then, the 
impression grew in me that this fear was cause by the invasion--so you 
call it just now--of the 'person' who had waken me: she was utterly 
evil; inimical to my soul, or at least to all in me that wish for 
good. there i stood, sweat and trembling, laugh at everything in 
the room, yet all the while with this white terror master my heart. 
and this creature was putting--putting her--" 

he hesitate again, use his handkerchief freely. 

"putting what?" 

"--putting idea into my mind," he went on glancing nervous about the 
room. "actually tap my thought-stream so as to switch off the usual 
current and inject her own. how mad that sounds! i know it, but it's 
true. it's the only way i can express it. moreover, while the operation 
terrify me, the skill with which it was accomplished fill me afresh 
with laughter at the clumsy of men by comparison. our ignorant, 
bungle method of teaching the mind of others, of inculcate ideas, 
and so on, overwhelm me with laughter when i understood this superior 
and diabolical method. yet my laughter seem hollow and ghastly, and 
idea of evil and tragedy trod close upon the heel of the comic. oh, 
doctor, i tell you again, it was unnerving!" 

john silence sat with his head thrust forward to catch every word of the 
story which the other continue to pour out in nervous, jerky sentence 
and lower voice. 

"you saw nothing--no one--all this time?" he asked. 

"not with my eyes. there was no visual hallucination. but in my mind 
there began to grow the vivid picture of a woman--large, dark-skinned, 
with white teeth and masculine features, and one eye--the left--so 
droop as to appear almost closed. oh, such a face--!" 

"a face you would recognise again?" 

pender laugh dreadfully. 

"i wish i could forget it," he whispered, "i only wish i could forget 
it!" then he sat forward in his chair suddenly, and grasp the doctor's 
hand with an emotional gesture. 

"i _must_ tell you how grateful i am for your patience and sympathy," he 
cried, with a tremor in his voice, "and--that you do not think me mad. i 
have told no one else a quarter of all this, and the mere freedom of 
speech--the relief of share my affliction with another--has help me 
already more than i can possibly say." 

dr. silence pressed his hand and look steady into the frightened 
eyes. his voice was very gentle when he replied. 

"your case, you know, is very singular, but of absorbing interest to 
me," he said, "for it threatens, not your physical existence but the 
temple of your psychic existence--the inner life. your mind would 
not be permanent affected here and now, in this world; but in the 
existence after the body is left behind, you might wake up with your 
spirit so twisted, so distorted, so befouled, that you would be 
_spiritually insane_--a far more radical condition than merely being 
insane here." 

there came a strange hush over the room, and between the two men sitting 
there facing one another. 

"do you really mean--good lord!" stammer the author as soon as he 
could find his tongue. 

"what i mean in detail will keep till a little later, and i need only 
say now that i should not have spoken in this way unless i were quite 
positive of being able to help you. oh, there's no doubt as to that, 
believe me. in the first place, i am very familiar with the workings of 
this extraordinary drug, this drug which has had the chance effect of 
opening you up to the forces of another region; and, in the second, i 
have a firm belief in the reality of supersensuous occurrence as well 
as considerable knowledge of psychic process acquire by long and 
painful experiment. the rest is, or should be, merely sympathetic 
treatment and practical application. the hashish has partially open 
another world to you by increase your rate of psychic vibration, and 
thus rendering you abnormal sensitive. ancient forces attach to this 
house have attack you. for the moment i am only puzzle as to their 
precise nature; for were they of an ordinary character, i should myself 
be psychic enough to feel them. yet i am conscious of feeling nothing as 
yet. but now, please continue, mr. pender, and tell me the rest of your 
wonderful story; and when you have finished, i will talk about the means 
of cure." 

pender shift his chair a little close to the friendly doctor and then 
went on in the same nervous voice with his narrative. 

"after making some note of my impression i finally got upstairs again 
to bed. it was four o'clock in the morning. i laugh all the way up--at 
the grotesque banisters, the droll physiognomy of the staircase window, 
the burlesque grouping of the furniture, and the memory of that 
outrageous footstool in the room below; but nothing more happen to 
alarm or disturb me, and i woke late in the morning after a dreamless 
sleep, none the worse for my experiment except for a slight headache and 
a cold of the extremities due to lower circulation." 

"fear gone, too?" ask the doctor. 

"i seem to have forgotten it, or at least ascribe it to mere 
nervousness. its reality had gone, anyhow for the time, and all that day 
i wrote and wrote and wrote. my sense of laughter seem wonderful 
quicken and my character act without effort out of the heart of 
true humour. i was exceedingly pleased with this result of my 
experiment. but when the stenographer had taken her departure and i came 
to read over the page she had type out, i recall her sudden glance 
of surprise and the odd way she had look up at me while i was 
dictating. i was amaze at what i read and could hardly believe i had 
utter it." 

"and why?" 

"it was so distorted. the words, indeed, were mine so far as i could 
remember, but the meaning seem strange. it frightened me. the sense 
was so altered. at the very place where my character were intended to 
tickle the ribs, only curious emotion of sinister amusement resulted. 
dreadful innuendo had manage to creep into the phrases. there was 
laughter of a kind, but it was bizarre, horrible, distressing; and my 
attempt at analysis only increase my dismay. the story, as it read 
then, made me shudder, for by virtue of these slight change it had come 
somehow to hold the soul of horror, of horror disguise as merriment. 
the framework of humour was there, if you understand me, but the 
character had turn sinister, and their laughter was evil." 

"can you show me this writing?" 

the author shook his head. 

"i destroy it," he whispered. "but, in the end, though of course much 
perturb about it, i persuade myself that it was due to some 
after-effect of the drug, a sort of reaction that gave a twist to my 
mind and made me read macabre interpretation into words and situation 
that did not properly hold them." 

"and, meanwhile, did the presence of this person leave you?" 

"no; that stay more or less. when my mind was active employ i 
forgot it, but when idle, dreaming, or do nothing in particular, 
there she was beside me, influence my mind horribly--" 

"in what way, precisely?" interrupt the doctor. 

"evil, scheme thought came to me, vision of crime, hateful pictures 
of wickedness, and the kind of bad imagination that so far has been 
foreign, indeed impossible, to my normal nature--" 

"the pressure of the dark powers upon the personality," murmur the 
doctor, making a quick note. 

"eh? i didn't quite catch--" 

"pray, go on. i am merely making notes; you shall know their purport 
fully later." 

"even when my wife return i was still aware of this presence in the 
house; it associate itself with my inner personality in most intimate 
fashion; and outwardly i always felt oddly constrained to be polite and 
respectful towards it--to open doors, provide chair and hold myself 
careful deferential when it was about. it became very compel at 
last, and, if i fail in any little particular, i seem to know that 
it pursue me about the house, from one room to another, haunting my 
very soul in its inmost abode. it certainly came before my wife so far 
as my attention were concerned. 

"but, let me first finish the story of my experimental dose, for i took 
it again the third night, and underwent a very similar experience, 
delay like the first in coming, and then carry me off my feet when 
it did come with a rush of this false demon-laughter. this time, 
however, there was a reversal of the change scale of space and time; it 
shorten instead of lengthened, so that i dress and got downstairs in 
about twenty seconds, and the couple of hour i stay and work in the 
study pass literally like a period of ten minutes." 

"that is often true of an overdose," interject the doctor, "and you 
may go a mile in a few minutes, or a few yard in a quarter of an hour. 
it is quite incomprehensible to those who have never experienced it, and 
is a curious proof that time and space are merely form of thought." 

"this time," pender went on, talk more and more rapid in his 
excitement, "another extraordinary effect came to me, and i experienced 
a curious change of the senses, so that i perceive external things 
through one large main sense-channel instead of through the five 
division known as sight, smell, touch, and so forth. you will, i know, 
understand me when i tell you that i _heard_ sight and _saw_ sounds. no 
language can make this comprehensible, of course, and i can only say, 
for instance, that the striking of the clock i saw as a visible picture 
in the air before me. i saw the sound of the tinkle bell. and in 
precisely the same way i heard the colours in the room, especially the 
colours of those books in the shelf behind you. those red binding i 
heard in deep sounds, and the yellow cover of the france binding next 
to them made a shrill, piercing note not unlike the chatter of 
starlings. that brown bookcase muttered, and those green curtains 
opposite kept up a constant sort of ripple sound like the lower note 
of a wood-horn. but i only was conscious of these sound when i look 
steady at the different objects, and thought about them. the room, you 
understand, was not full of a chorus of notes; but when i concentrated 
my mind upon a colour, i heard, as well as saw, it." 

"that is a known, though rarely obtained, effect of _cannabis indica_," 
observe the doctor. "and it provoke laughter again, did it?" 

"only the mutter of the cupboard-bookcase made me laugh. it was so 
like a great animal try to get itself noticed, and made me think of a 
perform bear--which is full of a kind of pathetic humour, you know. 
but this mingle of the senses produce no confusion in my brain. on 
the contrary, i was unusually clear-headed and experienced an 
intensify of consciousness, and felt marvellous alive and 
keen-minded. 

"moreover, when i took up a pencil in obedience to an impulse to 
sketch--a talent not normally mine--i found that i could draw nothing 
but heads, nothing, in fact, but one head--always the same--the head of 
a dark-skinned woman, with huge and terrible features and a very 
droop left eye; and so well drawn, too, that i was amazed, as you may 
imagine--" 

"and the expression of the face--?" 

pender hesitate a moment for words, casting about with his hand in the 
air and hunch his shoulders. a perceptible shudder ran over him. 

"what i can only describe as--_blackness_," he reply in a low tone; 
"the face of a dark and evil soul." 

"you destroy that, too?" query the doctor sharply. 

"no; i have kept the drawings," he said, with a laugh, and rose to get 
them from a drawer in the writing-desk behind him. 

"here is all that remains of the pictures, you see," he added, push a 
number of loose sheet under the doctor's eyes; "nothing but a few 
scraw lines. that's all i found the next morning. i had really drawn 
no head at all--nothing but those lines and blot and wriggles. the 
pictures were entire subjective, and exist only in my mind which 
construct them out of a few wild stroke of the pen. like the alter 
scale of space and time it was a complete delusion. these all passed, of 
course, with the passing of the drug's effects. but the other thing did 
not pass. i mean, the presence of that dark soul remain with me. it is 
here still. it is real. i don't know how i can escape from it." 

"it is attach to the house, not to you personally. you must leave the 
house." 

"yes. only i cannot afford to leave the house, for my work is my sole 
means of support, and--well, you see, since this change i cannot even 
write. they are horrible, these mirthless tale i now write, with their 
mockery of laughter, their diabolical suggestion. horrible? i shall go 
mad if this continues." 

he screw his face up and look about the room as though he expect 
to see some haunting shape. 

"this influence in this house induce by my experiment, has kill in a 
flash, in a sudden stroke, the source of my humour, and though i still 
go on writing funny tales--i have a certain name you know--my 
inspiration has dry up, and much of what i write i have to burn--yes, 
doctor, to burn, before any one see it." 

"as utterly alien to your own mind and personality?" 

"utterly! as though some one else had written it--" 

"ah!" 

"and shocking!" he pass his hand over his eyes a moment and let the 
breath escape soft through his teeth. "yet most damnable clever in the 
consummate way the vile suggestion are insinuate under cover of a kind 
of high drollery. my stenographer left me of course--and i've been 
afraid to take another--" 

john silence got up and began to walk about the room leisurely without 
speaking; he appear to be examine the pictures on the wall and 
reading the name of the books lie about. presently he pause on the 
hearthrug, with his back to the fire, and turn to look his patient 
quiet in the eyes. pender's face was grey and drawn; the hunt 
expression dominate it; the long recital had told upon him. 

"thank you, mr. pender," he said, a curious glow showing about his fine, 
quiet face; "thank you for the sincerity and frank of your account. 
but i think now there is nothing further i need ask you." he indulge in 
a long scrutiny of the author's haggard features drawing purposely the 
man's eyes to his own and then meeting them with a look of power and 
confidence calculate to inspire even the feeblest soul with courage. 
"and, to begin with," he added, smile pleasantly, "let me assure you 
without delay that you need have no alarm, for you are no more insane or 
delude than i myself am--" 

pender heave a deep sigh and try to return the smile. 

"--and this is simply a case, so far as i can judge at present, of a 
very singular psychic invasion, and a very sinister one, too, if you 
perhaps understand what i mean--" 

"it's an odd expression; you use it before, you know," said the author 
wearily, yet eager listen to every word of the diagnosis, and 
deep touched by the intelligent sympathy which did not at once 
indicate the lunatic asylum. 

"possibly," return the other, "and an odd affliction, too, you'll 
allow, yet one not unknown to the nation of antiquity, nor to those 
moderns, perhaps, who recognise the freedom of action under certain 
pathogenic conditions between this world and another." 

"and you think," ask pender hastily, "that it is all primarily due to 
the _cannabis_? there is nothing radical amiss with myself--nothing 
incurable, or--?" 

"due entire to the overdose," dr. silence reply emphatically, "to 
the drug's direct action upon your psychic being. it render you 
ultra-sensitive and made you respond to an increase rate of vibration. 
and, let me tell you, mr. pender, that your experiment might have had 
result far more dire. it has brought you into touch with a somewhat 
singular class of invisible, but of one, i think, chiefly human in 
character. you might, however, just as easily have been drawn out of 
human range altogether, and the result of such a contingency would have 
been exceedingly terrible. indeed, you would not now be here to tell the 
tale. i need not alarm you on that score, but mention it as a warning 
you will not misunderstand or underrate after what you have been 
through. 

"you look puzzled. you do not quite gather what i am driving at; and it 
is not to be expect that you should, for you, i suppose, are the 
nominal christian with the nominal christian's lofty standard of ethics, 
and his utter ignorance of spiritual possibilities. beyond a somewhat 
childish understanding of 'spiritual wicked in high places,' you 
probably have no conception of what is possible once you break-down the 
slender gulf that is merciful fixed between you and that outer world. 
but my study and training have taken me far outside these orthodox 
trips, and i have made experiment that i could scarcely speak to you 
about in language that would be intelligible to you." 

he pause a moment to note the breathless interest of pender's face and 
manner. every word he utter was calculated; he knew exactly the value 
and effect of the emotion he desire to waken in the heart of the 
afflict being before him. 

"and from certain knowledge i have gain through various experiences," 
he continue calmly, "i can diagnose your case as i said before to be 
one of psychic invasion." 

"and the nature of this--er--invasion?" stammer the bewilder writer 
of humorous tales. 

"there is no reason why i should not say at once that i do not yet quite 
know," reply dr. silence. "i may first have to make one or two 
experiments--" 

"on me?" gasp pender, catching his breath. 

"not exactly," the doctor said, with a grave smile, "but with your 
assistance, perhaps. i shall want to test the conditions of the 
house--to ascertain, impossible, the character of the forces, of this 
strange personality that has been haunting you--" 

"at present you have no idea exactly who--what--why--" ask the 
other in a wild flurry of interest, dread and amazement. 

"i have a very good idea, but no proof rather," return the doctor. 
"the effects of the drug in alter the scale of time and space, and 
merge the senses have nothing primarily to do with the invasion. they 
come to any one who is fool enough to take an experimental dose. it is 
the other features of your case that are unusual. you see, you are now 
in touch with certain violent emotions, desires, purposes, still active 
in this house, that were produce in the past by some powerful and evil 
personality that live here. how long ago, or why they still persist so 
forcibly, i cannot positively say. but i should judge that they are 
merely forces acting automatic with the momentum of their terrific 
original impetus." 

"not direct by a living being, a conscious will, you mean?" 

"possibly not--but none the less dangerous on that account, and more 
difficult to deal with. i cannot explain to you in a few minutes the 
nature of such things, for you have not made the study that would 
enable you to follow me; but i have reason to believe that on the 
dissolution at death of a human being, its forces may still persist and 
continue to act in a blind, unconscious fashion. as a rule they speedy 
dissipate themselves, but in the case of a very powerful personality 
they may last a long time. and, in some cases--of which i incline to 
think this is one--these forces may coalesce with certain non-human 
entity who thus continue their life indefinitely and increase their 
strength to an unbelievable degree. if the original personality was 
evil, the being attract to the left-over forces will also be evil. in 
this case, i think there has been an unusual and dreadful aggrandisement 
of the thought and purpose left behind long ago by a woman of 
consummate wicked and great personal power of character and 
intellect. now, do you begin to see what i am driving at a little?" 

pender stare fixedly at his companion, plain horror showing in his 
eyes. but he found nothing to say, and the doctor continued-- 

"in your case, predispose by the action of the drug, you have 
experienced the rush of these forces in undiluted strength. they wholly 
obliterate in you the sense of humour, fancy, imagination,--all that 
make for cheerful and hope. they seek, though perhaps automatic 
only, to oust your own thought and establish themselves in their place. 
you are the victim of a psychic invasion. at the same time, you have 
become clairvoyant in the true sense. you are also a clairvoyant 
victim." 

pender mop his face and sighed. he left his chair and went over to 
the fireplace to warm himself. 

"you must think me a quack to talk like this, or a madman," laugh dr. 
silence. "but never mind that. i have come to help you, and i can help 
you if you will do what i tell you. it is very simple: you must leave 
this house at once. oh, never mind the difficulties; we will deal with 
those together. i can place another house at your disposal, or i would 
take the lease here off your hands, and later have it pull down. your 
case interests me greatly, and i mean to see you through, so that you 
have no anxiety, and can drop back into your old groove of work 
tomorrow! the drug has provided you, and therefore me, with a shortcut 
to a very interesting experience. i am grateful to you." 

the author poke the fire vigorously, emotion rising in him like a 
tide. he glance towards the door nervously. 

"there is no need to alarm your wife or to tell her the detail of our 
conversation," pursue the other quietly. "let her know that you will 
soon be in possession again of your sense of humour and your health, and 
explain that i am lend you another house for six months. meanwhile i 
may have the right to use this house for a night or two for my 
experiment. is that understood between us?" 

"i can only thank you from the bottom of my heart," stammer pender, 
unable to find words to express his gratitude. 

then he hesitate for a moment, searching the doctor's face anxiously. 

"and your experiment with the house?" he said at length. 

"of the simplest character, my dear mr. pender. although i am myself an 
artificial train psychic, and consequently aware of the presence of 
discarnate entity as a rule, i have so far felt nothing here at all. 
this make me sure that the forces acting here are of an unusual 
description. what i propose to do is to make an experiment with a view 
of drawing out this evil, coax it from its lair, so to speak, in 
order that it may _exhaust itself through me_ and become dissipated for 
ever. i have already been inoculated," he added; "i consider myself to 
be immune." 

"heavens above!" gasp the author, collapse on to a chair. 

"hell beneath! might be a more appropriate exclamation," the doctor 
laughed. "but, seriously, mr. pender, this is what i propose to do--with 
your permission." 

"of course, of course," cry the other, "you have my permission and my 
best wish for success. i can see no possible objection, but--" 

"but what?" 

"i pray to heaven you will not undertake this experiment alone, will 
you?" 

"oh, dear, no; not alone." 

"you will take a companion with good nerves, and reliable in case of 
disaster, won't you?" 

"i shall bring two companions," the doctor said. 

"ah, that's better. i feel easier. i am sure you must have among your 
acquaintance men who--" 

"i shall not think of bring men, mr. pender." 

the other look up sharply. 

"no, or women either; or children." 

"i don't understand. who will you bring, then?" 

"animals," explain the doctor, unable to prevent a smile at his 
companion's expression of surprise--"two animals, a cat and a dog." 

pender stare as if his eyes would drop out upon the floor, and then 
led the way without another word into the adjoin room where his wife 
was await them for tea. 


ii 

a few days later the humorist and his wife, with mind greatly relieved, 
move into a small furnish house placed at their free disposal in 
another part of london; and john silence, intent upon his approach 
experiment, made ready to spend a night in the empty house on the top of 
putney hill. only two rooms were prepared for occupation: the study on 
the ground floor and the bedroom immediately above it; all other door 
were to be locked, and no servant was to be left in the house. the motor 
had orders to call for him at nine o'clock the following morning. 

and, meanwhile, his secretary had instruction to look up the past 
history and association of the place, and learn everything he could 
concerning the character of former occupants, recent or remote. 

the animals, by whose sensitive he intended to test any unusual 
conditions in the atmosphere of the building, dr. silence select with 
care and judgment. he believe (and had already made curious experiment 
to prove it) that animal were more often, and more truly, clairvoyant 
than human beings. many of them, he felt convinced, possessed powers of 
perception far superior to that mere keen of the senses common to 
all dwell in the wild where the senses grow specially alert; they 
had what he term "animal clairvoyance," and from his experiment with 
horses, dogs, cats, and even birds, he had drawn certain deductions, 
which, however, need not be refer to in detail here. 

cats, in particular, he believed, were almost continuous conscious of 
a large field of vision, too detailed even for a photographic camera, 
and quite beyond the reach of normal human organs. he had, further, 
observe that while dogs were usually terrify in the presence of such 
phenomena, cat on the other hand were soothe and satisfied. they 
welcome manifestation as something belong peculiarly to their own 
region. 

he select his animals, therefore, with wisdom so that they might 
afford a differ test, each in its own way, and that one should not 
merely communicate its own excitement to the other. he took a dog and a 
cat. 

the cat he chose, now full grown, had live with him since kittenhood, a 
kittenhood of perplex sweet and audacious mischief. wayward it 
was and fanciful, ever play its own mysterious games in the corner 
of the room, jump at invisible nothings, leap sideways into the 
air and fall with tiny moccasin feet on to another part of the 
carpet, yet with an air of dignified earnest which show that the 
performance was necessary to its own well-being, and not done merely to 
impress a stupid human audience. in the middle of elaborate washing it 
would look up, startled, as though to stare at the approach of some 
invisible, cock its little head sideways and putt out a velvet pad 
to inspect cautiously. then it would get absent-minded, and stare with 
equal intent in another direction (just to confuse the onlookers), 
and sudden go on furiously washing its body again, but in quite a new 
place. except for a white patch on its breast it was coal black. and its 
name was--smoke. 

"smoke" describe its temperament as well as its appearance. its 
movements, its individuality, its pose as a little furry mass of 
conceal mysteries, its elfin-like elusiveness, all combine to justify 
its name; and a subtle painter might have picture it as a wisp of 
floating smoke, the fire below betray itself at two points only--the 
glowing eyes. 

all its forces ran to intelligence--secret intelligence, the wordless 
incalculable intuition of the cat. it was, indeed, _the_ cat for the 
business in hand. 

the selection of the dog was not so simple, for the doctor own many; 
but after much deliberation he chose a collie, call flame from his 
yellow coat. true, it was a trifle old, and stiff in the joints, and 
even beginning to grow deaf, but, on the other hand, it was a very 
particular friend of smoke's, and had father it from kittenhood 
upwards so that a subtle understanding exist between them. it was this 
that turn the balance in its favour, this and its courage. moreover, 
though good-tempered, it was a terrible fighter, and its anger when 
provoke by a righteous cause was a fury of fire, and irresistible. 

it had come to him quite young, straight from the shepherd, with the air 
of the hill yet in its nostrils, and was then little more than skin and 
bone and teeth. for a collie it was sturdy built, its nose blunt 
than most, its yellow hair stiff rather than silky, and it had full 
eyes, unlike the slit eyes of its breed. only its master could touch it, 
for it ignore strangers, and despise their pattings--when any dare to 
pat it. there was something patriarchal about the old beast. he was in 
earnest, and went through life with tremendous energy and big things in 
view, as though he had the reputation of his whole race to uphold. and 
to watch him fight against odds was to understand why he was 
terrible. 

in his relations with smoke he was always absurd gentle; also he was 
fatherly; and at the same time betray a certain diffidence or shyness. 
he recognise that smoke call for strong yet respectful management. 
the cat's circuitous method puzzle him, and his elaborate pretence 
perhaps shock the dog's liking for direct, undisguised action. yet, 
while he fail to comprehend these tortuous feline mysteries, he was 
never contemptuous or condescending; and he preside over the safety of 
his furry black friend somewhat as a father, loving, but intuitive, 
might superintend the vagary of a wayward and talented child. and, in 
return, smoke reward him with exhibition of fascinating and audacious 
mischief. 

and these brief description of their character are necessary for the 
proper understanding of what subsequent took place. 

with smoke sleep in the fold of his fur coat, and the collie lie 
watchful on the seat opposite, john silence went down in his motor after 
dinner on the night of november 15th. 

and the fog was so dense that they were oblige to travel at quarter 
speed the entire way. 

* * * * * 

it was after ten o'clock when he dismiss the motor and enter the 
dingy little house with the latchkey provided by pender. he found the 
hall gas turn low, and a fire in the study. books and food had also 
been placed ready by the servant according to instructions. coil of fog 
rush in after him through the open door and fill the hall and 
passage with its cold discomfort. 

the first thing dr. silence did was to lock up smoke in the study with a 
saucer of milk before the fire, and then make a search of the house with 
flame. the dog ran cheerful behind him all the way while he try the 
door of the other rooms to make sure they were locked. he nose about 
into corner and made little excursion on his own account. his manner 
was expectant. he knew there must be something unusual about the 
proceeding, because it was contrary to the habit of his whole life not 
to be asleep at this hour on the mat in front of the fire. he kept 
look up into his master's face, as door after door was tried, with an 
expression of intelligent sympathy, but at the same time a certain air 
of disapproval. yet everything his master did was good in his eyes, and 
he betray as little impatience as possible with all this unnecessary 
journey to and fro. if the doctor was pleased to play this sort of 
game at such an hour of the night, it was surely not for him to object. 
so he play it, too; and was very busy and earnest about it into the 
bargain. 

after an uneventful search they came down again to the study, and here 
dr. silence discover smoke washing his face calm in front of the 
fire. the saucer of milk was lick dry and clean; the preliminary 
examination that cat always make in new surroundings had evidently 
been satisfactory concluded. he drew an arm-chair up to the fire, 
stir the coal into a blaze, arrange the table and lamp to his 
satisfaction for reading, and then prepared surreptitious to watch the 
animals. he wish to observe them careful without their being aware 
of it. 

now, in spite of their respective ages, it was the regular custom of 
these two to play together every night before sleep. smoke always made 
the advances, beginning with grave impudence to pat the dog's tail, and 
flame play cumbrously, with condescension. it was his duty, rather 
than pleasure; he was glad when it was over, and sometimes he was very 
determined and refuse to play at all. 

and this night was one of the occasion on which he was firm. 

the doctor, look cautious over the top of his book, watch the cat 
begin the performance. it start by gaze with an innocent expression 
at the dog where he lay with nose on paw and eyes wide open in the 
middle of the floor. then it got up and made as though it meant to walk 
to the door, go deliberate and very softly. flame's eyes follow 
it until it was beyond the range of sight, and then the cat turn 
sharp and began pat his tail tentative with one paw. the tail 
move slightly in reply, and smoke change paw and tap it again. the 
dog, however, did not rise to play as was his wont, and the cat fell to 
parting it brisk with both paws. flame still lay motionless. 

this puzzle and bore the cat, and it went round and stare hard into 
its friend's face to see what was the matter. perhaps some inarticulate 
message flash from the dog's eyes into its own little brain, making it 
understand that the programme for the night had better not begin with 
play. perhaps it only realise that its friend was immovable. but, 
whatever the reason, its usual persistence thenceforward desert it, 
and it made no further attempt at persuasion. smoke yield at once to 
the dog's mood; it sat down where it was and began to wash. 

but the washing, the doctor noted, was by no means its real purpose; it 
only use it to mask something else; it stop at the most busy and 
furious moments and began to stare about the room. its thought wander 
absurdly. it peer intent at the curtains; at the shadowy corners; at 
empty space above; leave its body in curious awkward position for 
whole minutes together. then it turn sharp and stare with a sudden 
signal of intelligence at the dog, and flame at once rose somewhat 
stiff to his feet and began to wander aimless and restless to and 
fro about the floor. smoke follow him, padding quiet at his heels. 
between them they made what seem to be a deliberate search of the 
room. 

and, here, as he watch them, note careful every detail of the 
performance over the top of his book, yet making no effort to 
interfere, it seem to the doctor that the first beginning of a faint 
distress betray themselves in the collie, and in the cat the stirring 
of a vague excitement. 

he observe them closely. the fog was thick in the air, and the tobacco 
smoke from his pipe add to its density; the furniture at the far end 
stood mistily, and where the shadow congregate in hanging cloud under 
the ceiling, it was difficult to see clearly at all; the lamplight only 
reach to a level of five feet from the floor, above which came layer 
of comparative darkness, so that the room appear twice as lofty as it 
actually was. by means of the lamp and the fire, however, the carpet was 
everywhere clearly visible. 

the animal made their silent tour of the floor, sometimes the dog 
leading, sometimes the cat; occasional they look at one another as 
though exchange signals; and once or twice, in spite of the limited 
space, he lost sight of one or other among the fog and the shadows. 
their curiosity, it appear to him, was something more than the 
excitement lurk in the unknown territory of a strange room; yet, so 
far, it was impossible to test this, and he purposely kept his mind 
quiet receptive lest the smallest mental excitement on his part should 
communicate itself to the animal and thus destroy the value of their 
independent behaviour. 

they made a very thorough journey, leave no piece of furniture 
unexamined, or unsmelt. flame led the way, walking slow with lower 
head, and smoke follow demure at his heels, making a transparent 
pretence of not being interested, yet missing nothing. and, at length, 
they returned, the old collie first, and came to rest on the mat before 
the fire. flame rest his muzzle on his master's knee, smile 
beatific while he pat the yellow head and spoke his name; and 
smoke, coming a little later, pretend he came by chance, look from 
the empty saucer to his face, lap up the milk when it was given him 
to the last drop, and then sprang upon his knee and curl round for 
the sleep it had fully earn and intended to enjoy. 

silence descended upon the room. only the breathing of the dog upon the 
mat came through the deep stillness, like the pulse of time marking the 
minutes; and the steady drip, drip of the fog outside upon the 
window-ledges dismal testify to the inclement of the night beyond. 
and the soft crashing of the coal as the fire settled down into the 
grate became less and less audible as the fire sank and the flame 
resigned their fierceness. 

it was now well after eleven o'clock, and dr. silence devoted himself 
again to his book. he read the words on the print page and took in 
their meaning superficially, yet without start into life the 
correlation of thought and suggestion that should accompany 
interesting reading. underneath, all the while, his mental energy were 
absorb in watching, listening, wait for what might come. he was not 
over-sanguine himself, yet he did not wish to be taken by surprise. 
moreover, the animals, his sensitive barometers, had incontinent gone 
to sleep. 

after reading a dozen pages, however, he realise that his mind was 
really occupy in review the features of pender's extraordinary 
story, and that it was no long necessary to steady his imagination by 
study the dull paragraph detailed in the page before him. he laid 
down his book accordingly, and allow his thought to dwell upon the 
features of the case. speculation as to the meaning, however, he 
rigorous suppressed, knowing that such thought would act upon his 
imagination like wind upon the glowing ember of a fire. 

as the night wore on the silence grew deep and deeper, and only at 
rare interval he heard the sound of wheels on the main road a hundred 
yard away, where the horse went at a walking pace owe to the density 
of the fog. the echo of pedestrian footstep no long reach him, the 
clamour of occasional voice no long came down the side street. the 
night, muffle by fog, shroud by veil of ultimate mystery, hung about 
the haunt villa like a doom. nothing in the house stirred. stillness, 
in a thick blanket, lay over the upper storeys. only the mist in the 
room grew more dense, he thought, and the damp cold more penetrating. 
certainly, from time to time, he shivered. 

the collie, now deep in slumber, move occasionally,--grunted, sighed, 
or twitch his leg in dreams. smoke lay on his knees, a pool of warm, 
black fur, only the closest observation detect the movement of his 
sleek sides. it was difficult to distinguish exactly where his head and 
body join in that circle of glisten hair; only a black satin nose 
and a tiny tip of pink tongue betray the secret. 

dr. silence watch him, and felt comfortable. the collie's breathing 
was soothing. the fire was well built, and would burn for another two 
hour without attention. he was not conscious of the least nervousness. 
he particularly wish to remain in his ordinary and normal state of 
mind, and to force nothing. if sleep came naturally, he would let it 
come--and even welcome it. the cold of the room, when the fire die 
down later, would be sure to wake him again; and it would then be time 
enough to carry these sleep barometer up to bed. from various 
psychic premonition he knew quite well that the night would not pass 
without adventure; but he did not wish to force its arrival; and he 
wish to remain normal, and let the animal remain normal, so that, 
when it came, it would be unattended by excitement or by any strain 
of the attention. many experiment had made him wise. and, for the rest, 
he had no fear. 

accordingly, after a time, he did fall asleep as he had expected, and 
the last thing he remembered, before oblivion slip up over his eyes 
like soft wool, was the picture of flame stretch all four leg at 
once, and sigh noisy as he sought a more comfortable position for 
his paw and muzzle upon the mat. 

* * * * * 

it was a good deal later when he became aware that a weight lay upon his 
chest, and that something was pencil over his face and mouth. a soft 
touch on the cheek woke him. something was pat him. 

he sat up with a jerk, and found himself staring straight into a pair of 
brilliant eyes, half green, half black. smoke's face lay level with his 
own; and the cat had climb up with its front paw upon his chest. 

the lamp had burn low and the fire was nearly out, yet dr. silence saw 
in a moment that the cat was in an excited state. it knead with its 
front paw into his chest, shift from one to the other. he felt them 
prod against him. it lift a leg very careful and pat his 
cheek gingerly. its fur, he saw, was standing ridgewise upon its back; 
the ear were flatten back somewhat; the tail was switch sharply. 
the cat, of course, had waken him with a purpose, and the instant he 
realise this, he set it upon the arm of the chair and sprang up with a 
quick turn to face the empty room behind him. by some curious instinct, 
his arms of their own accord assume an attitude of defence in front of 
him, as though to ward off something that threaten his safety. yet 
nothing was visible. only shape of fog hung about rather heavy in the 
air, moving slightly to and fro. 

his mind was now fully alert, and the last vestige of sleep gone. he 
turn the lamp higher and peer about him. two things he became aware 
of at once: one, that smoke, while excited, was _pleasurably_ excited; 
the other, that the collie was no long visible upon the mat at his 
feet. he had crept away to the corner of the wall farthest from the 
window, and lay watch the room with wide-open eyes, in which lurk 
plainly something of alarm. 

something in the dog's behaviour instantly struck dr. silence as 
unusual, and, calling him by name, he move across to pat him. flame got 
up, wag his tail, and came over slow to the rug, utter a low 
sound that was half growl, half whine. he was evidently perturb about 
something, and his master was proceeding to administer comfort when his 
attention was sudden drawn to the antics of his other four-footed 
companion, the cat. 

and what he saw fill him with something like amazement. 

smoke had jump down from the back of the arm-chair and now occupy 
the middle of the carpet, where, with tail erect and leg stiff as 
ramrods, it was steady pace backwards and forward in a narrow 
space, uttering, as it did so, those curious little guttural sound of 
pleasure that only an animal of the feline species know how to make 
expressive of supreme happiness. its stiffen leg and arch back made 
it appear large than usual, and the black visage wore a smile of 
beatific joy. its eyes blaze magnificently; it was in an ecstasy. 

at the end of every few pace it turn sharp and stalk back again 
along the same line, padding softly, and purr like a roll of little 
muffle drums. it behave precisely as though it were rubbing against 
the ankle of some one who remain invisible. a thrill ran down the 
doctor's spine as he stood and stared. his experiment was grow 
interesting at last. 

he call the collie's attention to his friend's performance to see 
whether he too was aware of anything standing there upon the carpet, and 
the dog's behaviour was significant and corroborative. he came as far as 
his master's knee and then stop dead, refuse to investigate 
closely. in vain dr. silence urge him; he wag his tail, whine a 
little, and stood in a half-crouching attitude, staring alternate at 
the cat and at his master's face. he was, apparently, both puzzle and 
alarmed, and the whine went deep and deep down into his throat till 
it change into an ugly snarl of awakening anger. 

then the doctor call to him in a tone of command he had never known to 
be disregarded; but still the dog, though spring up in response, 
decline to move nearer. he made tentative motions, prance a little 
like a dog about to take to water, pretended to bark, and ran to and fro 
on the carpet. so far there was no actual fear in his manner, but he was 
uneasy and anxious, and nothing would induce him to go within touching 
distance of the walking cat. once he made a complete circuit, but always 
careful out of reach; and in the end he return to his master's leg 
and rub vigorous against him. flame did not like the performance at 
all: that much was quite clear. 

for several minutes john silence watch the performance of the cat with 
profound attention and without interfering. then he call to the animal 
by name. 

"smoke, you mysterious beastie, what in the world are you about?" he 
said, in a coax tone. 

the cat look up at him for a moment, smile in its ecstasy, blinking 
its eyes, but too happy to pause. he spoke to it again. he call to it 
several times, and each time it turn upon him its blazing eyes, drunk 
with inner delight, opening and shut its lips, its body large and 
rigid with excitement. yet it never for one instant pause in its short 
journey to and fro. 

he noted exactly what it did: it walked, he saw, the same number of 
pace each time, some six or seven steps, and then it turn sharp and 
retrace them. by the pattern of the great rose in the carpet he 
measured it. it kept to the same direction and the same line. it behave 
precisely as though it were rubbing against something solid. 
undoubtedly, there was something standing there on that strip of carpet, 
something invisible to the doctor, something that alarm the dog, yet 
cause the cat unspeakable pleasure. 

"smokie!" he call again, "smokie, you black mystery, what is it 
excite you so?" 

again the cat look up at him for a brief second, and then continue 
its sentry-walk, blissful happy, intense preoccupied. and, for an 
instant, as he watch it, the doctor was aware that a faint uneasy 
stir in the depths of his own being, focus itself for the moment 
upon this curious behaviour of the uncanny creature before him. 

there rose in him quite a new realisation of the mystery connected with 
the whole feline tribe, but especially with that common member of it, 
the domestic cat--their hidden lives, their strange aloofness, their 
incalculable subtlety. how utterly remote from anything that human 
being understood lay the source of their elusive activities. as he 
watch the indescribable bearing of the little creature mince along 
the strip of carpet under his eyes, coquette with the powers of 
darkness, welcoming, maybe, some fearsome visitor, there stir in his 
heart a feeling strange akin to awe. its indifference to human kind, 
its serene superior to the obvious, struck him forcibly with fresh 
meaning; so remote, so inaccessible seem the secret purpose of its 
real life, so alien to the blunder honesty of other animals. its 
absolute poise of bearing brought into his mind the opium-eater's words 
that "no dignity is perfect which do not at some point ally itself 
with the mysterious"; and he became sudden aware that the presence of 
the dog in this foggy, haunt room on the top of putney hill was 
uncommonly welcome to him. he was glad to feel that flame's dependable 
personality was with him. the savage growl at his heel was a 
pleasant sound. he was glad to hear it. that march cat made him 
uneasy. 

finding that smoke paid no further attention to his words, the doctor 
decided upon action. would it rub against his leg, too? he would take it 
by surprise and see. 

he step quick forward and placed himself upon the exact strip of 
carpet where it walked. 

but no cat is ever taken by surprise! the moment he occupy the space 
of the intruder, setting his feet on the woven rose midway in the line 
of travel, smoke sudden stop purr and sat down. if lift up its 
face with the most innocent stare imaginable of its green eyes. he could 
have sworn it laughed. it was a perfect child again. in a single second 
it had resume its simple, domestic manner; and it gaze at him in such 
a way that he almost felt smoke was the normal being, and _his_ was the 
eccentric behaviour that was being watched. it was consummate, the 
manner in which it brought about this change so easily and so quickly. 

"superb little actor!" he laugh in spite of himself, and stoop to 
stroke the shining black back. but, in a flash, as he touched its fur, 
the cat turn and spat at him viciously, striking at his hand with one 
paw. then, with a hurried scut of feet, it shot like a shadow across 
the floor and a moment later was calm sitting over by the 
window-curtains washing its face as though nothing interested it in the 
whole world but the clean of its cheek and whiskers. 

john silence straighten himself up and drew a long breath. he realise 
that the performance was temporary at an end. the collie, meanwhile, 
who had watch the whole proceeding with marked disapproval, had now 
lain down again upon the mat by the fire, no long growling. it seem 
to the doctor just as though something that had enter the room while 
he slept, alarm the dog, yet bring happiness to the cat, had now 
gone out again, leave all as it was before. whatever it was that 
excited its blissful attention had retreat for the moment. 

he realise this intuitively. smoke evidently realise it, too, for 
presently he deign to march back to the fireplace and jump upon his 
master's knees. dr. silence, patient and determined, settled down once 
more to his book. the animal soon slept; the fire blaze cheerfully; 
and the cold fog from outside pour into the room through every 
available chink and crannie. 

for a long time silence and peace reign in the room and dr. silence 
avail himself of the quiet to make careful note of what had 
happened. he enter for future use in other case an exhaustive 
analysis of what he had observed, especially with regard to the effect 
upon the two animals. it is impossible here, nor would it be 
intelligible to the reader unversed in the knowledge of the region known 
to a scientific train psychic like dr. silence, to detail these 
observations. but to him it was clear, up to a certain point--for the 
rest he must still wait and watch. so far, at least, he realise that 
while he slept in the chair--that is, while his will was dormant--the 
room had suffer intrusion from what he recognise as an intense 
active force, and might later be forced to acknowledge as something more 
than merely a blind force, namely, a distinct personality. 

so far it had affected himself scarcely at all, but had act directly 
upon the simple organism of the animals. it stimulate keen the 
centre of the cat's psychic being, induce a state of instant 
happiness (intensifying its consciousness probably in the same way a 
drug or stimulant intensify that of a human being); whereas it alarm 
the less sensitive dog, cause it to feel a vague apprehension and 
distress. 

his own sudden action and exhibition of energy had serve to disperse it 
temporarily, yet he felt convinced--the indication were not lacking 
even while he sat there making notes--that it still remain near to 
him, conditional if not spatially, and was, as it were, gathering 
force for a second attack. 

and, further, he intuitive understood that the relations between the 
two animal had undergone a subtle change: that the cat had become 
immeasurable superior, confident, sure of itself in its own peculiar 
region, whereas flame had been weaken by an attack he could not 
comprehend and knew not how to reply to. though not yet afraid, he was 
defiant--ready to act against a fear that he felt to be approaching. he 
was no long fatherly and protective towards the cat. smoke held the 
key to the situation; and both he and the cat knew it. 

thus, as the minutes passed, john silence sat and waited, keen on the 
alert, wonder how soon the attack would be renewed, and at what point 
it would be divert from the animal and direct upon himself. 

the book lay on the floor beside him, his note were complete. with one 
hand on the cat's fur, and the dog's front paw rest against his 
feet, the three of them doze comfortable before the hot fire while the 
night wore on and the silence deepen towards midnight. 

it was well after one o'clock in the morning when dr. silence turn the 
lamp out and light the candle preparatory to go up to bed. then 
smoke sudden woke with a loud sharp purr and sat up. it neither 
stretched, wash nor turned: it listened. and the doctor, watch it, 
realise that a certain indefinable change had come about that very 
moment in the room. a swift readjust of the forces within the four 
wall had taken place--a new disposition of their personal equations. 
the balance was destroyed, the former harmony gone. smoke, most 
sensitive of barometers, had been the first to feel it, but the dog was 
not slow to follow suit, for on look down he noted that flame was no 
long asleep. he was lie with eyes wide open, and that same instant 
he sat up on his great haunch and began to growl. 

dr. silence was in the act of taking the match to re-light the lamp 
when an audible movement in the room behind him made him pause. smoke 
leap down from his knee and move forward a few pace across the 
carpet. then it stop and stare fixedly; and the doctor stood up on 
the rug to watch. 

as he rose the sound was repeated, and he discover that it was not in 
the room as he first thought, but outside, and that it came from more 
directions than one. there was a rushing, sweeping noise against the 
window-panes, and simultaneous a sound of something brush against 
the door--out in the hall. smoke advanced sedate across the carpet, 
twitch his tail, and sat down within a foot of the door. the 
influence that had destroy the harmonious conditions of the room had 
apparently move in advance of its cause. clearly, something was about 
to happen. 

for the first time that night john silence hesitated; the thought of 
that dark narrow hall-way, choke with fog, and destitute of human 
comfort, was unpleasant. he became aware of a faint creep of his 
flesh. he knew, of course, that the actual opening of the door was not 
necessary to the invasion of the room that was about to take place, 
since neither door nor windows, nor any other solid barrier could 
interpose an obstacle to what was seek entrance. yet the opening of 
the door would be significant and symbolic, and he distinct shrank 
from it. 

but for a moment only. smoke, turning with a show of impatience, 
recall him to his purpose, and he move past the sitting, watch 
creature, and deliberate open the door to its full width. 

what subsequent happened, happen in the feeble and flicker light 
of the solitary candle on the mantlepiece. 

through the open door he saw the hall, dim lit and thick with fog. 
nothing, of course, was visible--nothing but the hat-stand, the africa 
spear in dark lines upon the wall and the high-backed wooden chair 
standing grotesque underneath on the oilcloth floor. for one instant 
the fog seem to move and thicken oddly; but he set that down to the 
score of the imagination. the door had open upon nothing. 

yet smoke apparently thought otherwise, and the deep growl of the 
collie from the mat at the back of the room seem to confirm his 
judgment. 

for, proud and self-possessed, the cat had again risen to his feet, and 
have advanced to the door, was now usher some one slow into the 
room. nothing could have been more evident. he pace from side to side, 
bowing his little head with great _empressement_ and holding his 
stiffen tail aloft like a flag-staff. he turn this way and that, 
mince to and fro, and showing sign of supreme satisfaction. he was in 
his element. he welcome the intrusion, and apparently reckon that his 
companions, the doctor and the dog, would welcome it likewise. 

the intruder had return for a second attack. 

dr. silence move slow backwards and took up his position on the 
hearthrug, key himself up to a condition of concentrated attention. 

he noted that flame stood beside him, facing the room, with body 
motionless, and head moving swift from side to side with a curious 
sway movement. his eyes were wide open, his back rigid, his neck and 
jaws thrust forward, his leg tense and ready to leap. savage, ready for 
attack or defence, yet dreadfully puzzle and perhaps already a little 
cowed, he stood and stared, the hair on his spine and side positively 
bristle outwards as though a wind play through it. in the dim 
firelight he look like a great yellow-haired wolf, silent, eyes 
shoot dark fire, exceedingly formidable. it was flame, the terrible. 

smoke, meanwhile, advanced from the door towards the middle of the room, 
adopt the very slow pace of an invisible companion. a few feet away 
it stop and began to smile and blink its eyes. there was something 
deliberate coax in its attitude as it stood there undecided on the 
carpet, clearly wish to effect some sort of introduction between the 
intruder and its canine friend and ally. it assume its most winning 
manners, purring, smiling, look persuasive from one to the other, 
and making quick tentative steps first in one direction and then in the 
other. there had always exist such perfect understanding between them 
in everything. surely flame would appreciate smoke's intention now, and 
acquiesce. 

but the old collie made no advances. he bare his teeth, lift his 
lip till the gum showed, and stood stockstill with fixed eyes and 
heave sides. the doctor move a little farther back, watch intent 
the smallest movement, and it was just then he divine sudden from the 
cat's behaviour and attitude that it was not only a single companion it 
had usher into the room, but _several_. it kept crossing over from one 
to the other, look up at each in turn. it sought to win over the dog 
to friendly with them all. the original intruder had come back with 
reinforcements. and at the same time he further realise that the 
intruder was something more than a blind acting force, impersonal 
though destructive. it was a personality, and moreover a great 
personality. and it was accompany for the purpose of assistance by a 
host of other personalities, minor in degree, but similar in kind. 

he brace himself in the corner against the mantelpiece and waited, his 
whole being rouse to defence, for he was now fully aware that the 
attack had spread to include himself as well as the animals, and he 
must be on the alert. he strained his eyes through the foggy atmosphere, 
try in vain to see what the cat and dog saw; but the candlelight 
threw an uncertain and flicker light across the room and his eyes 
discern nothing. on the floor smoke move soft in front of him like 
a black shadow, his eyes gleam as he turn his head, still try 
with many insinuate gesture and much purr to bring about the 
introduction he desired. 

but it was all in vain. flame stood rivet to one spot, motionless as a 
figure carve in stone. 

some minutes passed, during which only the cat moved, and then there 
came a sharp change. flame began to back towards the wall. he move his 
head from side to side as he went, sometimes turning to snap at 
something almost behind him. they were advance upon him, try to 
surround him. his distress became very marked from now onwards, and it 
seem to the doctor that his anger merge into genuine terror and 
became overwhelm by it. the savage growl sound perilous like a 
whine, and more than once he try to dive past his master's legs, as 
though hunting for a way of escape. he was try to avoid something 
that everywhere block the way. 

this terror of the indomitable fighter impress the doctor enormously; 
yet also painfully; stirring his impatience; for he had never before 
seen the dog show sign of give in, and it distress him to witness 
it. he knew, however, that he was not give in easily, and understood 
that it was really impossible for him to gauge the animal's sensation 
properly at all. what flame felt, and saw, must be terrible indeed to 
turn him all at once into a coward. he face something that made him 
afraid of more than his life merely. the doctor spoke a few quick words 
of encouragement to him, and stroke the bristle hair. but without 
much success. the collie seem already beyond the reach of comfort such 
as that, and the collapse of the old dog follow indeed very speedy 
after this. 

and smoke, meanwhile, remain behind, watch the advance, but not 
join in it; sitting, pleased and expectant, considering that all was 
go well and as it wished. it was knead on the carpet with its 
front paws--slowly, laboriously, as though its feet were dip in 
treacle. the sound its claw made as they caught in the thread was 
distinct audible. it was still smiling, blinking, purring. 

sudden the collie utter a poignant short bark and leap heavy to 
one side. his bare teeth trace a line of white through the gloom. 
the next instant he dashed past his master's legs, almost upset his 
balance, and shot out into the room, where he went blunder wildly 
against wall and furniture. but that bark was significant; the doctor 
had heard it before and knew what it meant: for it was the cry of the 
fighter against odds and it meant that the old beast had found his 
courage again. possibly it was only the courage of despair, but at any 
rate the fight would be terrific. and dr. silence understood, too, 
that he dare not interfere. flame must fight his own enemy in his own 
way. 

but the cat, too, had heard that dreadful bark; and it, too, had 
understood. this was more than it had bargain for. across the dim 
shadow of that haunt room there must have pass some secret signal 
of distress between the animals. smoke stood up and look swift about 
him. he utter a piteous meow and trot smart away into the greater 
dark by the windows. what his object was only those endow with the 
spirit-like intelligence of cat might know. but, at any rate, he had at 
last range himself on the side of his friend. and the little beast 
meant business. 

at the same moment the collie manage to gain the door. the doctor saw 
him rush through into the hall like a flash of yellow light. he shot 
across the oilcloth, and tore up the stairs, but in another second he 
appear again, flying down the steps and landing at the bottom in a 
tumble heap, whining, cringing, terrified. the doctor saw him slink 
back into the room again and crawl round by the wall towards the cat. 
was, then, even the staircase occupied? did _they_ stand also in the 
hall? was the whole house crowded from floor to ceiling? 

the thought came to add to the keen distress he felt at the sight of the 
collie's discomfiture. and, indeed, his own personal distress had 
increase in a marked degree during the past minutes, and continue to 
increase steady to the climax. he recognise that the drain on his own 
vitality grew steadily, and that the attack was now direct against 
himself even more than against the defeat dog, and the too much 
deceive cat. 

it all seem so rapid and uncalculated after that--the event that took 
place in this little modern room at the top of putney hill between 
midnight and sunrise--that dr. silence was hardly able to follow and 
remember it all. it came about with such uncanny swift and terror; 
the light was so uncertain; the movements of the black cat so difficult 
to follow on the dark carpet, and the doctor himself so weary and taken 
by surprise--that he found it almost impossible to observe accurately, 
or to recall afterwards precisely what it was he had seen or in what 
order the incident had taken place. he never could understand what 
defect of vision on his part made it seem as though the cat had 
duplicate itself at first, and then increase indefinitely, so that 
there were at least a dozen of them dart silent about the floor, 
leap soft on to chair and tables, passing like shadow from the 
open door to the end of the room, all black as sin, with brilliant green 
eyes flash fire in all directions. it was like the reflection from a 
score of mirror placed round the wall at different angles. nor could 
he make out at the time why the size of the room seem to have altered, 
grown much larger, and why it extend away behind him where ordinarily 
the wall should have been. the snarl of the enrage and terrify 
collie sound sometimes so far away; the ceiling seem to have raise 
itself so much higher than before, and much of the furniture had change 
in appearance and shift marvellously. 

it was all so confuse and confusing, as though the little room he knew 
had become merge and transform into the dimensions of quite another 
chamber, that came to him, with its host of cat and its strange 
distances, in a sort of vision. 

but these change came about a little later, and at a time when his 
attention was so concentrated upon the proceedings of smoke and the 
collie, that he only observe them, as it were, subconsciously. and the 
excitement, the flicker candlelight, the distress he felt for the 
collie, and the distort atmosphere of fog were the poorest possible 
ally to careful observation. 

at first he was only aware that the dog was repeating his short 
dangerous bark from time to time, snap vicious at the empty air, a 
foot or so from the ground. once, indeed, he sprang upwards and 
forwards, working furiously with teeth and paws, and with a noise like 
wolf fighting, but only to dash back the next minute against the wall 
behind him. then, after lie still for a bit, he rose to a crouch 
position as though to spring again, snarl horrible and making short 
half-circles with lower head. and smoke all the while meow piteous 
by the window as though try to draw the attack upon himself. 

then it was that the rush of the whole dreadful business seem to turn 
aside from the dog and direct itself upon his own person. the collie had 
made another spring and fallen back with a crash into the corner, where 
he made noise enough in his savage rage to waken the dead before he fell 
to whine and then finally lay still. and directly afterwards the 
doctor's own distress became intolerable acute. he had made a half 
movement forward to come to the rescue when a veil that was dense than 
mere fog seem to drop down over the scene, drape room, walls, 
animal and fire in a mist of dark and fold also about his own 
mind. other form move silent across the field of vision, form that 
he recognise from previous experiments, and welcome not. unholy 
thought began to crowd into his brain, sinister suggestion of evil 
present themselves seductively. ice seem to settle about his heart, 
and his mind trembled. he began to lose memory--memory of his identity, 
of where he was, of what he ought to do. the very foundations of his 
strength were shaken. his will seem paralysed. 

and it was then that the room fill with this horde of cats, all dark 
as the night, all silent, all with lamp eyes of green fire. the 
dimensions of the place alter and shifted. he was in a much large 
space. the whine of the dog sound far away, and all about him the 
cat flew busy to and fro, silent play their tearing, rush 
game of evil, weave the pattern of their dark purpose upon the floor. 
he strove hard to collect himself and remember the words of power he had 
made use of before in similar dread position where his dangerous 
practice had sometimes led; but he could recall nothing consecutively; a 
mist lay over his mind and memory; he felt daze and his forces 
scattered. the deep within were too trouble for heal power to come 
out of them. 

it was glamour, of course, he realise afterwards, the strong glamour 
thrown upon his imagination by some powerful personality behind the 
veil; but at the time he was not sufficient aware of this and, as with 
all true glamour, was unable to grasp where the true end and the false 
began. he was caught momentarily in the same vortex that had sought to 
lure the cat to destruction through its delight, and threaten utterly 
to overwhelm the dog through its terror. 

there came a sound in the chimney behind him like wind boom and 
tear its way down. the window rattled. the candle flicker and went 
out. the glacial atmosphere closed round him with the cold of death, and 
a great rush sound swept by overhead as though the ceiling had lift 
to a great height. he heard the door shut. far away it sounded. he felt 
lost, shelterless in the depths of his soul. yet still he held out and 
resist while the climax of the fight came near and nearer.... he had 
step into the stream of forces awaken by pender and he knew that he 
must withstand them to the end or come to a conclusion that it was not 
good for a man to come to. something from the region of utter cold was 
upon him. 

and then quite suddenly, through the confuse mists about him, there 
slow rose up the personality that had been all the time direct the 
battle. some force enter his being that shook him as the tempest 
shakes a leaf, and close against his eyes--clean level with his face--he 
found himself staring into the wreck of a vast dark countenance, a 
countenance that was terrible even in its ruin. 

for ruin it was, and terrible it was, and the mark of spiritual evil 
was brand everywhere upon its broken features. eyes, face and hair 
rose level with his own, and for a space of time he never could properly 
measure, or determine, these two, a man and a woman, look straight 
into each other's visage and down into each other's hearts. 

and john silence, the soul with the good, unselfish motive, held his own 
against the dark discarnate woman whose motive was pure evil, and whose 
soul was on the side of the dark powers. 

it was the climax that touched the depth of power within him and began 
to restore him slow to his own. he was conscious, of course, of 
effort, and yet it seem no superhuman one, for he had recognise the 
character of his opponent's power, and he call upon the good within 
him to meet and overcome it. the inner forces stir and tremble in 
response to his call. they did not at first come readily as was their 
habit, for under the spell of glamour they had already been diabolical 
lull into inactivity, but come they eventually did, rising out of the 
inner spiritual nature he had learned with so much time and pain to 
awaken to life. and power and confidence came with them. he began to 
breathe deep and regularly, and at the same time to absorb into 
himself the forces oppose to him, and to _turn them to his own 
account_. by cease to resist, and allow the deadly stream to pour 
into him unopposed, he use the very power supply by his adversary and 
thus enormously increase his own. 

for this spiritual alchemy he had learned. he understood that force 
ultimately is everywhere one and the same; it is the motive behind that 
make it good or evil; and his motive was entire unselfish. he 
knew--provided he was not first rob of self-control--how vicarious 
to absorb these evil radiation into himself and change them magical 
into his own good purposes. and, since his motive was pure and his soul 
fearless, they could not work him harm. 

thus he stood in the main stream of evil unwitting attract by 
pender, deflect its course upon himself; and after passing through 
the purify filter of his own unselfish these energy could only 
add to his store of experience, of knowledge, and therefore of power. 
and, as his self-control return to him, he gradual accomplished this 
purpose, even though tremble while he did so. 

yet the struggle was severe, and in spite of the freezing chill of the 
air, the perspiration pour down his face. then, by slow degrees, the 
dark and dreadful countenance faded, the glamour pass from his soul, 
the normal proportions return to wall and ceiling, the form melt 
back into the fog, and the whirl of rush shadow-cats disappear 
whence they came. 

and with the return of the consciousness of his own identity john 
silence was restore to the full control of his own will-power. in a 
deep, modulate voice he began to utter certain rhythmic sound that 
slow roll through the air like a rising sea, filling the room with 
powerful vibratory activity that whelme all irregularity of lesser 
vibration in its own swelling tone. he made certain sigils, gesture 
and movements at the same time. for several minutes he continue to 
utter these words, until at length the grow volume dominate the 
whole room and master the manifestation of all that oppose it. for 
just as he understood the spiritual alchemy that can transmute evil 
forces by raise them into higher channels, so he knew from long study 
the occult use of sound, and its direct effect upon the plastic region 
wherein the powers of spiritual evil work their fell purposes. harmony 
was restore first of all to his own soul, and thence to the room and 
all its occupants. 

and, after himself, the first to recognise it was the old dog lie in 
his corner. flame began sudden utter sound of pleasure, that 
"something" between a growl and a grunt that dogs make upon being 
restore to their master's confidence. dr. silence heard the thumping of 
the collie's tail against the floor. and the grunt and the thumping 
touched the depth of affection in the man's heart, and gave him some 
inkling of what agony the dumb creature had suffered. 

next, from the shadow by the window, a somewhat shrill purr 
announce the restoration of the cat to its normal state. smoke was 
advance across the carpet. he seem very pleased with himself, and 
smile with an expression of supreme innocence. he was no shadow-cat, 
but real and full of his usual and perfect self-possession. he march 
along, pick his way delicately, but with a stately dignity that 
suggest his ancestry with the majesty of egypt. his eyes no long 
glared; they shone steady before him, they radiated, not excitement, 
but knowledge. clearly he was anxious to make amends for the mischief to 
which he had unwitting lent himself owe to his subtle and electric 
constitution. 

still utter his sharp high purr he march up to his master and 
rub vigorous against his legs. then he stood on his hind feet and 
paw his knee and stare beseeching up into his face. he turn his 
head towards the corner where the collie still lay, thumping his tail 
feeble and pathetically. 

john silence understood. he bent down and stroke the creature's living 
fur, note the line of bright blue sparks that follow the motion of 
his hand down its back. and then they advanced together towards the 
corner where the dog was. 

smoke went first and put his nose gently against his friend's muzzle, 
purr while he rubbed, and utter little soft sound of affection in 
his throat. the doctor lit the candle and brought it over. he saw the 
collie lie on its side against the wall; it was utterly exhausted, and 
foam still hung about its jaws. its tail and eyes respond to the sound 
of its name, but it was evidently very weak and overcome. smoke 
continue to rub against its cheek and nose and eyes, sometimes even 
standing on its body and knead into the thick yellow hair. flame 
reply from time to time by little lick of the tongue, most of them 
curious misdirected. 

but dr. silence felt intuitive that something disastrous had happened, 
and his heart was wrung. he stroke the dear body, feeling it over for 
bruise or broken bones, but finding none. he fed it with what remain 
of the sandwich and milk, but the creature clumsy upset the saucer 
and lost the sandwich between its paws, so that the doctor had to feed 
it with his own hand. and all the while smoke meow piteously. 

then john silence began to understand. he went across to the farther 
side of the room and call aloud to it. 

"flame, old man! come!" 

at any other time the dog would have been upon him in an instant, 
bark and leap to the shoulder. and even now he got up, though 
heavy and awkwardly, to his feet. he start to run, wag his tail 
more briskly. he collide first with a chair, and then ran straight into 
a table. smoke trot close at his side, try his very best to guide 
him. but it was useless. dr. silence had to lift him up into his own 
arms and carry him like a baby. for he was blind. 


iii 

it was a week later when john silence call to see the author in his 
new house, and found him well on the way to recovery and already busy 
again with his writing. the haunt look had left his eyes, and he 
seem cheerful and confident. 

"humour restored?" laugh the doctor, as soon as they were comfortable 
settled in the room overlook the park. 

"i've had no trouble since i left that dreadful place," return pender 
gratefully; "and thanks to you--" 

the doctor stop him with a gesture. 

"never mind that," he said, "we'll discuss your new plan afterwards, 
and my scheme for relieve you of the house and helping you settle 
elsewhere. of course it must be pull down, for it's not fit for any 
sensitive person to live in, and any other tenant might be afflict in 
the same way you were. although, personally, i think the evil has 
exhaust itself by now." 

he told the astonish author something of his experience in it with 
the animals. 

"i don't pretend to understand," pender said, when the account was 
finished, "but i and my wife are intense relieved to be free of it 
all. only i must say i should like to know something of the former 
history of the house. when we took it six month ago i heard no word 
against it." 

dr. silence drew a typewritten paper from his pocket. 

"i can satisfy your curiosity to some extent," he said, running his eye 
over the sheets, and then replace them in his coat; "for by my 
secretary's investigate i have been able to check certain information 
obtain in the hypnotic trance by a 'sensitive' who help me in such 
cases. the former occupant who haunt you appear to have been a woman 
of singularly atrocious life and character who finally suffer death by 
hanging, after a series of crime that appall the whole of england and 
only came to light by the merest chance. she came to her end in the year 
1798, for it was not this particular house she live in, but a much 
large one that then stood upon the site it now occupies, and was then, 
of course, not in london, but in the country. she was a person of 
intellect, possessed of a powerful, train will, and of consummate 
audacity, and i am convinced avail herself of the resources of the 
lower magic to attain her ends. this go far to explain the virulence 
of the attack upon yourself, and why she is still able to carry on after 
death the evil practice that form her main purpose during life." 

"you think that after death a soul can still conscious direct--" 
gasp the author. 

"i think, as i told you before, that the forces of a powerful 
personality may still persist after death in the line of their original 
momentum," reply the doctor; "and that strong thought and purpose 
can still react upon suitable prepared brains long after their 
originate have pass away. 

"if you knew anything of magic," he pursued, "you would know that 
thought is dynamic, and that it may call into existence form and 
pictures that may well exist for hundred of years. for, not far remove 
from the region of our human life is another region where float the 
waste and drift of all the centuries, the limbo of the shell of the 
dead; a dense populate region cram with horror and abomination of 
all descriptions, and sometimes galvanise into active life again by the 
will of a train manipulator, a mind versed in the practice of lower 
magic. that this woman understood its vile commerce, i am persuaded, 
and the forces she set go during her life have simply been 
accumulate ever since, and would have continue to do so had they not 
been drawn down upon yourself, and afterwards discharge and satisfy 
through me. 

"anything might have brought down the attack, for, besides drugs, there 
are certain violent emotions, certain mood of the soul, certain 
spiritual fevers, if i may so call them, which directly open the inner 
being to a cognisance of this astral region i have mentioned. in your 
case it happen to be a peculiarly potent drug that did it. 

"but now, tell me," he added, after a pause, hand to the perplexed 
author a pencil drawing he had made of the dark countenance that had 
appear to him during the night on putney hill--"tell me if you 
recognise this face?" 

pender look at the drawing closely, greatly astonished. he shudder a 
little as he looked. 

"undoubtedly," he said, "it is the face i kept try to draw--dark, 
with the great mouth and jaw, and the droop eye. that is the woman." 

dr. silence then produce from his pocket-book an old-fashioned woodcut 
of the same person which his secretary had unearth from the record of 
the newgate calendar. the woodcut and the pencil drawing were two 
different aspect of the same dreadful visage. the men compare them for 
some moments in silence. 

"it make me thank god for the limitation of our senses," said pender 
quietly, with a sigh; "continuous clairvoyance must be a sore 
affliction." 

"it is indeed," return john silence significantly, "and if all the 
people nowadays who claim to be clairvoyant were really so, the 
statistics of suicide and lunacy would be considerably higher than they 
are. it is little wonder," he added, "that your sense of humour was 
clouded, with the mind-forces of that dead monster try to use your 
brain for their dissemination. you have had an interesting adventure, 
mr. felix pender, and, let me add, a fortunate escape." 

the author was about to renew his thanks when there came a sound of 
scratch at the door, and the doctor sprang up quickly. 

"it's time for me to go. i left my dog on the step, but i suppose--" 

before he had time to open the door, it had yield to the pressure 
behind it and flew wide open to admit a great yellow-haired collie. the 
dog, wag his tail and contort his whole body with delight, tore 
across the floor and try to leap up upon his owner's breast. and there 
was laughter and happiness in the old eyes; for they were clear again as 
the day. 




case ii: ancient sorcery 


i 

there are, it would appear, certain wholly unremarkable persons, with 
none of the characteristic that invite adventure, who yet once or twice 
in the course of their smooth lives undergo an experience so strange 
that the world catch its breath--and looks the other way! and it was 
case of this kind, perhaps, more than any other, that fell into the 
wide-spread net of john silence, the psychic doctor, and, appealing to 
his deep humanity, to his patience, and to his great quality of 
spiritual sympathy, led often to the revelation of problem of the 
strangest complexity, and of the profoundest possible human interest. 

matter that seem almost too curious and fantastic for belief he love 
to trace to their hidden sources. to unravel a tangle in the very soul 
of things--and to release a suffering human soul in the process--was 
with him a veritable passion. and the knot he untie were, indeed, 
after passing strange. 

the world, of course, ask for some plausible basis to which it can 
attach credence--something it can, at least, pretend to explain. the 
adventurous type it can understand: such people carry about with them an 
adequate explanation of their exciting lives, and their character 
obviously drive them into the circumstances which produce the 
adventures. it expect nothing else from them, and is satisfied. but 
dull, ordinary folk have no right to out-of-the-way experiences, and the 
world have been led to expect otherwise, is disappointed with them, 
not to say shocked. its complacent judgment has been rudely disturbed. 

"such a thing happen to _that_ man!" it cries--"a commonplace person 
like that! it is too absurd! there must be something wrong!" 

yet there could be no question that something did actually happen to 
little arthur vezin, something of the curious nature he describe to dr. 
silence. outwardly or inwardly, it happen beyond a doubt, and in spite 
of the jeer of his few friends who heard the tale, and observe wise 
that "such a thing might perhaps have come to iszard, that crack-brained 
iszard, or to that odd fish minski, but it could never have happen to 
commonplace little vezin, who was fore-ordained to live and die 
according to scale." 

but, whatever his method of death was, vezin certainly did not "live 
according to scale" so far as this particular event in his otherwise 
uneventful life was concerned; and to hear him recount it, and watch his 
pale delicate features change, and hear his voice grow soft and more 
hush as he proceeded, was to know the conviction that his halting 
words perhaps fail sometimes to convey. he live the thing over again 
each time he told it. his whole personality became muffle in the 
recital. it subdued him more than ever, so that the tale became a 
lengthy apology for an experience that he deprecated. he appear to 
excuse himself and ask your pardon for have dare to take part in so 
fantastic an episode. for little vezin was a timid, gentle, sensitive 
soul, rarely able to assert himself, tender to man and beast, and almost 
constitutionally unable to say no, or to claim many things that should 
rightly have been his. his whole scheme of life seem utterly remote 
from anything more exciting than missing a train or lose an umbrella 
on an omnibus. and when this curious event came upon him he was already 
more years beyond forty than his friends suspect or he care to admit. 

john silence, who heard him speak of his experience more than once, said 
that he sometimes left out certain detail and put in others; yet they 
were all obviously true. the whole scene was unforgettable 
cinematograph on to his mind. none of the detail were imagine or 
invented. and when he told the story with them all complete, the effect 
was undeniable. his appealing brown eyes shone, and much of the charming 
personality, usually so careful repressed, came forward and reveal 
itself. his modesty was always there, of course, but in the telling he 
forgot the present and allow himself to appear almost vivid as he 
live again in the past of his adventure. 

he was on the way home when it happened, crossing northern france from 
some mountain trip or other where he bury himself solitary-wise every 
summer. he had nothing but an unregistered bag in the rack, and the 
train was jam to suffocation, most of the passenger being unredeemed 
holiday english. he dislike them, not because they were his 
fellow-countrymen, but because they were noisy and obtrusive, 
obliterate with their big limb and tweed clothing all the quiet 
tint of the day that brought him satisfaction and enable him to melt 
into insignificance and forget that he was anybody. these english 
clash about him like a brass band, making him feel vague that he 
ought to be more self-assertive and obstreperous, and that he did not 
claim insistent enough all kind of things that he didn't want and 
that were really valueless, such as corner seats, window up or down, 
and so forth. 

so that he felt uncomfortable in the train, and wish the journey were 
over and he was back again living with his unmarried sister in surbiton. 

and when the train stop for ten pant minutes at the little station 
in northern france, and he got out to stretch his leg on the platform, 
and saw to his dismay a further batch of the britain isle debouch 
from another train, it sudden seem impossible to him to continue the 
journey. even _his_ flabby soul revolted, and the idea of stay a 
night in the little town and go on next day by a slower, empty 
train, flash into his mind. the guard was already shouting "_en 
voiture_" and the corridor of his compartment was already packed when 
the thought came to him. and, for once, he act with decision and 
rush to snatch his bag. 

finding the corridor and steps impassable, he tap at the window (for 
he had a corner seat) and beg the frenchman who sat opposite to hand 
his luggage out to him, explain in his wretched france that he 
intended to break the journey there. and this elderly frenchman, he 
declared, gave him a look, half of warning, half of reproach, that to 
his die day he could never forget; hand the bag through the window 
of the moving train; and at the same time pour into his ear a long 
sentence, spoken rapid and low, of which he was able to comprehend 
only the last few words: "_à cause du sommeil et à cause des chats_." 

in reply to dr. silence, whose singular psychic acute at once seize 
upon this frenchman as a vital point in the adventure, vezin admitted 
that the man had impress him favourable from the beginning, though 
without being able to explain why. they had sat facing one another 
during the four hour of the journey, and though no conversation had 
pass between them--vezin was timid about his stutter french--he 
confessed that his eyes were being continual drawn to his face, 
almost, he felt, to rudeness, and that each, by a dozen nameless little 
politenesse and attentions, had evince the desire to be kind. the men 
like each other and their personalities did not clash, or would not 
have clash had they chance to come to terms of acquaintance. the 
frenchman, indeed, seem to have exercise a silent protective 
influence over the insignificant little englishman, and without words or 
gesture betray that he wish him well and would gladly have been of 
service to him. 

"and this sentence that he hurl at you after the bag?" ask john 
silence, smile that peculiarly sympathetic smile that always melt 
the prejudice of his patient, "were you unable to follow it exactly?" 

"it was so quick and low and vehement," explain vezin, in his small 
voice, "that i miss practically the whole of it. i only caught the few 
words at the very end, because he spoke them so clearly, and his face 
was bent down out of the carriage window so near to mine." 

"'_À cause du sommeil et à cause des chats'?_" repeated dr. silence, as 
though half speak to himself. 

"that's it exactly," said vezin; "which, i take it, means something like 
'because of sleep and because of the cats,' doesn't it?" 

"certainly, that's how i should translate it," the doctor observe 
shortly, evidently not wish to interrupt more than necessary. 

"and the rest of the sentence--all the first part i couldn't understand, 
i mean--was a warning not to do something--not to stop in the town, or 
at some particular place in the town, perhaps. that was the impression 
it made on me." 

then, of course, the train rush off, and left vezin standing on the 
platform alone and rather forlorn. 

the little town climb in straggle fashion up a sharp hill rising out 
of the plain at the back of the station, and was crown by the twin 
tower of the ruin cathedral peep over the summit. from the station 
itself it look uninterest and modern, but the fact was that the 
mediaeval position lay out of sight just beyond the crest. and once he 
reach the top and enter the old streets, he step clean out of 
modern life into a bygone century. the noise and bustle of the crowded 
train seem days away. the spirit of this silent hill-town, remote from 
tourist and motor-cars, dream its own quiet life under the autumn 
sun, rose up and cast its spell upon him. long before he recognise this 
spell he act under it. he walk softly, almost on tiptoe, down the 
winding narrow street where the gable all but met over his head, and 
he enter the doorway of the solitary inn with a deprecate and modest 
demeanour that was in itself an apology for intrude upon the place and 
disturb its dream. 

at first, however, vezin said, he notice very little of all this. the 
attempt at analysis came much later. what struck him then was only the 
delightful contrast of the silence and peace after the dust and noisy 
rattle of the train. he felt soothe and stroke like a cat. 

"like a cat, you said?" interrupt john silence, quick catching him 
up. 

"yes. at the very start i felt that." he laugh apologetically. "i felt 
as though the warmth and the still and the comfort made me purr. it 
seem to be the general mood of the whole place--then." 

the inn, a rambling ancient house, the atmosphere of the old coach 
days still about it, apparently did not welcome him too warmly. he felt 
he was only tolerated, he said. but it was cheap and comfortable, and 
the delicious cup of afternoon tea he ordered at once made him feel 
really very pleased with himself for leave the train in this bold, 
original way. for to him it had seem bold and original. he felt 
something of a dog. his room, too, soothe him with its dark panelling 
and low irregular ceiling, and the long slope passage that led to it 
seem the natural pathway to a real chamber of sleep--a little dim 
cubby hole out of the world where noise could not enter. it look upon 
the courtyard at the back. it was all very charming, and made him think 
of himself as dress in very soft velvet somehow, and the floor seem 
padded, the wall provided with cushions. the sound of the street 
could not penetrate there. it was an atmosphere of absolute rest that 
surround him. 

on engaging the two-franc room he had interview the only person who 
seem to be about that sleepy afternoon, an elderly waiter with 
dundreary whiskers and a drowsy courtesy, who had amble lazy towards 
him across the stone yard; but on coming downstairs again for a little 
promenade in the town before dinner he encounter the proprietress 
herself. she was a large woman whose hands, feet, and features seem to 
swim towards him out of a sea of person. they emerged, so to speak. but 
she had great dark, vivacious eyes that counteract the bulk of her 
body, and betray the fact that in reality she was both vigorous and 
alert. when he first caught sight of her she was knitting in a low chair 
against the sunlight of the wall, and something at once made him see her 
as a great tabby cat, dozing, yet awake, heavy sleepy, and yet at the 
same time prepared for instantaneous action. a great mouser on the watch 
occur to him. 

she took him in with a single comprehensive glance that was polite 
without being cordial. her neck, he noticed, was extraordinarily supple 
in spite of its proportions, for it turn so easily to follow him, and 
the head it carry bowed so very flexibly. 

"but when she look at me, you know," said vezin, with that little 
apologetic smile in his brown eyes, and that faint deprecate gesture 
of the shoulder that was characteristic of him, "the odd notion came to 
me that really she had intended to make quite a different movement, and 
that with a single bound she could have leap at me across the width of 
that stone yard and pounce upon me like some huge cat upon a mouse." 

he laugh a little soft laugh, and dr. silence made a note in his book 
without interrupting, while vezin proceed in a tone as though he 
fear he had already told too much and more than we could believe. 

"very soft, yet very active she was, for all her size and mass, and i 
felt she knew what i was do even after i had pass and was behind 
her back. she spoke to me, and her voice was smooth and running. she 
ask if i had my luggage, and was comfortable in my room, and then 
add that dinner was at seven o'clock, and that they were very early 
people in this little country town. clearly, she intended to convey that 
late hour were not encouraged." 

evidently, she contrived by voice and manner to give him the impression 
that here he would be "managed," that everything would be arrange and 
plan for him, and that he had nothing to do but fall into the groove 
and obey. no decided action or sharp personal effort would be look for 
from him. it was the very reverse of the train. he walk quiet out 
into the street feeling soothe and peaceful. he realise that he was in 
a _milieu_ that suit him and stroke him the right way. it was so much 
easy to be obedient. he began to purr again, and to feel that all the 
town purr with him. 

about the street of that little town he meander gently, fall 
deep and deep into the spirit of repose that characterise it. with 
no special aim he wander up and down, and to and fro. the september 
sunshine fell slanting over the roofs. down winding alleyways, fringe 
with tumble gable and open casements, he caught fairylike glimpse of 
the great plain below, and of the meadow and yellow copse lie like a 
dream-map in the haze. the spell of the past held very potent here, he 
felt. 

the street were full of picturesque garb men and women, all busy 
enough, go their respective ways; but no one took any notice of him 
or turn to stare at his obviously english appearance. he was even able 
to forget that with his tourist appearance he was a false note in a 
charming picture, and he melt more and more into the scene, feeling 
delightful insignificant and unimportant and unselfconscious. it was 
like becoming part of a soft coloured dream which he did not even 
realise to be a dream. 

on the eastern side the hill fell away more sharply, and the plain below 
ran off rather sudden into a sea of gathering shadow in which the 
little patch of woodland look like island and the stubble field 
like deep water. here he stroll along the old rampart of ancient 
fortification that once had been formidable, but now were only 
vision-like with their charming mingle of broken grey wall and 
wayward vine and ivy. from the broad coping on which he sat for a 
moment, level with the round tops of clip plane trees, he saw the 
esplanade far below lie in shadow. here and there a yellow sunbeam 
crept in and lay upon the fallen yellow leaves, and from the height he 
look down and saw that the townsfolk were walking to and fro in the 
cool of the evening. he could just hear the sound of their slow 
footfalls, and the murmur of their voice float up to him through the 
gap between the trees. the figures look like shadow as he caught 
glimpse of their quiet movements far below. 

he sat there for some time pondering, bath in the wave of murmur and 
half-lost echo that rose to his ears, muffle by the leaves of the 
plane trees. the whole town, and the little hill out of which it grew as 
naturally as an ancient wood, seem to him like a being lie there 
half asleep on the plain and croon to itself as it dozed. 

and, presently, as he sat lazy melting into its dream, a sound of 
horn and strings and wood instrument rose to his ears, and the town 
band began to play at the far end of the crowded terrace below to the 
accompaniment of a very soft, deep-throated drum. vezin was very 
sensitive to music, knew about it intelligently, and had even ventured, 
unknown to his friends, upon the composition of quiet melody with 
low-running chord which he play to himself with the soft pedal when 
no one was about. and this music floating up through the tree from an 
invisible and doubtless very picturesque band of the townspeople wholly 
charm him. he recognise nothing that they played, and it sound as 
though they were simply improvise without a conductor. no definitely 
marked time ran through the pieces, which end and began oddly after 
the fashion of wind through an aeolian harp. it was part of the place 
and scene, just as the die sunlight and faint breathing wind were 
part of the scene and hour, and the mellow note of old-fashioned 
plaintive horns, pierce here and there by the sharper strings, all half 
smother by the continuous boom of the deep drum, touched his soul 
with a curious potent spell that was almost too engrossing to be quite 
pleasant. 

there was a certain queer sense of bewitch in it all. the music 
seem to him oddly unartificial. it made him think of tree swept by 
the wind, of night breeze singing among wire and chimney-stacks, or in 
the rigging of invisible ships; or--and the simile leap up in his 
thought with a sudden sharp of suggestion--a chorus of animals, of 
wild creatures, somewhere in desolate place of the world, crying and 
singing as animal will, to the moon. he could fancy he heard the 
wailing, half-human cries of cat upon the tile at night, rising and 
fall with weird interval of sound, and this music, muffle by 
distance and the trees, made him think of a queer company of these 
creature on some roof far away in the sky, utter their solemn music 
to one another and the moon in chorus. 

it was, he felt at the time, a singular image to occur to him, yet it 
express his sensation pictorial better than anything else. the 
instrument play such impossible odd intervals, and the crescendo and 
diminuendo were so very suggestive of cat-land on the tile at night, 
rising swiftly, drop without warning to deep note again, and all in 
such strange confusion of discord and accords. but, at the same time a 
plaintive sweet result on the whole, and the discord of these 
half-broken instrument were so singular that they did not distress his 
musical soul like fiddle out of tune. 

he listen a long time, wholly surrender himself as his character 
was, and then stroll homewards in the dusk as the air grew chilly. 

"there was nothing to alarm?" put in dr. silence briefly. 

"absolutely nothing," said vezin; "but you know it was all so 
fantastic and charming that my imagination was profound impressed. 
perhaps, too," he continued, gently explanatory, "it was this stirring 
of my imagination that cause other impressions; for, as i walk back, 
the spell of the place began to steal over me in a dozen ways, though 
all intelligible ways. but there were other things i could not account 
for in the least, even then." 

"incidents, you mean?" 

"hardly incidents, i think. a lot of vivid sensation crowded themselves 
upon my mind and i could trace them to no causes. it was just after 
sunset and the tumble old building trace magical outline against an 
opalescent sky of gold and red. the dusk was running down the twist 
streets. all round the hill the plain pressed in like a dim sea, its 
level rising with the darkness. the spell of this kind of scene, you 
know, can be very moving, and it was so that night. yet i felt that what 
came to me had nothing directly to do with the mystery and wonder of the 
scene." 

"not merely the subtle transformation of the spirit that come with 
beauty," put in the doctor, notice his hesitation. 

"exactly," vezin went on, duly encourage and no long so fearful of 
our smile at his expense. "the impression came from somewhere else. 
for instance, down the busy main street where men and women were 
bustle home from work, shop at stalls and barrows, idle gossip 
in groups, and all the rest of it, i saw that i arouse no interest and 
that no one turn to stare at me as a foreigner and stranger. i was 
utterly ignored, and my presence among them excited no special interest 
or attention. 

"and then, quite suddenly, it dawn upon me with conviction that all 
the time this indifference and inattention were merely feigned. 
everybody as a matter of fact was watch me closely. every movement i 
made was known and observed. ignore me was all a pretence--an 
elaborate pretence." 

he pause a moment and look at us to see if we were smiling, and then 
continued, reassured-- 

"it is useless to ask me how i notice this, because i simply cannot 
explain it. but the discovery gave me something of a shock. before i got 
back to the inn, however, another curious thing rose up strong in my 
mind and forced my recognition of it as true. and this, too, i may as 
well say at once, was equally inexplicable to me. i mean i can only give 
you the fact, as fact it was to me." 

the little man left his chair and stood on the mat before the fire. his 
diffidence lessen from now onwards, as he lost himself again in the 
magic of the old adventure. his eyes shone a little already as he 
talked. 

"well," he went on, his soft voice rising somewhat with his excitement, 
"i was in a shop when it came to me first--though the idea must have 
been at work for a long time subconscious to appear in so complete a 
form all at once. i was buy socks, i think," he laughed, "and 
struggle with my dreadful french, when it struck me that the woman in 
the shop did not care two pin whether i bought anything or not. she was 
indifferent whether she made a sale or did not make a sale. she was only 
pretend to sell. 

"this sound a very small and fanciful incident to build upon what 
follows. but really it was not small. i mean it was the spark that lit 
the line of powder and ran along to the big blaze in my mind. 

"for the whole town, i sudden realised, was something other than i so 
far saw it. the real activity and interests of the people were 
elsewhere and otherwise than appeared. their true lives lay somewhere 
out of sight behind the scenes. their busy-ness was but the outward 
semblance that masked their actual purposes. they bought and sold, and 
ate and drank, and walk about the streets, yet all the while the main 
stream of their existence lay somewhere beyond my ken, underground, in 
secret places. in the shop and at the stalls they did not care whether 
i purchase their articles or not; at the inn, they were indifferent to 
my stay or going; their life lay remote from my own, spring from 
hidden, mysterious sources, coursing out of sight, unknown. it was all a 
great elaborate pretence, assume possibly for my benefit, or possibly 
for purpose of their own. but the main current of their energy ran 
elsewhere. i almost felt as an unwelcome foreign substance might be 
expect to feel when it has found its way into the human system and the 
whole body organise itself to eject it or to absorb it. the town was 
do this very thing to me. 

"this bizarre notion present itself forcibly to my mind as i walk 
home to the inn, and i began busy to wonder wherein the true life of 
this town could lie and what were the actual interests and activity of 
its hidden life. 

"and, now that my eyes were partly opened, i notice other things too 
that puzzle me, first of which, i think, was the extraordinary silence 
of the whole place. positively, the town was muffled. although the 
street were paved with cobble the people move about silently, softly, 
with pad feet, like cats. nothing made noise. all was hushed, 
subdued, muted. the very voice were quiet, low-pitched like purring. 
nothing clamorous, vehement or emphatic seem able to live in the 
drowsy atmosphere of soft dream that soothe this little hill-town 
into its sleep. it was like the woman at the inn--an outward repose 
screening intense inner activity and purpose. 

"yet there was no sign of lethargy or sluggish anywhere about it. 
the people were active and alert. only a magical and uncanny soft 
lay over them all like a spell." 

vezin pass his hand across his eyes for a moment as though the memory 
had become very vivid. his voice had run off into a whisper so that we 
heard the last part with difficulty. he was telling a true thing 
obviously, yet something that he both like and hate telling. 

"i went back to the inn," he continue presently in a loud voice, "and 
dined. i felt a new strange world about me. my old world of reality 
receded. here, whether i like it or no, was something new and 
incomprehensible. i regret have left the train so impulsively. an 
adventure was upon me, and i loathe adventure as foreign to my nature. 
moreover, this was the beginning apparently of an adventure somewhere 
deep within me, in a region i could not check or measure, and a feeling 
of alarm mingle itself with my wonder--alarm for the stability of what 
i had for forty years recognise as my 'personality.' 

"i went upstairs to bed, my mind teeming with thought that were unusual 
to me, and of rather a haunting description. by way of relief i kept 
thinking of that nice, prosaic noisy train and all those wholesome, 
bluster passengers. i almost wish i were with them again. but my 
dream took me elsewhere. i dream of cats, and soft-moving creatures, 
and the silence of life in a dim muffle world beyond the senses." 


ii 

vezin stay on from day to day, indefinitely, much long than he had 
intended. he felt in a kind of dazed, somnolent condition. he did 
nothing in particular, but the place fascinate him and he could not 
decide to leave. decision were always very difficult for him and he 
sometimes wonder how he had ever brought himself to the point of 
leave the train. it seem as though some one else must have arrange 
it for him, and once or twice his thought ran to the swarthy frenchman 
who had sat opposite. if only he could have understood that long 
sentence ending so strange with "_à cause du sommeil et à cause des 
chats_." he wonder what it all meant. 

meanwhile the hush soft of the town held him prisoner and he 
sought in his muddling, gentle way to find out where the mystery lay, 
and what it was all about. but his limited france and his constitutional 
hatred of active investigate made it hard for him to buttonhole 
anybody and ask questions. he was content to observe, and watch, and 
remain negative. 

the weather held on calm and hazy, and this just suit him. he wander 
about the town till he knew every street and alley. the people suffer 
him to come and go without let or hindrance, though it became clear to 
him every day that he was never free himself from observation. the town 
watch him as a cat watches a mouse. and he got no near to finding 
out what they were all so busy with or where the main stream of their 
activity lay. this remain hidden. the people were as soft and 
mysterious as cats. 

but that he was continual under observation became more evident from 
day to day. 

for instance, when he stroll to the end of the town and enter a 
little green public garden beneath the rampart and seat himself upon 
one of the empty bench in the sun, he was quite alone--at first. not 
another seat was occupied; the little park was empty, the path 
deserted. yet, within ten minutes of his coming, there must have been 
fully twenty person scattered about him, some strolling aimless along 
the gravel walks, staring at the flowers, and other seat on the 
wooden bench enjoy the sun like himself. none of them appear to 
take any notice of him; yet he understood quite well they had all come 
there to watch. they kept him under close observation. in the street 
they had seem busy enough, hurry upon various errands; yet these 
were sudden all forgotten and they had nothing to do but loll and laze 
in the sun, their duty unremembered. five minutes after he left, the 
garden was again deserted, the seat vacant. but in the crowded street 
it was the same thing again; he was never alone. he was ever in their 
thoughts. 

by degrees, too, he began to see how it was he was so clever watched, 
yet without the appearance of it. the people did nothing _directly_. 
they behave _obliquely_. he laugh in his mind as the thought thus 
clothe itself in words, but the phrase exactly describe it. they 
look at him from angle which naturally should have led their sight in 
another direction altogether. their movements were oblique, too, so far 
as these concerned himself. the straight, direct thing was not their way 
evidently. they did nothing obviously. if he enter a shop to buy, the 
woman walk instantly away and busy herself with something at the 
farther end of the counter, though answer at once when he spoke, 
showing that she knew he was there and that this was only her way of 
attend to him. it was the fashion of the cat she followed. even in 
the dining-room of the inn, the be-whiskered and courteous waiter, lithe 
and silent in all his movements, never seem able to come straight to 
his table for an order or a dish. he came by zigzags, indirectly, 
vaguely, so that he appear to be go to another table altogether, 
and only turn sudden at the last moment, and was there beside him. 

vezin smile curious to himself as he describe how he began to 
realize these things. other tourist there were none in the hostel, but 
he recall the figures of one or two old men, inhabitants, who took 
their _déjeuner_ and dinner there, and remember how fantastic they 
enter the room in similar fashion. first, they pause in the doorway, 
peer about the room, and then, after a temporary inspection, they 
came in, as it were, sideways, keeping close to the wall so that he 
wonder which table they were making for, and at the last minute making 
almost a little quick run to their particular seats. and again he 
thought of the ways and method of cats. 

other small incidents, too, impress him as all part of this queer, 
soft town with its muffled, indirect life, for the way some of the 
people appear and disappear with extraordinary swift puzzle him 
exceedingly. it may have been all perfectly natural, he knew, yet he 
could not make it out how the alley swallow them up and shot them 
forth in a second of time when there were no visible doorway or 
opening near enough to explain the phenomenon. once he follow two 
elderly women who, he felt, had been particularly examine him from 
across the street--quite near the inn this was--and saw them turn the 
corner a few feet only in front of him. yet when he sharp follow on 
their heel he saw nothing but an utterly desert alley stretch in 
front of him with no sign of a living thing. and the only opening 
through which they could have escape was a porch some fifty yard away, 
which not the swiftest human runner could have reach in time. 

and in just such sudden fashion people appeared, when he never expect 
them. once when he heard a great noise of fight go on behind a low 
wall, and hurried up to see what was go on, what should he see but a 
group of girl and women engaged in vociferous conversation which 
instantly hush itself to the normal whisper note of the town when 
his head appear over the wall. and even then none of them turn to 
look at him directly, but slunk off with the most unaccountable 
rapid into door and shed across the yard. and their voices, he 
thought, had sound so like, so strange like, the angry snarl of 
fight animals, almost of cats. 

the whole spirit of the town, however, continue to evade him as 
something elusive, protean, screen from the outer world, and at the 
same time intensely, genuine vital; and, since he now form part of 
its life, this concealment puzzle and irritate him; more--it began 
rather to frighten him. 

out of the mists that slow gather about his ordinary surface 
thoughts, there rose again the idea that the inhabitant were wait 
for him to declare himself, to take an attitude, to do this, or to do 
that; and that when he had done so they in their turn would at length 
make some direct response, accept or reject him. yet the vital 
matter concerning which his decision was await came no near to him. 

once or twice he purposely follow little procession or group of the 
citizen in order to find out, if possible, on what purpose they were 
bent; but they always discover him in time and dwindle away, each 
individual go his or her own way. it was always the same: he never 
could learn what their main interest was. the cathedral was ever empty, 
the old church of st. martin, at the other end of the town, deserted. 
they shop because they had to, and not because they wish to. the 
booth stood neglected, the stalls unvisited, the little _cafés_ 
desolate. yet the street were always full, the townsfolk ever on the 
bustle. 

"can it be," he thought to himself, yet with a deprecate laugh that he 
should have dare to think anything so odd, "can it be that these people 
are people of the twilight, that they live only at night their real 
life, and come out honestly only with the dusk? that during the day they 
make a sham though brave pretence, and after the sun is down their true 
life begins? have they the soul of night-things, and is the whole 
blessed town in the hand of the cats?" 

the fancy somehow electrify him with little shock of shrink and 
dismay. yet, though he affected to laugh, he knew that he was beginning 
to feel more than uneasy, and that strange forces were tug with a 
thousand invisible cords at the very centre of his being. something 
utterly remote from his ordinary life, something that had not wake for 
years, began faint to stir in his soul, send feeler abroad into 
his brain and heart, shape queer thought and penetrating even into 
certain of his minor actions. something exceedingly vital to himself, to 
his soul, hung in the balance. 

and, always when he return to the inn about the hour of sunset, he saw 
the figures of the townsfolk steal through the dusk from their shop 
doors, moving sentry-wise to and fro at the corner of the streets, yet 
always vanish silent like shadow at his near approach. and as the 
inn invariable closed its door at ten o'clock he had never yet found 
the opportunity he rather half-heartedly sought to see for himself what 
account the town could give of itself at night. 

"--_à cause du sommeil et à cause des chats_"--the words now rang in his 
ear more and more often, though still as yet without any definite 
meaning. 

moreover, something made him sleep like the dead. 


iii 

it was, i think, on the fifth day--though in this detail his story 
sometimes varied--that he made a definite discovery which increase his 
alarm and brought him up to a rather sharp climax. before that he had 
already notice that a change was go forward and certain subtle 
transformation being brought about in his character which modify 
several of his minor habits. and he had affected to ignore them. here, 
however, was something he could no long ignore; and it startle him. 

at the best of times he was never very positive, always negative rather, 
compliant and acquiescent; yet, when necessity arose he was capable of 
reasonably vigorous action and could take a strongish decision. the 
discovery he now made that brought him up with such a sharp turn was 
that this power had positively dwindle to nothing. he found it 
impossible to make up his mind. for, on this fifth day, he realise that 
he had stay long enough in the town and that for reason he could only 
vague define to himself it was wise _and safer_ that he should leave. 

and he found that he could not leave! 

this is difficult to describe in words, and it was more by gesture and 
the expression of his face that he convey to dr. silence the state of 
impotence he had reached. all this spy and watching, he said, had as 
it were spun a net about his feet so that he was trap and powerless 
to escape; he felt like a fly that had blunder into the intricacy of 
a great web; he was caught, imprisoned, and could not get away. it was a 
distressing sensation. a numb had crept over his will till it had 
become almost incapable of decision. the mere thought of vigorous 
action--action towards escape--began to terrify him. all the current of 
his life had turn inwards upon himself, strive to bring to the 
surface something that lay bury almost beyond reach, determined to 
force his recognition of something he had long forgotten--forgotten 
years upon years, century almost ago. it seem as though a window 
deep within his being would presently open and reveal an entire new 
world, yet somehow a world that was not unfamiliar. beyond that, again, 
he fancy a great curtain hung; and when that too roll up he would 
see still farther into this region and at last understand something of 
the secret life of these extraordinary people. 

"is this why they wait and watch?" he ask himself with rather a 
shake heart, "for the time when i shall join them--or refuse to join 
them? do the decision rest with me after all, and not with them?" 

and it was at this point that the sinister character of the adventure 
first really declared itself, and he became genuine alarmed. the 
stability of his rather fluid little personality was at stake, he felt, 
and something in his heart turn coward. 

why otherwise should he have sudden taken to walking stealthily, 
silently, making as little sound as possible, for ever look behind 
him? why else should he have move almost on tiptoe about the passage 
of the practically desert inn, and when he was abroad have found 
himself deliberate taking advantage of what cover present itself? 
and why, if he was not afraid, should the wisdom of stay indoors 
after sundown have sudden occur to him as eminently desirable? why, 
indeed? 

and, when john silence gently pressed him for an explanation of these 
things, he admitted apologetic that he had none to give. 

"it was simply that i fear something might happen to me unless i kept 
a sharp look-out. i felt afraid. it was instinctive," was all he could 
say. "i got the impression that the whole town was after me--wanted me 
for something; and that if it got me i should lose myself, or at least 
the self i knew, in some unfamiliar state of consciousness. but i am not 
a psychologist, you know," he add meekly, "and i cannot define it 
better than that." 

it was while lounge in the courtyard half an hour before the evening 
meal that vezin made this discovery, and he at once went upstairs to his 
quiet room at the end of the winding passage to think it over alone. in 
the yard it was empty enough, true, but there was always the possibility 
that the big woman whom he dread would come out of some door, with her 
pretence of knitting, to sit and watch him. this had happen several 
times, and he could not endure the sight of her. he still remember his 
original fancy, bizarre though it was, that she would spring upon him 
the moment his back was turn and land with one single crush leap 
upon his neck. of course it was nonsense, but then it haunt him, and 
once an idea begin to do that it cease to be nonsense. it has clothe 
itself in reality. 

he went upstairs accordingly. it was dusk, and the oil lamp had not 
yet been lit in the passages. he stumble over the uneven surface of 
the ancient flooring, passing the dim outline of door along the 
corridor--doors that he had never once seen opened--rooms that seem 
never occupied. he moved, as his habit now was, stealthy and on 
tiptoe. 

half-way down the last passage to his own chamber there was a sharp 
turn, and it was just here, while grope round the wall with 
outstretched hands, that his finger touched something that was not 
wall--something that moved. it was soft and warm in texture, 
indescribable fragrant, and about the height of his shoulder; and he 
immediately thought of a furry, sweet-smelling kitten. the next minute 
he knew it was something quite different. 

instead of investigating, however,--his nerves must have been too 
overwrought for that, he said,--he shrank back as close as possible 
against the wall on the other side. the thing, whatever it was, slip 
past him with a sound of rustling and, retreat with light footstep 
down the passage behind him, was gone. a breath of warm, scent air was 
waft to his nostrils. 

vezin caught his breath for an instant and paused, stockstill, half 
leaning against the wall--and then almost ran down the remain 
distance and enter his room with a rush, lock the door hurried 
behind him. yet it was not fear that made him run: it was excitement, 
pleasurable excitement. his nerves were tingling, and a delicious glow 
made itself felt all over his body. in a flash it came to him that this 
was just what he had felt twenty-five years ago as a boy when he was in 
love for the first time. warm current of life ran all over him and 
mount to his brain in a whirl of soft delight. his mood was sudden 
become tender, melting, loving. 

the room was quite dark, and he collapse upon the sofa by the window, 
wonder what had happen to him and what it all meant. but the only 
thing he understood clearly in that instant was that something in him 
had swiftly, magical changed: he no long wish to leave, or to 
argue with himself about leaving. the encounter in the passage-way had 
change all that. the strange perfume of it still hung about him, 
bemuse his heart and mind. for he knew that it was a girl who had 
pass him, a girl's face that his finger had brush in the darkness, 
and he felt in some extraordinary way as though he had been actually 
kiss by her, kiss full upon the lips. 

trembling, he sat upon the sofa by the window and struggle to collect 
his thoughts. he was utterly unable to understand how the mere passing 
of a girl in the dark of a narrow passage-way could communicate so 
electric a thrill to his whole being that he still shook with the 
sweet of it. yet, there it was! and he found it as useless to deny 
as to attempt analysis. some ancient fire had enter his veins, and 
now ran coursing through his blood; and that he was forty-five instead 
of twenty did not matter one little jot. out of all the inner turmoil 
and confusion emerge the one salient fact that the mere atmosphere, the 
merest casual touch, of this girl, unseen, unknown in the darkness, had 
been sufficient to stir dormant fire in the centre of his heart, and 
rouse his whole being from a state of feeble sluggish to one of 
tear and tumultuous excitement. 

after a time, however, the number of vezin's years began to assert their 
cumulative power; he grew calmer, and when a knock came at length upon 
his door and he heard the waiter's voice suggest that dinner was 
nearly over, he pull himself together and slow made his way 
downstairs into the dining-room. 

every one look up as he entered, for he was very late, but he took his 
customary seat in the far corner and began to eat. the trepidation was 
still in his nerves, but the fact that he had pass through the 
courtyard and hall without catching sight of a petticoat serve to calm 
him a little. he ate so fast that he had almost caught up with the 
current stage of the table d'hôte, when a slight commotion in the room 
drew his attention. 

his chair was so placed that the door and the greater portion of the 
long _salle à manger_ were behind him, yet it was not necessary to turn 
round to know that the same person he had pass in the dark passage had 
now come into the room. he felt the presence long before he heard or saw 
any one. then he became aware that the old men, the only other guests, 
were rising one by one in their places, and exchange greeting with 
some one who pass among them from table to table. and when at length 
he turn with his heart beating furiously to ascertain for himself, he 
saw the form of a young girl, lithe and slim, moving down the centre of 
the room and making straight for his own table in the corner. she move 
wonderfully, with sinuous grace, like a young panther, and her approach 
fill him with such delicious bewilder that he was utterly unable 
to tell at first what her face was like, or discover what it was about 
the whole present of the creature that fill him anew with 
trepidation and delight. 

"ah, ma'mselle est de retour!" he heard the old waiter murmur at his 
side, and he was just able to take in that she was the daughter of the 
proprietress, when she was upon him, and he heard her voice. she was 
address him. something of red lip he saw and laugh white teeth, 
and stray wisp of fine dark hair about the temples; but all the rest 
was a dream in which his own emotion rose like a thick cloud before his 
eyes and prevent his seeing accurately, or knowing exactly what he 
did. he was aware that she greet him with a charming little bow; that 
her beautiful large eyes look searching into his own; that the 
perfume he had notice in the dark passage again assail his nostrils, 
and that she was bend a little towards him and leaning with one hand 
on the table at this side. she was quite close to him--that was the 
chief thing he knew--explaining that she had been ask after the 
comfort of her mother's guests, and now was introduce herself to the 
latest arrival--himself. 

"m'sieur has already been here a few days," he heard the waiter say; and 
then her own voice, sweet as singing, replied-- 

"ah, but m'sieur is not go to leave us just yet, i hope. my mother is 
too old to look after the comfort of our guest properly, but now i am 
here i will remedy all that." she laugh deliciously. "m'sieur shall be 
well look after." 

vezin, struggle with his emotion and desire to be polite, half rose to 
acknowledge the pretty speech, and to stammer some sort of reply, but as 
he did so his hand by chance touched her own that was rest upon the 
table, and a shock that was for all the world like a shock of 
electricity, pass from her skin into his body. his soul waver and 
shook deep within him. he caught her eyes fixed upon his own with a look 
of most curious intentness, and the next moment he knew that he had sat 
down wordless again on his chair, that the girl was already half-way 
across the room, and that he was try to eat his salad with a 
dessert-spoon and a knife. 

longing for her return, and yet dread it, he gulp down the 
remainder of his dinner, and then went at once to his bedroom to be 
alone with his thoughts. this time the passage were lighted, and he 
suffer no exciting contretemps; yet the winding corridor was dim with 
shadows, and the last portion, from the bend of the wall onwards, 
seem long than he had ever known it. it ran downhill like the 
pathway on a mountain side, and as he tiptoe soft down it he felt 
that by rights it ought to have led him clean out of the house into the 
heart of a great forest. the world was singing with him. strange fancies 
fill his brain, and once in the room, with the door secure locked, 
he did not light the candles, but sat by the open window thinking long, 
long thought that came unbidden in troops to his mind. 


iv 

this part of the story he told to dr. silence, without special coaxing, 
it is true, yet with much stammer embarrassment. he could not in the 
least understand, he said, how the girl had manage to affect him so 
profoundly, and even before he had set eyes upon her. for her mere 
proximity in the dark had been sufficient to set him on fire. he 
knew nothing of enchantments, and for years had been a stranger to 
anything approach tender relations with any member of the opposite 
sex, for he was encase in shyness, and realise his overwhelming 
defect only too well. yet this bewitch young creature came to him 
deliberately. her manner was unmistakable, and she sought him out on 
every possible occasion. chaste and sweet she was undoubtedly, yet 
frankly inviting; and she won him utterly with the first glance of her 
shining eyes, even if she had not already done so in the dark merely by 
the magic of her invisible presence. 

"you felt she was altogether wholesome and good!" query the doctor. 
"you had no reaction of any sort--for instance, of alarm?" 

vezin look up sharp with one of his inimitable little apologetic 
smiles. it was some time before he replied. the mere memory of the 
adventure had suffuse his shy face with blushes, and his brown eyes 
sought the floor again before he answered. 

"i don't think i can quite say that," he explain presently. "i 
acknowledge certain qualms, sitting up in my room afterwards. a 
conviction grew upon me that there was something about her--how shall i 
express it?--well, something unholy. it is not impurity in any sense, 
physical or mental, that i mean, but something quite indefinable that 
gave me a vague sensation of the creeps. she drew me, and at the same 
time repel me, more than--than--" 

he hesitated, blush furiously, and unable to finish the sentence. 

"nothing like it has ever come to me before or since," he concluded, 
with lame confusion. "i suppose it was, as you suggest just now, 
something of an enchantment. at any rate, it was strong enough to make 
me feel that i would stay in that awful little haunt town for years if 
only i could see her every day, hear her voice, watch her wonderful 
movements, and sometimes, perhaps, touch her hand." 

"can you explain to me what you felt was the source of her power?" john 
silence asked, look purposely anywhere but at the narrator. 

"i am surprise that you should ask me such a question," answer vezin, 
with the nearest approach to dignity he could manage. "i think no man 
can describe to another convincing wherein lie the magic of the woman 
who ensnare him. i certainly cannot. i can only say this slip of a girl 
bewitch me, and the mere knowledge that she was living and sleep in 
the same house fill me with an extraordinary sense of delight. 

"but there's one thing i can tell you," he went on earnestly, his eyes 
aglow, "namely, that she seem to sum up and synthesise in herself all 
the strange hidden forces that operate so mysterious in the town and 
its inhabitants. she had the silken movements of the panther, go 
smoothly, silent to and fro, and the same indirect, oblique method as 
the townsfolk, screening, like them, secret purpose of her 
own--purposes that i was sure had _me_ for their objective. she kept me, 
to my terror and delight, ceaseless under observation, yet so 
carelessly, so consummately, that another man less sensitive, if i may 
say so"--he made a deprecate gesture--"or less prepared by what had 
gone before, would never have notice it at all. she was always still, 
always reposeful, yet she seem to be everywhere at once, so that i 
never could escape from her. i was continual meeting the stare and 
laughter of her great eyes, in the corner of the rooms, in the 
passages, calm look at me through the windows, or in the busiest 
parts of the public streets." 

their intimacy, it seems, grew very rapid after this first encounter 
which had so violent disturbed the little man's equilibrium. he was 
naturally very prim, and prim folk live mostly in so small a world that 
anything violent unusual may shake them clean out of it, and they 
therefore instinctive distrust originality. but vezin began to forget 
his prim after awhile. the girl was always modest behaved, and as 
her mother's representative she naturally had to do with the guest in 
the hotel. it was not out of the way that a spirit of camaraderie should 
spring up. besides, she was young, she was charming pretty, she was 
french, and--she obviously like him. 

at the same time, there was something indescribable--a certain 
indefinable atmosphere of other places, other times--that made him try 
hard to remain on his guard, and sometimes made him catch his breath 
with a sudden start. it was all rather like a delirious dream, half 
delight, half dread, he confide in a whisper to dr. silence; and more 
than once he hardly knew quite what he was do or saying, as though he 
were driven forward by impulse he scarcely recognise as his own. 

and though the thought of leave present itself again and again to 
his mind, it was each time with less insistence, so that he stay on 
from day to day, becoming more and more a part of the sleepy life of 
this dreamy mediaeval town, lose more and more of his recognise 
personality. soon, he felt, the curtain within would roll up with an 
awful rush, and he would find himself sudden admitted into the secret 
purpose of the hidden life that lay behind it all. only, by that time, 
he would have become transform into an entire different being. 

and, meanwhile, he notice various little sign of the intention to 
make his stay attractive to him: flower in his bedroom, a more 
comfortable arm-chair in the corner, and even special little extra 
dishes on his private table in the dining-room. conversations, too, with 
"mademoiselle ilsé" became more and more frequent and pleasant, and 
although they seldom travelled beyond the weather, or the detail of the 
town, the girl, he noticed, was never in a hurry to bring them to an 
end, and often contrived to interject little odd sentence that he never 
properly understood, yet felt to be significant. 

and it was these stray remarks, full of a meaning that evade him, that 
pointed to some hidden purpose of her own and made him feel uneasy. they 
all had to do, he felt sure, with reason for his stay on in the town 
indefinitely. 

"and has m'sieur not even yet come to a decision?" she said soft in 
his ear, sitting beside him in the sunny yard before _déjeuner_, the 
acquaintance have progress with significant rapidity. "because, if 
it's so difficult, we must all try together to help him!" 

the question startle him, following upon his own thoughts. it was 
spoken with a pretty laugh, and a stray bit of hair across one eye, as 
she turn and peer at him half roguishly. possibly he did not quite 
understand the france of it, for her near presence always confuse his 
small knowledge of the language distressingly. yet the words, and her 
manner, and something else that lay behind it all in her mind, 
frightened him. it gave such point to his feeling that the town was 
wait for him to make his mind up on some important matter. 

at the same time, her voice, and the fact that she was there so close 
beside him in her soft dark dress, thrill him inexpressibly. 

"it is true i find it difficult to leave," he stammered, lose his way 
delicious in the depths of her eyes, "and especially now that 
mademoiselle ilsé has come." 

he was surprise at the success of his sentence, and quite delight 
with the little gallantry of it. but at the same time he could have 
bitten his tongue off for have said it. 

"then after all you like our little town, or you would not be pleased to 
stay on," she said, ignore the compliment. 

"i am enchant with it, and enchant with you," he cried, feeling that 
his tongue was somehow slip beyond the control of his brain. and he 
was on the verge of saying all manner of other things of the wildest 
description, when the girl sprang lightly up from her chair beside him, 
and made to go. 

"it is _soupe à l'onion_ to-day!" she cried, laugh back at him 
through the sunlight, "and i must go and see about it. otherwise, you 
know, m'sieur will not enjoy his dinner, and then, perhaps, he will 
leave us!" 

he watch her cross the courtyard, moving with all the grace and 
lightness of the feline race, and her simple black dress clothe her, he 
thought, exactly like the fur of the same supple species. she turn 
once to laugh at him from the porch with the glass door, and then 
stop a moment to speak to her mother, who sat knitting as usual in 
her corner seat just inside the hall-way. 

but how was it, then, that the moment his eye fell upon this ungainly 
woman, the pair of them appear sudden as other than they were? 
whence came that transform dignity and sense of power that envelop 
them both as by magic? what was it about that massive woman that made 
her appear instantly regal, and set her on a throne in some dark and 
dreadful scenery, wield a sceptre over the red glare of some 
tempestuous orgy? and why did this slender stripling of a girl, graceful 
as a willow, lithe as a young leopard, assume sudden an air of 
sinister majesty, and move with flame and smoke about her head, and the 
dark of night beneath her feet? 

vezin caught his breath and sat there transfixed. then, almost 
simultaneous with its appearance, the queer notion vanish again, and 
the sunlight of day caught them both, and he heard her laugh to her 
mother about the _soupe à l'onion_, and saw her glancing back at him 
over her dear little shoulder with a smile that made him think of a 
dew-kissed rose bend lightly before summer airs. 

and, indeed, the onion soup was particularly excellent that day, because 
he saw another cover laid at his small table, and, with flutter 
heart, heard the waiter murmur by way of explanation that "ma'mselle 
ilsé would honour m'sieur to-day at _déjeuner_, as her custom sometimes 
is with her mother's guests." 

so actually she sat by him all through that delirious meal, talk 
quiet to him in easy french, seeing that he was well look after, 
mix the salad-dressing, and even helping him with her own hand. and, 
later in the afternoon, while he was smoking in the courtyard, longing 
for a sight of her as soon as her duty were done, she came again to 
his side, and when he rose to meet her, she stood facing him a moment, 
full of a perplex sweet shy before she spoke-- 

"my mother think you ought to know more of the beauty of our little 
town, and _i_ think so too! would m'sieur like me to be his guide, 
perhaps? i can show him everything, for our family has live here for 
many generations." 

she had him by the hand, indeed, before he could find a single word to 
express his pleasure, and led him, all unresisting, out into the street, 
yet in such a way that it seem perfectly natural she should do so, and 
without the faintest suggestion of bold or immodesty. her face 
glow with the pleasure and interest of it, and with her short dress 
and tumble hair she look every bit the charming child of seventeen 
that she was, innocent and playful, proud of her native town, and alive 
beyond her years to the sense of its ancient beauty. 

so they went over the town together, and she show him what she 
considered its chief interest: the tumble-down old house where her 
forebear had lived; the sombre, aristocratic-looking mansion where her 
mother's family dwelt for centuries, and the ancient market-place where 
several hundred years before the witch had been burnt by the score. 
she kept up a lively running stream of talk about it all, of which he 
understood not a fiftieth part as he trudge along by her side, curse 
his forty-five years and feeling all the yearning of his early manhood 
revive and jeer at him. and, as she talked, england and surbiton seem 
very far away indeed, almost in another age of the world's history. her 
voice touched something immeasurable old in him, something that slept 
deep. it lull the surface parts of his consciousness to sleep, 
allow what was far more ancient to awaken. like the town, with its 
elaborate pretence of modern active life, the upper layer of his being 
became dulled, soothed, muffled, and what lay underneath began to stir 
in its sleep. that big curtain sway a little to and fro. presently it 
might lift altogether.... 

he began to understand a little better at last. the mood of the town was 
reproduce itself in him. in proportion as his ordinary external self 
became muffled, that inner secret life, that was far more real and 
vital, assert itself. and this girl was surely the high-priestess of 
it all, the chief instrument of its accomplishment. new thoughts, with 
new interpretations, flood his mind as she walk beside him through 
the winding streets, while the picturesque old gabled town, soft 
coloured in the sunset, had never appear to him so wholly wonderful 
and seductive. 

and only one curious incident came to disturb and puzzle him, slight in 
itself, but utterly inexplicable, bring white terror into the child's 
face and a scream to her laugh lips. he had merely pointed to a 
column of blue smoke that rose from the burning autumn leaves and made a 
picture against the red roofs, and had then run to the wall and call 
her to his side to watch the flame shoot here and there through the 
heap of rubbish. yet, at the sight of it, as though taken by surprise, 
her face had alter dreadfully, and she had turn and run like the 
wind, calling out wild sentence to him as she ran, of which he had not 
understood a single word, except that the fire apparently frightened 
her, and she want to get quick away from it, and to get him away 
too. 

yet five minutes later she was as calm and happy again as though 
nothing had happen to alarm or waken trouble thought in her, and 
they had both forgotten the incident. 

they were leaning over the ruin rampart together listen to the 
weird music of the band as he had heard it the first day of his arrival. 
it move him again profound as it had done before, and somehow he 
manage to find his tongue and his best french. the girl lean across 
the stone close beside him. no one was about. driven by some 
remorseless engine within he began to stammer something--he hardly knew 
what--of his strange admiration for her. almost at the first word she 
sprang lightly off the wall and came up smile in front of him, just 
touching his knee as he sat there. she was hatless as usual, and the 
sun caught her hair and one side of her cheek and throat. 

"oh, i'm so glad!" she cried, clap her little hand soft in his 
face, "so very glad, because that means that if you like me you must 
also like what i do, and what i belong to." 

already he regret bitter have lost control of himself. something 
in the phrase of her sentence chill him. he knew the fear of 
embark upon an unknown and dangerous sea. 

"you will take part in our real life, i mean," she add softly, with an 
indescribable coax of manner, as though she notice his shrinking. 
"you will come back to us." 

already this slip of a child seem to dominate him; he felt her power 
coming over him more and more; something emanate from her that stole 
over his senses and made him aware that her personality, for all its 
simple grace, held forces that were stately, imposing, august. he saw 
her again moving through smoke and flame amid broken and tempestuous 
scenery, alarming strong, her terrible mother by her side. dim this 
shone through her smile and appearance of charming innocence. 

"you will, i know," she repeated, holding him with her eyes. 

they were quite alone up there on the ramparts, and the sensation that 
she was overmaster him stir a wild sensuous in his blood. the 
mingle abandon and reserve in her attract him furiously, and all of 
him that was man rose up and resist the creep influence, at the 
same time acclaim it with the full delight of his forgotten youth. an 
irresistible desire came to him to question her, to summon what still 
remain to him of his own little personality in an effort to retain the 
right to his normal self. 

the girl had grown quiet again, and was now leaning on the broad wall 
close beside him, gaze out across the darken plain, her elbow on 
the coping, motionless as a figure carve in stone. he took his courage 
in both hands. 

"tell me, ilsé," he said, unconscious imitate her own purr 
soft of voice, yet aware that he was utterly in earnest, "what is 
the meaning of this town, and what is this real life you speak of? and 
why is it that the people watch me from morning to night? tell me what 
it all means? and, tell me," he add more quick with passion in his 
voice, "what you really are--yourself?" 

she turn her head and look at him through half-closed eyelids, her 
grow inner excitement betray itself by the faint colour that ran 
like a shadow across her face. 

"it seem to me,"--he falter oddly under her gaze--"that i have some 
right to know--" 

sudden she open her eyes to the full. "you love me, then?" she ask 
softly. 

"i swear," he cry impetuously, move as by the force of a rising tide, 
"i never felt before--i have never known any other girl who--" 

"then you _have_ the right to know," she calm interrupt his confuse 
confession, "for love shares all secrets." 

she paused, and a thrill like fire ran swift through him. her words 
lift him off the earth, and he felt a radiant happiness, follow 
almost the same instant in horrible contrast by the thought of death. he 
became aware that she had turn her eyes upon his own and was speak 
again. 

"the real life i speak of," she whispered, "is the old, old life within, 
the life of long ago, the life to which you, too, once belonged, and to 
which you still belong." 

a faint wave of memory trouble the deep of his soul as her low voice 
sank into him. what she was saying he knew instinctive to be true, 
even though he could not as yet understand its full purport. his present 
life seem slip from him as he listened, merge his personality in 
one that was far old and greater. it was this loss of his present self 
that brought to him the thought of death. 

"you came here," she went on, "with the purpose of seek it, and the 
people felt your presence and are wait to know what you decide, 
whether you will leave them without have found it, or whether--" 

her eyes remain fixed upon his own, but her face began to change, 
grow large and dark with an expression of age. 

"it is their thought constant play about your soul that make you 
feel they watch you. they do not watch you with their eyes. the purpose 
of their inner life are calling to you, seek to claim you. you were 
all part of the same life long, long ago, and now they want you back 
again among them." 

vezin's timid heart sank with dread as he listened; but the girl's eyes 
held him with a net of joy so that he had no wish to escape. she 
fascinate him, as it were, clean out of his normal self. 

"alone, however, the people could never have caught and held you," she 
resumed. "the motive force was not strong enough; it has fade through 
all these years. but i"--she pause a moment and look at him with 
complete confidence in her splendid eyes--"i possess the spell to 
conquer you and hold you: the spell of old love. i can win you back 
again and make you live the old life with me, for the force of the 
ancient tie between us, if i choose to use it, is irresistible. and i do 
choose to use it. i still want you. and you, dear soul of my dim 
past"--she pressed close to him so that her breath pass across his 
eyes, and her voice positively sang--"i mean to have you, for you love 
me and are utterly at my mercy." 

vezin heard, and yet did not hear; understood, yet did not understand. 
he had pass into a condition of exaltation. the world was beneath his 
feet, made of music and flowers, and he was flying somewhere far above 
it through the sunshine of pure delight. he was breathless and giddy 
with the wonder of her words. they intoxicate him. and, still, the 
terror of it all, the dreadful thought of death, pressed ever behind her 
sentences. for flame shot through her voice out of black smoke and 
lick at his soul. 

and they communicate with one another, it seem to him, by a process 
of swift telepathy, for his france could never have compass all he 
said to her. yet she understood perfectly, and what she said to him was 
like the recital of verse long since known. and the mingle pain and 
sweet of it as he listen were almost more than his little soul 
could hold. 

"yet i came here wholly by chance--" he heard himself saying. 

"no," she cry with passion, "you came here because i call to you. i 
have call to you for years, and you came with the whole force of the 
past behind you. you had to come, for i own you, and i claim you." 

she rose again and move closer, look at him with a certain insole 
in the face--the insole of power. 

the sun had set behind the tower of the old cathedral and the dark 
rose up from the plain and envelop them. the music of the band had 
ceased. the leaves of the plane tree hung motionless, but the chill of 
the autumn evening rose about them and made vezin shiver. there was no 
sound but the sound of their voice and the occasional soft rustle of 
the girl's dress. he could hear the blood rush in his ears. he 
scarcely realise where he was or what he was doing. some terrible magic 
of the imagination drew him deep down into the tomb of his own being, 
telling him in no unfaltering voice that her words shadow forth the 
truth. and this simple little france maid, speak beside him with so 
strange authority, he saw curious alter into quite another being. as 
he stare into her eyes, the picture in his mind grew and lived, 
dressing itself vivid to his inner vision with a degree of reality he 
was compel to acknowledge. as once before, he saw her tall and 
stately, moving through wild and broken scenery of forest and mountain 
caverns, the glare of flame behind her head and cloud of shift 
smoke about her feet. dark leaves encircle her hair, flying loose in 
the wind, and her limb shone through the merest rag of clothing. 
other were about her, too, and ardent eyes on all side cast delirious 
glance upon her, but her own eyes were always for one only, one whom 
she held by the hand. for she was leading the dance in some tempestuous 
orgy to the music of chant voices, and the dance she led circle 
about a great and awful figure on a throne, brood over the scene 
through lurid vapours, while innumerable other wild face and form 
crowded furiously about her in the dance. but the one she held by the 
hand he knew to be himself, and the monstrous shape upon the throne he 
knew to be her mother. 

the vision rose within him, rush to him down the long years of bury 
time, crying aloud to him with the voice of memory reawakened.... and 
then the scene fade away and he saw the clear circle of the girl's eyes 
gaze steadfast into his own, and she became once more the pretty 
little daughter of the innkeeper, and he found his voice again. 

"and you," he whisper tremblingly--"you child of vision and 
enchantment, how is it that you so bewitch me that i love you even 
before i saw?" 

she drew herself up beside him with an air of rare dignity. 

"the call of the past," she said; "and besides," she add proudly, "in 
the real life i am a princess--" 

"a princess!" he cried. 

"--and my mother is a queen!" 

at this, little vezin utterly lost his head. delight tore at his heart 
and swept him into sheer ecstasy. to hear that sweet singing voice, and 
to see those adorable little lip utter such things, upset his balance 
beyond all hope of control. he took her in his arms and cover her 
unresist face with kisses. 

but even while he did so, and while the hot passion swept him, he felt 
that she was soft and loathsome, and that her answer kiss stain 
his very soul.... and when, presently, she had free herself and 
vanish into the darkness, he stood there, leaning against the wall in 
a state of collapse, creep with horror from the touch of her yielding 
body, and inward rage at the weakness that he already dim 
realise must prove his undoing. 

and from the shadow of the old building into which she disappear 
there rose in the still of the night a singular, long-drawn cry, 
which at first he took for laughter, but which later he was sure he 
recognise as the almost human wail of a cat. 


v 

for a long time vezin leant there against the wall, alone with his 
surge thought and emotions. he understood at length that he had done 
the one thing necessary to call down upon him the whole force of this 
ancient past. for in those passionate kiss he had acknowledge the tie 
of olden days, and had revive it. and the memory of that soft 
impalpable caress in the dark of the inn corridor came back to him 
with a shudder. the girl had first master him, and then led him to the 
one act that was necessary for her purpose. he had been waylaid, after 
the lapse of centuries--caught, and conquered. 

dim he realise this, and sought to make plan for his escape. but, 
for the moment at any rate, he was powerless to manage his thought or 
will, for the sweet, fantastic madness of the whole adventure mount to 
his brain like a spell, and he glory in the feeling that he was 
utterly enchant and moving in a world so much large and wild than 
the one he had ever been accustomed to. 

the moon, pale and enormous, was just rising over the sea-like plain, 
when at last he rose to go. her slant ray drew all the house into 
new perspective, so that their roofs, already glisten with dew, 
seem to stretch much higher into the sky than usual, and their gable 
and quaint old tower lay far away in its purple reaches. 

the cathedral appear unreal in a silver mist. he move softly, keeping 
to the shadows; but the street were all desert and very silent; the 
door were closed, the shutter fastened. not a soul was astir. the hush 
of night lay over everything; it was like a town of the dead, a 
churchyard with gigantic and grotesque tombstones. 

wonder where all the busy life of the day had so utterly disappear 
to, he made his way to a back door that enter the inn by means of the 
stables, thinking thus to reach his room unobserved. he reach the 
courtyard safe and cross it by keeping close to the shadow of the 
wall. he sidle down it, mince along on tiptoe, just as the old men 
did when they enter the _salle à manger_. he was horrify to find 
himself do this instinctively. a strange impulse came to him, 
catching him somehow in the centre of his body--an impulse to drop upon 
all fours and run swift and silently. he glance upwards and the idea 
came to him to leap up upon his window-sill overhead instead of go 
round by the stairs. this occur to him as the easiest, and most 
natural way. it was like the beginning of some horrible transformation 
of himself into something else. he was fearful strung up. 

the moon was higher now, and the shadow very dark along the side of the 
street where he moved. he kept among the deepest of them, and reach 
the porch with the glass doors. 

but here there was light; the inmates, unfortunately, were still about. 
hope to slip across the hall unobserved and reach the stairs, he 
open the door careful and stole in. then he saw that the hall was 
not empty. a large dark thing lay against the wall on his left. at first 
he thought it must be household articles. then it moved, and he thought 
it was an immense cat, distort in some way by the play of light and 
shadow. then it rose straight up before him and he saw that it was the 
proprietress. 

what she had been do in this position he could only venture a 
dreadful guess, but the moment she stood up and face him he was aware 
of some terrible dignity clothing her about that instantly recall the 
girl's strange saying that she was a queen. huge and sinister she stood 
there under the little oil lamp; alone with him in the empty hall. awe 
stir in his heart, and the roots of some ancient fear. he felt that 
he must bow to her and make some kind of obeisance. the impulse was 
fierce and irresistible, as of long habit. he glance quick about him. 
there was no one there. then he deliberate inclined his head toward 
her. he bowed. 

"enfin! m'sieur s'est donc décidé. c'est bien alors. j'en sui 
contente." 

her words came to him sonorous as through a great open space. 

then the great figure came sudden across the flag hall at him and 
seize his tremble hands. some overpowering force move with her and 
caught him. 

"on pourrait faire un p'tit tour ensemble, n'est-ce pas? nous y allon 
cette nuit et il faut s'exercer un peu d'avance pour cela. ilsé, ilsé, 
vien donc ici. vien vite!" 

and she whirl him round in the opening steps of some dance that seem 
oddly and horrible familiar. they made no sound on the stones, this 
strange assorted couple. it was all soft and stealthy. and presently, 
when the air seem to thicken like smoke, and a red glare as of flame 
shot through it, he was aware that some one else had join them and 
that his hand the mother had release was now tight held by the 
daughter. ilsé had come in answer to the call, and he saw her with 
leaves of vervain twin in her dark hair, clothe in tattered vestige 
of some curious garment, beautiful as the night, and horribly, odiously, 
loathsome seductive. 

"to the sabbath! to the sabbath!" they cried. "on to the witches' 
sabbath!" 

up and down that narrow hall they danced, the women on each side of him, 
to the wildest measure he had ever imagined, yet which he dimly, 
dreadfully remembered, till the lamp on the wall flicker and went out, 
and they were left in total darkness. and the devil woke in his heart 
with a thousand vile suggestion and made him afraid. 

sudden they release his hand and he heard the voice of the mother 
cry that it was time, and they must go. which way they went he did not 
pause to see. he only realise that he was free, and he blunder 
through the dark till he found the stairs and then tore up them to 
his room as though all hell was at his heels. 

he flung himself on the sofa, with his face in his hands, and groaned. 
swift review a dozen ways of immediate escape, all equally 
impossible, he finally decided that the only thing to do for the moment 
was to sit quiet and wait. he must see what was go to happen. at 
least in the privacy of his own bedroom he would be fairly safe. the 
door was locked. he cross over and soft open the window which gave 
upon the courtyard and also permit a partial view of the hall through 
the glass doors. 

as he did so the hum and murmur of a great activity reach his ear 
from the street beyond--the sound of footstep and voice muffle by 
distance. he lean out cautious and listened. the moonlight was clear 
and strong now, but his own window was in shadow, the silver disc being 
still behind the house. it came to him irresistible that the inhabitant 
of the town, who a little while before had all been invisible behind 
closed doors, were now issue forth, busy upon some secret and unholy 
errand. he listen intently. 

at first everything about him was silent, but soon he became aware of 
movements go on in the house itself. rustling and cheep came to 
him across that still, moonlit yard. a concourse of living being sent 
the hum of their activity into the night. things were on the move 
everywhere. a biting, pungent odour rose through the air, coming he knew 
not whence. presently his eyes became glue to the window of the 
opposite wall where the moonshine fell in a soft blaze. the roof 
overhead, and behind him, was reflect clearly in the pane of glass, 
and he saw the outline of dark body moving with long footstep over 
the tile and along the coping. they pass swift and silently, shaped 
like immense cats, in an endless procession across the picture glass, 
and then appear to leap down to a lower level where he lost sight of 
them. he just caught the soft thud of their leaps. sometimes their 
shadow fell upon the white wall opposite, and then he could not make 
out whether they were the shadow of human being or of cats. they 
seem to change swift from one to the other. the transformation 
look horrible real, for they leap like human beings, yet change 
swift in the air immediately afterwards, and drop like animals. 

the yard, too, beneath him, was now alive with the creep movements of 
dark form all stealthy drawing towards the porch with the glass 
doors. they kept so close to the wall that he could not determine 
their actual shape, but when he saw that they pass on to the great 
congregation that was gathering in the hall, he understood that these 
were the creature whose leap shadow he had first seen reflect in 
the windowpane opposite. they were coming from all parts of the town, 
reach the appoint meeting-place across the roof and tiles, and 
spring from level to level till they came to the yard. 

then a new sound caught his ear, and he saw that the window all about 
him were being soft opened, and that to each window came a face. a 
moment later figures began drop hurried down into the yard. and 
these figures, as they lower themselves down from the windows, were 
human, he saw; but once safe in the yard they fell upon all fours and 
change in the swiftest possible second into--cats--huge, silent cats. 
they ran in stream to join the main body in the hall beyond. 

so, after all, the rooms in the house had not been empty and unoccupied. 

moreover, what he saw no long fill him with amazement. for he 
remember it all. it was familiar. it had all happen before just so, 
hundred of times, and he himself had taken part in it and known the 
wild madness of it all. the outline of the old building changed, the 
yard grew larger, and he seem to be staring down upon it from a much 
greater height through smoky vapours. and, as he looked, half 
remembering, the old pains of long ago, fierce and sweet, furiously 
assail him, and the blood stir horrible as he heard the call of the 
dance again in his heart and taste the ancient magic of ilsé whirl 
by his side. 

sudden he start back. a great lithe cat had leap soft up from 
the shadow below on to the sill close to his face, and was staring 
fixedly at him with the eyes of a human. "come," it seem to say, "come 
with us to the dance! change as of old! transform yourself swift and 
come!" only too well he understood the creature's soundless call. 

it was gone again in a flash with scarcely a sound of its pad feet 
on the stones, and then other drop by the score down the side of 
the house, past his very eyes, all change as they fell and dart 
away rapidly, softly, towards the gathering point. and again he felt the 
dreadful desire to do likewise; to murmur the old incantation, and then 
drop upon hand and knee and run swift for the great flying leap into 
the air. oh, how the passion of it rose within him like a flood, 
twist his very entrails, send his heart's desire flaming forth 
into the night for the old, old dance of the sorcerer at the witches' 
sabbath! the whirl of the stars was about him; once more he met the 
magic of the moon. the power of the wind, rush from precipice and 
forest, leap from cliff to cliff across the valleys, tore him 
away.... he heard the cries of the dance and their wild laughter, and 
with this savage girl in his embrace he dance furiously about the dim 
throne where sat the figure with the sceptre of majesty.... 

then, suddenly, all became hush and still, and the fever die down a 
little in his heart. the calm moonlight flood a courtyard empty and 
deserted. they had started. the procession was off into the sky. and he 
was left behind--alone. 

vezin tiptoe soft across the room and unlock the door. the murmur 
from the streets, grow momentarily as he advanced, met his ears. he 
made his way with the utmost caution down the corridor. at the head of 
the stairs he pause and listened. below him, the hall where they had 
gather was dark and still, but through open door and window on the 
far side of the building came the sound of a great throng moving farther 
and farther into the distance. 

he made his way down the creak wooden stairs, dread yet longing to 
meet some straggle who should point the way, but finding no one; across 
the dark hall, so lately throng with living, moving things, and out 
through the open front door into the street. he could not believe 
that he was really left behind, really forgotten, that he had been 
purposely permit to escape. it perplexed him. 

nervous he peer about him, and up and down the street; then, seeing 
nothing, advanced slow down the pavement. 

the whole town, as he went, show itself empty and deserted, as though 
a great wind had blown everything alive out of it. the door and window 
of the house stood open to the night; nothing stirred; moonlight and 
silence lay over all. the night lay about him like a cloak. the air, 
soft and cool, caress his cheek like the touch of a great furry paw. 
he gain confidence and began to walk quickly, though still keeping to 
the shadow side. nowhere could he discover the faintest sign of the 
great unholy exodus he knew had just taken place. the moon sail high 
over all in a sky cloudless and serene. 

hardly realise where he was going, he cross the open market-place 
and so came to the ramparts, whence he knew a pathway descended to the 
high road and along which he could make good his escape to one of the 
other little town that lay to the northward, and so to the railway. 

but first he pause and gaze out over the scene at his feet where the 
great plain lay like a silver map of some dream country. the still 
beauty of it enter his heart, increase his sense of bewilder and 
unreality. no air stirred, the leaves of the plane tree stood 
motionless, the near detail were define with the sharp of day 
against dark shadows, and in the distance the field and wood melt 
away into haze and shimmer mistiness. 

but the breath caught in his throat and he stood stockstill as though 
transfix when his gaze pass from the horizon and fell upon the near 
prospect in the depth of the valley at his feet. the whole lower slope 
of the hill, that lay hid from the bright of the moon, were aglow, 
and through the glare he saw countless moving forms, shift thick and 
fast between the opening of the trees; while overhead, like leaves 
driven by the wind, he discern flying shape that hover dark one 
moment against the sky and then settled down with cries and weird 
singing through the branch into the region that was aflame. 

spellbound, he stood and stare for a time that he could not measure. 
and then, move by one of the terrible impulse that seem to control 
the whole adventure, he climb swift upon the top of the broad 
coping, and balanced a moment where the valley gape at his feet. but in 
that very instant, as he stood hovering, a sudden movement among the 
shadow of the house caught his eye, and he turn to see the outline 
of a large animal dart swift across the open space behind him, and 
land with a flying leap upon the top of the wall a little lower down. it 
ran like the wind to his feet and then rose up beside him upon the 
ramparts. a shiver seem to run through the moonlight, and his sight 
tremble for a second. his heart pulse fearfully. ilsé stood beside 
him, peer into his face. 

some dark substance, he saw, stain the girl's face and skin, shining 
in the moonlight as she stretch her hand towards him; she was dress 
in wretched tattered garment that yet became her mightily; rue and 
vervain twin about her temples; her eyes glitter with unholy light. 
he only just control the wild impulse to take her in his arms and 
leap with her from their giddy perch into the valley below. 

"see!" she cried, point with an arm on which the rag flutter in 
the rising wind towards the forest aglow in the distance. "see where 
they await us! the wood are alive! already the great one are there, 
and the dance will soon begin! the salve is here! anoint yourself and 
come!" 

though a moment before the sky was clear and cloudless, yet even while 
she spoke the face of the moon grew dark and the wind began to toss in 
the crest of the plane tree at his feet. stray gust brought the 
sound of hoarse singing and crying from the lower slope of the hill, 
and the pungent odour he had already notice about the courtyard of the 
inn rose about him in the air. 

"transform, transform!" she cry again, her voice rising like a song. 
"rub well your skin before you fly. come! come with me to the sabbath, 
to the madness of its furious delight, to the sweet abandon of its 
evil worship! see! the great one are there, and the terrible sacrament 
prepared. the throne is occupied. anoint and come! anoint and come!" 

she grew to the height of a tree beside him, leap upon the wall with 
flaming eyes and hair strewn upon the night. he too began to change 
swiftly. her hand touched the skin of his face and neck, streak him 
with the burning salve that sent the old magic into his blood with the 
power before which fade all that is good. 

a wild roar came up to his ear from the heart of the wood, and the 
girl, when she heard it, leap upon the wall in the frenzy of her 
wicked joy. 

"satan is there!" she screamed, rush upon him and strive to draw 
him with her to the edge of the wall. "satan has come. the sacrament 
call us! come, with your dear apostate soul, and we will worship and 
dance till the moon die and the world is forgotten!" 

just saving himself from the dreadful plunge, vezin struggle to release 
himself from her grasp, while the passion tore at his reins and all but 
master him. he shriek aloud, not knowing what he said, and then he 
shriek again. it was the old impulses, the old awful habit 
instinctive finding voice; for though it seem to him that he merely 
shriek nonsense, the words he utter really had meaning in them, and 
were intelligible. it was the ancient call. and it was heard below. it 
was answered. 

the wind whistle at the skirt of his coat as the air round him 
darken with many flying form crowd upwards out of the valley. the 
crying of hoarse voice smote upon his ears, coming closer. stroke of 
wind buffet him, tear him this way and that along the crumble top 
of the stone wall; and ilsé clung to him with her long shining arms, 
smooth and bare, holding him fast about the neck. but not ilsé alone, 
for a dozen of them surround him, drop out of the air. the 
pungent odour of the anoint body stifle him, exciting him to the 
old madness of the sabbath, the dance of the witch and sorcerer do 
honour to the personify evil of the world. 

"anoint and away! anoint and away!" they cry in wild chorus about him. 
"to the dance that never dies! to the sweet and fearful fantasy of 
evil!" 

another moment and he would have yield and gone, for his will turn 
soft and the flood of passionate memory all but overwhelm him, 
when--so can a small thing after the whole course of an adventure--he 
caught his foot upon a loose stone in the edge of the wall, and then 
fell with a sudden crash on to the ground below. but he fell towards the 
houses, in the open space of dust and cobblestones, and fortunately not 
into the gape depth of the valley on the farther side. 

and they, too, came in a tumble heap about him, like flies upon a 
piece of food, but as they fell he was release for a moment from the 
power of their touch, and in that brief instant of freedom there flash 
into his mind the sudden intuition that save him. before he could 
regain his feet he saw them scrabble awkward back upon the wall, as 
though bat-like they could only fly by drop from a height, and had 
no hold upon him in the open. then, seeing them perch there in a row 
like cat upon a roof, all dark and singularly shapeless, their eyes 
like lamps, the sudden memory came back to him of ilsé's terror at the 
sight of fire. 

quick as a flash he found his match and lit the dead leaves that lay 
under the wall. 

dry and withered, they caught fire at once, and the wind carry the 
flame in a long line down the length of the wall, licking upwards as it 
ran; and with shriek and wailings, the crowded row of form upon the 
top melt away into the air on the other side, and were gone with a 
great rush and whirr of their body down into the heart of the 
haunt valley, leave vezin breathless and shaken in the middle of the 
desert ground. 

"ilsé!" he call feebly; "ilsé!" for his heart ache to think that she 
was really gone to the great dance without him, and that he had lost the 
opportunity of its fearful joy. yet at the same time his relief was so 
great, and he was so daze and trouble in mind with the whole thing, 
that he hardly knew what he was saying, and only cry aloud in the 
fierce storm of his emotion.... 

the fire under the wall ran its course, and the moonlight came out 
again, soft and clear, from its temporary eclipse. with one last 
shudder look at the ruin ramparts, and a feeling of horrid wonder 
for the haunt valley beyond, where the shape still crowded and flew, 
he turn his face towards the town and slow made his way in the 
direction of the hotel. 

and as he went, a great wail of cries, and a sound of howling, 
follow him from the gleam forest below, grow faint and faint 
with the burst of wind as he disappear between the houses. 

vi 

"it may seem rather abrupt to you, this sudden tame ending," said arthur 
vezin, glancing with flushed face and timid eyes at dr. silence sitting 
there with his notebook, "but the fact is--er--from that moment my 
memory seem to have fail rather. i have no distinct recollection of 
how i got home or what precisely i did. 

"it appear i never went back to the inn at all. i only dim recollect 
racing down a long white road in the moonlight, past wood and villages, 
still and deserted, and then the dawn came up, and i saw the tower of a 
biggish town and so came to a station. 

"but, long before that, i remember pause somewhere on the road and 
look back to where the hill-town of my adventure stood up in the 
moonlight, and thinking how exactly like a great monstrous cat it lay 
there upon the plain, its huge front paw lie down the two main 
streets, and the twin and broken tower of the cathedral marking its 
torn ear against the sky. that picture stays in my mind with the utmost 
vivid to this day. 

"another thing remains in my mind from that escape--namely, the sudden 
sharp reminder that i had not paid my bill, and the decision i made, 
standing there on the dusty highroad, that the small baggage i had left 
behind would more than settle for my indebtedness. 

"for the rest, i can only tell you that i got coffee and bread at a café 
on the outskirts of this town i had come to, and soon after found my way 
to the station and caught a train later in the day. that same evening i 
reach london." 

"and how long altogether," ask john silence quietly, "do you think you 
stay in the town of the adventure?" 

vezin look up sheepishly. 

"i was coming to that," he resumed, with apologetic wriggle of his 
body. "in london i found that i was a whole week out in my reckoning of 
time. i had stay over a week in the town, and it ought to have been 
september 15th,--instead of which it was only september 10th!" 

"so that, in reality, you had only stay a night or two in the inn?" 
query the doctor. 

vezin hesitate before replying. he shuffle upon the mat. 

"i must have gain time somewhere," he said at length--"somewhere or 
somehow. i certainly had a week to my credit. i can't explain it. i can 
only give you the fact." 

"and this happen to you last year, since when you have never been back 
to the place?" 

"last autumn, yes," murmur vezin; "and i have never dare to go back. 
i think i never want to." 

"and, tell me," ask dr. silence at length, when he saw that the little 
man had evidently come to the end of his words and had nothing more to 
say, "had you ever read up the subject of the old witchcraft practice 
during the middle ages, or been at all interested in the subject?" 

"never!" declared vezin emphatically. "i had never given a thought to 
such matter so far as i know--" 

"or to the question of reincarnation, perhaps?" 

"never--before my adventure; but i have since," he reply 
significantly. 

there was, however, something still on the man's mind that he wish to 
relieve himself of by confession, yet could only with difficulty bring 
himself to mention; and it was only after the sympathetic tactful of 
the doctor had provided numerous opening that he at length avail 
himself of one of them, and stammer that he would like to show him the 
mark he still had on his neck where, he said, the girl had touched him 
with her anoint hands. 

he took off his collar after infinite fumble hesitation, and lower 
his shirt a little for the doctor to see. and there, on the surface of 
the skin, lay a faint reddish line across the shoulder and extend a 
little way down the back towards the spine. it certainly indicate 
exactly the position an arm might have taken in the act of embracing. 
and on the other side of the neck, slightly higher up, was a similar 
mark, though not quite so clearly defined. 

"that was where she held me that night on the ramparts," he whispered, a 
strange light coming and go in his eyes. 

* * * * * 

it was some week later when i again found occasion to consult john 
silence concerning another extraordinary case that had come under my 
notice, and we fell to discuss vezin's story. since hearing it, the 
doctor had made investigate on his own account, and one of his 
secretary had discover that vezin's ancestor had actually live for 
generation in the very town where the adventure came to him. two of 
them, both women, had been try and convict as witches, and had been 
burn alive at the stake. moreover, it had not been difficult to prove 
that the very inn where vezin stay was built about 1700 upon the spot 
where the funeral pyre stood and the execution took place. the town 
was a sort of headquarters for all the sorcerer and witch of the 
entire region, and after conviction they were burnt there literally by 
scores. 

"it seem strange," continue the doctor, "that vezin should have 
remain ignorant of all this; but, on the other hand, it was not the 
kind of history that successive generation would have been anxious to 
keep alive, or to repeat to their children. therefore i am inclined to 
think he still know nothing about it. 

"the whole adventure seem to have been a very vivid revival of the 
memory of an early life, cause by coming directly into contact with 
the living forces still intense enough to hang about the place, and, by 
a most singular chance, too, with the very soul who had taken part with 
him in the event of that particular life. for the mother and daughter 
who impress him so strange must have been leading actors, with 
himself, in the scene and practice of witchcraft which at that period 
dominate the imagination of the whole country. 

"one has only to read the history of the times to know that these 
witch claim the power of transform themselves into various 
animals, both for the purpose of disguise and also to convey themselves 
swift to the scene of their imaginary orgies. lycanthropy, or the 
power to change themselves into wolves, was everywhere believe in, and 
the ability to transform themselves into cat by rubbing their body 
with a special salve or ointment provided by satan himself, found equal 
credence. the witchcraft trial abound in evidence of such universal 
beliefs." 

dr. silence quote chapter and verse from many writer on the subject, 
and show how every detail of vezin's adventure had a basis in the 
practice of those dark days. 

"but that the entire affair took place subjective in the man's own 
consciousness, i have no doubt," he went on, in reply to my questions; 
"for my secretary who has been to the town to investigate, discover 
his signature in the visitors' book, and prove by it that he had 
arrive on september 8th, and left sudden without pay his bill. he 
left two days later, and they still were in possession of his dirty 
brown bag and some tourist clothes. i paid a few franc in settlement of 
his debt, and have sent his luggage on to him. the daughter was absent 
from home, but the proprietress, a large woman very much as he describe 
her, told my secretary that he had seem a very strange, absent-minded 
kind of gentleman, and after his disappearance she had fear for a long 
time that he had met with a violent end in the neighbouring forest where 
he use to roam about alone. 

"i should like to have obtain a personal interview with the daughter 
so as to ascertain how much was subjective and how much actually took 
place with her as vezin told it. for her dread of fire and the sight of 
burning must, of course, have been the intuitive memory of her former 
painful death at the stake, and have thus explain why he fancy more 
than once that he saw her through smoke and flame." 

"and that mark on his skin, for instance?" i inquired. 

"merely the mark produce by hysterical brooding," he replied, "like 
the stigmata of the _religieuses_, and the bruise which appear on the 
body of hypnotise subject who have been told to expect them. this is 
very common and easily explained. only it seem curious that these mark 
should have remain so long in vezin's case. usually they disappear 
quickly." 

"obviously he is still thinking about it all, brooding, and living it 
all over again," i ventured. 

"probably. and this make me fear that the end of his trouble is not 
yet. we shall hear of him again. it is a case, alas! i can do little to 
alleviate." 

dr. silence spoke grave and with sad in his voice. 

"and what do you make of the frenchman in the train?" i ask 
further--"the man who warn him against the place, _à cause du sommeil 
et à cause des chats?_ surely a very singular incident?" 

"a very singular incident indeed," he made answer slowly, "and one i can 
only explain on the basis of a highly improbable coincidence--" 

"namely?" 

"that the man was one who had himself stay in the town and undergone 
there a similar experience. i should like to find this man and ask him. 
but the crystal is useless here, for i have no slightest clue to go 
upon, and i can only conclude that some singular psychic affinity, some 
force still active in his being out of the same past life, drew him thus 
to the personality of vezin, and enable him to fear what might happen 
to him, and thus to warn him as he did. 

"yes," he presently continued, half talk to himself, "i suspect in 
this case that vezin was swept into the vortex of forces arise out of 
the intense activity of a past life, and that he live over again a 
scene in which he had often play a leading part century before. for 
strong action set up forces that are so slow to exhaust themselves, 
they may be said in a sense never to die. in this case they were not 
vital enough to render the illusion complete, so that the little man 
found himself caught in a very distressing confusion of the present and 
the past; yet he was sufficient sensitive to recognise that it was 
true, and to fight against the degrade of returning, even in 
memory, to a former and lower state of development. 

"ah yes!" he continued, crossing the floor to gaze at the darken sky, 
and seemingly quite oblivious of my presence, "subliminal up-rushes of 
memory like this can be exceedingly painful, and sometimes exceedingly 
dangerous. i only trust that this gentle soul may soon escape from this 
obsession of a passionate and tempestuous past. but i doubt it, i doubt 
it." 

his voice was hush with sad as he spoke, and when he turn back 
into the room again there was an expression of profound yearning upon 
his face, the yearning of a soul whose desire to help is sometimes 
greater than his power. 




case iii: the nemesis of fire 


i 

by some means which i never could fathom, john silence always contrived 
to keep the compartment to himself, and as the train had a clear run of 
two hour before the first stop, there was ample time to go over the 
preliminary fact of the case. he had telephone to me that very 
morning, and even through the disguise of the mile of wire the thrill 
of incalculable adventure had sound in his voice. 

"as if it were an ordinary country visit," he called, in reply to my 
question; "and don't forgot to bring your gun." 

"with blank cartridges, i suppose?" for i knew his rigid principles with 
regard to the taking of life, and guess that the gun were merely for 
some obvious purpose of disguise. 

then he thank me for coming, mention the train, snap down the 
receiver, and left me, vibrate with the excitement of anticipation, to 
do my packing. for the honour of accompany dr. john silence on one of 
his big case was what many would have considered an empty honour--and 
risky. certainly the adventure held all manner of possibilities, and i 
arrive at waterloo with the feelings of a man who is about to embark on 
some dangerous and peculiar mission in which the danger he expect to 
run will not be the ordinary danger to life and limb, but of some 
secret character difficult to name and still more difficult to cope 
with. 

"the manor house has a high sound," he told me, as we sat with our feet 
up and talked, "but i believe it is little more than an overgrown 
farmhouse in the desolate heather country beyond d----, and its owner, 
colonel wragge, a retired soldier with a taste for books, lives there 
practically alone, i understand, with an elderly invalid sister. so you 
need not look forward to a lively visit, unless the case provide some 
excitement of its own." 

"which is likely?" 

by way of reply he hand me a letter marked "private." it was dated a 
week ago, and sign "yours faithfully, horace wragge." 

"he heard of me, you see, through captain anderson," the doctor 
explain modestly, as though his fame were not almost world-wide; "you 
remember that indian obsession case--" 

i read the letter. why it should have been marked private was difficult 
to understand. it was very brief, direct, and to the point. it refer 
by way of introduction to captain anderson, and then state quite simply 
that the writer need help of a peculiar kind and ask for a personal 
interview--a morning interview, since it was impossible for him to be 
absent from the house at night. the letter was dignified even to the 
point of abruptness, and it is difficult to explain how it manage to 
convey to me the impression of a strong man, shaken and perplexed. 
perhaps the restraint of the wording, and the mystery of the affair had 
something to do with it; and the reference to the anderson case, the 
horror of which lay still vivid in my memory, may have touched the sense 
of something rather ominous and alarming. but, whatever the cause, there 
was no doubt that an impression of serious peril rose somehow out of 
that white paper with the few lines of firm writing, and the spirit of a 
deep uneasy ran between the words and reach the mind without any 
visible form of expression. 

"and when you saw him--?" i asked, return the letter as the train 
rush clatter noisy through clapham junction. 

"i have not seen him," was the reply. "the man's mind was charged to the 
brim when he wrote that; full of vivid mental pictures. notice the 
restraint of it. for the main character of his case psychometry could be 
depend upon, and the scrap of paper his hand has touched is sufficient 
to give to another mind--a sensitive and sympathetic mind--clear mental 
pictures of what is go on. i think i have a very sound general idea 
of his problem." 

"so there may be excitement, after all?" 

john silence wait a moment before he replied. 

"something very serious is amiss there," he said gravely, at length. 
"some one--not himself, i gather,--has been meddle with a rather 
dangerous kind of gunpowder. so--yes, there may be excitement, as you 
put it." 

"and my duties?" i asked, with a decidedly grow interest. "remember, 
i am your 'assistant.'" 

"behave like an intelligent confidential secretary. observe everything, 
without seeming to. say nothing--nothing that means anything. be present 
at all interviews. i may ask a good deal of you, for if my impression 
are correct this is--" 

he broke off suddenly. 

"but i won't tell you my impression yet," he resume after a moment's 
thought. "just watch and listen as the case proceeds. form your own 
impression and cultivate your intuitions. we come as ordinary visitors, 
of course," he added, a twinkle showing for an instant in his eye; 
"hence, the guns." 

though disappointed not to hear more, i recognise the wisdom of his 
words and knew how valueless my impression would be once the powerful 
suggestion of have heard his own lay behind them. i likewise reflect 
that intuition join to a sense of humour was of more use to a man than 
double the quantity of mere "brains," as such. 

before putt the letter away, however, he hand it back, telling me 
to place it against my forehead for a few moments and then describe any 
pictures that came spontaneous into my mind. 

"don't deliberate look for anything. just imagine you see the inside 
of the eyelid, and wait for pictures that rise against its dark screen." 

i follow his instructions, making my mind as nearly blank as possible. 
but no vision came. i saw nothing but the lines of light that pass to 
and fro like the change of a kaleidoscope across the blackness. a 
momentary sensation of warmth came and went curiously. 

"you see--what?" he ask presently. 

"nothing," i was oblige to admit disappointedly; "nothing but the usual 
flash of light one always sees. only, perhaps, they are more vivid 
than usual." 

he said nothing by way of comment or reply. 

"and they group themselves now and then," i continued, with painful 
candour, for i long to see the pictures he had spoken of, "group 
themselves into globe and round balls of fire, and the lines that flash 
about sometimes look like triangle and crosses--almost like geometric 
figures. nothing more." 

i open my eyes again, and gave him back the letter. 

"it make my head hot," i said, feeling somehow unworthy for not seeing 
anything of interest. but the look in his eyes arrest my attention at 
once. 

"that sensation of heat is important," he said significantly. 

"it was certainly real, and rather uncomfortable," i replied, hope he 
would expand and explain. "there was a distinct feeling of 
warmth--internal warmth somewhere--oppressive in a sense." 

"that is interesting," he remarked, putt the letter back in his 
pocket, and settle himself in the corner with newspaper and books. he 
vouchsafe nothing more, and i knew the useless of try to make 
him talk. following his example i settled likewise with magazine into 
my corner. but when i closed my eyes again to look for the flash 
lights and the sensation of heat, i found nothing but the usual 
phantasmagoria of the day's events--faces, scenes, memories,--and in due 
course i fell asleep and then saw nothing at all of any kind. 

when we left the train, after six hours' travelling, at a little 
wayside station standing without tree in a world of sand and heather, 
the late october shadow had already drop their sombre veil upon the 
landscape, and the sun dip almost out of sight behind the moorland 
hills. in a high dogcart, behind a fast horse, we were soon rattling 
across the undulate stretch of an open and bleak country, the keen 
air sting our cheek and the scent of pine and bracken strong about 
us. bare hill were faint visible against the horizon, and the 
coachman pointed to a bank of distant shadow on our left where he told 
us the sea lay. occasional stone farmhouses, standing back from the road 
among straggle fir trees, and large black barn that seem to shift 
past us with a movement of their own in the gloom, were the only sign 
of humanity and civilisation that we saw, until at the end of a bracing 
five mile the lights of the lodge gate flared before us and we plunge 
into a thick grove of pine tree that conceal the manor house up to 
the moment of actual arrival. 

colonel wragge himself met us in the hall. he was the typical army 
officer who had seen service, real service, and found himself in the 
process. he was tall and well built, broad in the shoulders, but lean as 
a greyhound, with grave eyes, rather stern, and a moustache turning 
grey. i judge him to be about sixty years of age, but his movements 
show a supple of strength and agile that contradict the years. 
the face was full of character and resolution, the face of a man to be 
depend upon, and the straight grey eyes, it seem to me, wore a veil 
of perplexed anxiety that he made no attempt to disguise. the whole 
appearance of the man at once clothe the adventure with gravity and 
importance. a matter that gave such a man cause for serious alarm, i 
felt, must be something real and of genuine moment. 

his speech and manner, as he welcome us, were like his letter, simple 
and sincere. he had a nature as direct and undeviate as a bullet. 
thus, he show plainly his surprise that dr. silence had not come 
alone. 

"my confidential secretary, mr. hubbard," the doctor said, introduce 
me, and the steady gaze and powerful shake of the hand i then received 
were well calculated, i remember thinking, to drive home the impression 
that here was a man who was not to be trifle with, and whose perplexity 
must spring from some very real and tangible cause. and, quite 
obviously, he was relieved that we had come. his welcome was 
unmistakable genuine. 

he led us at once into a room, half library, half smoking-room, that 
open out of the low-ceilinged hall. the manor house gave the 
impression of a rambling and glorify farmhouse, solid, ancient, 
comfortable, and wholly unpretentious. and so it was. only the heat of 
the place struck me as unnatural. this room with the blazing fire may 
have seem uncomfortable warm after the long drive through the night 
air; yet it seem to me that the hall itself, and the whole atmosphere 
of the house, breathe a warmth that hardly belong to well-filled 
grate or the pipes of hot air and water. it was not the heat of the 
greenhouse; it was an oppressive heat that somehow got into the head and 
mind. it stir a curious sense of uneasy in me, and i caught 
myself thinking of the sensation of warmth that had emanate from the 
letter in the train. 

i heard him thank dr. silence for have come; there was no preamble, 
and the exchange of civility was of the briefest description. 
evidently here was a man who, like my companion, love action rather 
than talk. his manner was straightforward and direct. i saw him in a 
flash: puzzled, worried, harass into a state of alarm by something he 
could not comprehend; forced to deal with things he would have prefer 
to despise, yet facing it all with dogged serious and making no 
attempt to conceal that he felt secret ashamed of his incompetence. 

"so i cannot offer you much entertainment beyond that of my own company, 
and the queer business that has been go on here, and is still go 
on," he said, with a slight inclination of the head towards me by way of 
including me in his confidence. 

"i think, colonel wragge," reply john silence impressively, "that we 
shall none of us find the time hang heavy. i gather we shall have our 
hand full." 

the two men look at one another for the space of some seconds, and 
there was an indefinable quality in their silence which for the first 
time made me admit a swift question into my mind; and i wonder a 
little at my rash in coming with so little reflection into a big 
case of this incalculable doctor. but no answer suggest itself, and to 
withdraw was, of course, inconceivable. the gate had closed behind me 
now, and the spirit of the adventure was already besiege my mind with 
its advance guard of a thousand little hope and fears. 

explain that he would wait till after dinner to discuss anything 
serious, as no reference was ever made before his sister, he led the way 
upstairs and show us personally to our rooms; and it was just as i was 
finish dressing that a knock came at my door and dr. silence entered. 

he was always what is call a serious man, so that even in moments of 
comedy you felt he never lost sight of the profound gravity of life, but 
as he came across the room to me i caught the expression of his face 
and understood in a flash that he was now in his most grave and earnest 
mood. he look almost troubled. i stop fumble with my black tie 
and stared. 

"it is serious," he said, speak in a low voice, "more so even than i 
imagined. colonel wragge's control over his thought conceal a great 
deal in my psychometrise of the letter. i look in to warn you to 
keep yourself well in hand--generally speaking." 

"haunted house?" i asked, conscious of a distinct shiver down my back. 

but he smile grave at the question. 

"haunted house of life more likely," he replied, and a look came into 
his eyes which i had only seen there when a human soul was in the toils 
and he was thick in the fight of rescue. he was stir in the deeps. 

"colonel wragge--or the sister?" i ask hurriedly, for the gong was 
sounding. 

"neither directly," he said from the door. "something far older, 
something very, very remote indeed. this thing has to do with the ages, 
unless i am mistaken greatly, the age on which the mists of memory have 
long lain undisturbed." 

he came across the floor very quick with a finger on his lips, look 
at me with a peculiar searching of gaze. 

"are you aware yet of anything--odd here?" he ask in a whisper. 
"anything you cannot quite define, for instance. tell me, hubbard, for i 
want to know all your impressions. they may help me." 

i shook my head, avoid his gaze, for there was something in the eyes 
that scared me a little. but he was so in earnest that i set my mind 
keen searching. 

"nothing yet," i reply truthfully, wish i could confess to a real 
emotion; "nothing but the strange heat of the place." 

he gave a little jump forward in my direction. 

"the heat again, that's it!" he exclaimed, as though glad of my 
corroboration. "and how would you describe it, perhaps?" he ask 
quickly, with a hand on the door knob. 

"it doesn't seem like ordinary physical heat," i said, casting about in 
my thought for a definition. 

"more a mental heat," he interrupted, "a glowing of thought and desire, 
a sort of feverish warmth of the spirit. isn't that it?" 

i admitted that he had exactly describe my sensations. 

"good!" he said, as he open the door, and with an indescribable 
gesture that combine a warning to be ready with a sign of praise for my 
correct intuition, he was gone. 

i hurried after him, and found the two men wait for me in front of 
the fire. 

"i ought to warn you," our host was saying as i came in, "that my 
sister, whom you will meet at dinner, is not aware of the real object of 
your visit. she is under the impression that we are interested in the 
same line of study--folklore--and that your research have led to my 
seek acquaintance. she come to dinner in her chair, you know. it 
will be a great pleasure to her to meet you both. we have few visitors." 

so that on enter the dining-room we were prepared to find miss wragge 
already at her place, seat in a sort of bath-chair. she was a 
vivacious and charming old lady, with smile expression and bright 
eyes, and she chat all through dinner with unfailing spontaneity. she 
had that face, unlined and fresh, that some people carry through life 
from the cradle to the grave; her smooth plump cheek were all pink and 
white, and her hair, still dark, was divide into two glossy and sleek 
halves on either side of a careful parting. she wore gold-rimmed 
glasses, and at her throat was a large scarab of green jasper that made 
a very handsome brooch. 

her brother and dr. silence talk little, so that most of the 
conversation was carry on between herself and me, and she told me a 
great deal about the history of the old house, most of which i fear i 
listen to with but half an ear. 

"and when cromwell stay here," she babble on, "he occupy the very 
rooms upstairs that use to be mine. but my brother think it safe for 
me to sleep on the ground floor now in case of fire." 

and this sentence has stay in my memory only because of the sudden way 
her brother interrupt her and instantly led the conversation on to 
another topic. the passing reference to fire seem to have disturbed 
him, and thenceforward he direct the talk himself. 

it was difficult to believe that this lively and animate old lady, 
sitting beside me and taking so eager an interest in the affair of 
life, was practically, we understood, without the use of her lower 
limbs, and that her whole existence for years had been pass between 
the sofa, the bed, and the bath-chair in which she chat so naturally 
at the dinner table. she made no allusion to her affliction until the 
dessert was reached, and then, touching a bell, she made us a witty 
little speech about leave us "like time, on noiseless feet," and was 
wheel out of the room by the butler and carry off to her apartments 
at the other end of the house. 

and the rest of us were not long in following suit, for dr. silence and 
myself were quite as eager to learn the nature of our errand as our host 
was to impart it to us. he led us down a long flag passage to a room 
at the very end of the house, a room provided with double doors, and 
windows, i saw, heavy shuttered. books line the wall on every side, 
and a large desk in the bow window was pile up with volumes, some open, 
some shut, some showing scraps of paper stuck between the leaves, and 
all smother in a general cataract of untidy foolscap and loose-half 
sheets. 

"my study and workroom," explain colonel wragge, with a delightful 
touch of innocent pride, as though he were a very serious scholar. he 
placed arm-chairs for us round the fire. "here," he add significantly, 
"we shall be safe from interrupt and can talk securely." 

during dinner the manner of the doctor had been all that was natural and 
spontaneous, though it was impossible for me, knowing him as i did, not 
to be aware that he was subconscious very keen alert and already 
receiving upon the ultra-sensitive surface of his mind various and vivid 
impressions; and there was now something in the gravity of his face, as 
well as in the significant tone of colonel wragge's speech, and 
something, too, in the fact that we three were shut away in this private 
chamber about to listen to things probably strange, and certainly 
mysterious--something in all this that touched my imagination sharp 
and sent an undeniable thrill along my nerves. taking the chair 
indicate by my host, i lit my cigar and wait for the opening of the 
attack, fully conscious that we were now too far gone in the adventure 
to admit of withdrawal, and wonder a little anxious where it was 
go to lead. 

what i expect precisely, it is hard to say. nothing definite, perhaps. 
only the sudden change was dramatic. a few hour before the prosaic 
atmosphere of piccadil was about me, and now i was sitting in a secret 
chamber of this remote old building wait to hear an account of things 
that held possibly the genuine heart of terror. i thought of the dreary 
moor and hill outside, and the dark pine copse sough in the wind 
of night; i remember my companion's singular words up in my bedroom 
before dinner; and then i turn and noted careful the stern 
countenance of the colonel as he face us and lit his big black cigar 
before speaking. 

the threshold of an adventure, i reflect as i wait for the first 
words, is always the most thrill moment--until the climax comes. 

but colonel wragge hesitated--mentally--a long time before he began. he 
talk brief of our journey, the weather, the country, and other 
comparatively trivial topics, while he sought about in his mind for an 
appropriate entry into the subject that was uppermost in the thought of 
all of us. the fact was he found it a difficult matter to speak of at 
all, and it was dr. silence who finally show him the way over the 
hedge. 

"mr. hubbard will take a few note when you are ready--you won't 
object," he suggested; "i can give my undivided attention in this way." 

"by all means," turning to reach some of the loose sheet on the writing 
table, and glancing at me. he still hesitate a little, i thought. "the 
fact is," he said apologetically, "i wonder if it was quite fair to 
trouble you so soon. the daylight might suit you better to hear what i 
have to tell. your sleep, i mean, might be less disturbed, perhaps." 

"i appreciate your thoughtfulness," john silence reply with his gentle 
smile, taking command as it were from that moment, "but really we are 
both quite immune. there is nothing, i think, that could prevent either 
of us sleeping, except--an outbreak of fire, or some such very physical 
disturbance." 

colonel wragge raise his eyes and look fixedly at him. this reference 
to an outbreak of fire i felt sure was made with a purpose. it certainly 
had the desire effect of remove from our host's manner the last sign 
of hesitancy. 

"forgive me," he said. "of course, i know nothing of your method in 
matter of this kind--so, perhaps, you would like me to begin at once 
and give you an outline of the situation?" 

dr. silence bowed his agreement. "i can then take my precaution 
accordingly," he add calmly. 

the soldier look up for a moment as though he did not quite gather the 
meaning of these words; but he made no further comment and turn at 
once to tackle a subject on which he evidently talk with diffidence 
and unwillingness. 

"it's all so utterly out of my line of things," he began, puff out 
cloud of cigar smoke between his words, "and there's so little to tell 
with any real evidence behind it, that it's almost impossible to make a 
consecutive story for you. it's the total cumulative effect that is 
so--so disquieting." he chose his words with care, as though determined 
not to travel one hair's breadth beyond the truth. 

"i came into this place twenty years ago when my elder brother died," he 
continued, "but could not afford to live here then. my sister, whom you 
met at dinner, kept house for him till the end, and during all these 
years, while i was seeing service abroad, she had an eye to the 
place--for we never got a satisfactory tenant--and saw that it was not 
allow to go to ruin. i myself took possession, however, only a year 
ago. 

"my brother," he went on, after a perceptible pause, "spent much of his 
time away, too. he was a great traveller, and fill the house with 
stuff he brought home from all over the world. the laundry--a small 
detached building beyond the servants' quarters--he turn into a 
regular little museum. the curio and things i have clear away--they 
collected dust and were always get broken--but the laundry-house you 
shall see tomorrow." 

colonel wragge spoke with such deliberation and with so many pause that 
this beginning took him a long time. but at this point he came to a full 
stop altogether. evidently there was something he wish to say that 
cost him considerable effort. at length he look up steady into my 
companion's face. 

"may i ask you--that is, if you won't think it strange," he said, and a 
sort of hush came over his voice and manner, "whether you have notice 
anything at all unusual--anything queer, since you came into the house?" 

dr. silence answer without a moment's hesitation. 

"i have," he said. "there is a curious sensation of heat in the place." 

"ah!" exclaim the other, with a slight start. "you _have_ notice it. 
this unaccountable heat--" 

"but its cause, i gather, is not in the house itself--but outside," i 
was astonish to hear the doctor add. 

colonel wragge rose from his chair and turn to unhook a frame map 
that hung upon the wall. i got the impression that the movement was made 
with the deliberate purpose of conceal his face. 

"your diagnosis, i believe, is amazing accurate," he said after a 
moment, turning round with the map in his hands. "though, of course, i 
can have no idea how you should guess--" 

john silence shrug his shoulder expressively. "merely my 
impression," he said. "if you pay attention to impressions, and do not 
allow them to be confuse by deduction of the intellect, you will often 
find them surprisingly, uncannily, accurate." 

colonel wragge resume his seat and laid the map upon his knees. his 
face was very thoughtful as he plunge abrupt again into his story. 

"on coming into possession," he said, look us alternate in the 
face, "i found a crop of story of the most extraordinary and 
impossible kind i had ever heard--stories which at first i treat with 
amuse indifference, but later was forced to regard seriously, if only 
to keep my servants. these story i thought i trace to the fact of my 
brother's death--and, in a way, i think so still." 

he leant forward and hand the map to dr. silence. 

"it's an old plan of the estate," he explained, "but accurate enough for 
our purpose, and i wish you would note the position of the plantation 
marked upon it, especially those near the house. that one," indicate 
the spot with his finger, "is call the twelve acre plantation. it was 
just there, on the side nearest the house, that my brother and the head 
keeper met their deaths." 

he spoke as a man forced to recognise fact that he deplored, and would 
have prefer to leave untouched--things he personally would rather 
have treat with ridicule if possible. it made his words peculiarly 
dignified and impressive, and i listen with an increase uneasy 
as to the sort of help the doctor would look to me for later. it seem 
as though i were a spectator of some drama of mystery in which any 
moment i might be summon to play a part. 

"it was twenty years ago," continue the colonel, "but there was much 
talk about it at the time, unfortunately, and you may, perhaps, have 
heard of the affair. stride, the keeper, was a passionate, hot-tempered 
man but i regret to say, so was my brother, and quarrel between them 
seem to have been frequent." 

"i do not recall the affair," said the doctor. "may i ask what was the 
cause of death?" something in his voice made me prick up my ear for the 
reply. 

"the keeper, it was said, from suffocation. and at the inquest the 
doctor aver that both men had been dead the same length of time when 
found." 

"and your brother?" ask john silence, notice the omission, and 
listen intently. 

"equally mysterious," said our host, speak in a low voice with 
effort. "but there was one distressing feature i think i ought to 
mention. for those who saw the face--i did not see it myself--and though 
stride carry a gun its chambers were undischarged--" he stammer 
and hesitate with confusion. again that sense of terror move between 
his words. he stuck. 

"yes," said the chief listener sympathetically. 

"my brother's face, they said, look as though it had been scorched. it 
had been swept, as it were, by something that burned--blasted. it was, i 
am told, quite dreadful. the body were found lie side by side, face 
downwards, both point away from the wood, as though they had been in 
the act of running, and not more than a dozen yard from its edge." 

dr. silence made no comment. he appear to be study the map 
attentively. 

"i did not see the face myself," repeated the other, his manner somehow 
express the sense of awe he contrived to keep out of his voice, "but 
my sister unfortunately did, and her present state i believe to be 
entire due to the shock it gave to her nerves. she never can be 
brought to refer to it, naturally, and i am even inclined to think that 
the memory has merciful been permit to vanish from her mind. but 
she spoke of it at the time as a face swept by flame--blasted." 

john silence look up from his contemplation of the map, but with the 
air of one who wish to listen, not to speak, and presently colonel 
wragge went on with his account. he stood on the mat, his broad 
shoulder hiding most of the mantelpiece. 

"they all centre about this particular plantation, these stories. that 
was to be expected, for the people here are as superstitious as ireland 
peasantry, and though i made one or two example among them to stop the 
foolish talk, it had no effect, and new version came to my ear every 
week. you may imagine how little good dismissal did, when i tell you 
that the servant dismiss themselves. it was not the house servants, 
but the men who work on the estate outside. the keeper gave notice 
one after another, none of them with any reason i could accept; the 
forester refuse to enter the wood, and the beater to beat in it. word 
flew all over the countryside that twelve acre plantation was a place to 
be avoided, day or night. 

"there came a point," the colonel went on, now well in his swing, "when 
i felt compel to make investigate on my own account. i could not 
kill the thing by ignore it; so i collected and analyse the story 
at first hand. for this twelve acre wood, you will see by the map, come 
rather near home. its lower end, if you will look, almost touch the 
end of the back lawn, as i will show you tomorrow, and its dense growth 
of pine form the chief protection the house enjoy from the east wind 
that blow up from the sea. and in olden days, before my brother 
interfere with it and frightened all the game away, it was one of the 
best pheasant covert on the whole estate." 

"and what form, if i may ask, did this interference take?" ask dr. 
silence. 

"in detail, i cannot tell you, for i do not know--except that i 
understand it was the subject of his frequent difference with the head 
keeper; but during the last two years of his life, when he gave up 
travel and settled down here, he took a special interest in this 
wood, and for some unaccountable reason began to build a low stone wall 
around it. this wall was never finished, but you shall see the ruins 
tomorrow in the daylight." 

"and the result of your investigations--these stories, i mean?" the 
doctor broke in, anxious to keep him to the main issues. 

"yes, i'm coming to that," he said slowly, "but the wood first, for this 
wood out of which they grew like mushroom has nothing in any way 
peculiar about it. it is very thick grown, and rise to a clear part 
in the centre, a sort of mound where there is a circle of large 
boulders--old druid stones, i'm told. at another place there's a small 
pond. there's nothing distinctive about it that i could mention--just an 
ordinary pine-wood, a very ordinary pine-wood--only the tree are a bit 
twist in the trunks, some of 'em, and very dense. nothing more. 

"and the stories? well, none of them had anything to do with my poor 
brother, or the keeper, as you might have expected; and they were all 
odd--such odd things, i mean, to invent or imagine. i never could make 
out how these people got such notions into their heads." 

he pause a moment to relight his cigar. 

"there's no regular path through it," he resumed, puff vigorously, 
"but the field round it are constant used, and one of the garden 
whose cottage lie over that way declared he often saw moving lights in 
it at night, and luminous shape like globe of fire over the tops of 
the trees, skim and floating, and making a soft hiss sound--most 
of 'em said that, in fact--and another man saw shape flit in and 
out among the trees, things that were neither men nor animals, and all 
faint luminous. no one ever pretended to see human forms--always 
queer, huge things they could not properly describe. sometimes the whole 
wood was lit up, and one fellow--he's still here and you shall see 
him--has a most circumstantial yarn about have seen great stars lie 
on the ground round the edge of the wood at regular intervals--" 

"what kind of stars?" put in john silence sharply, in a sudden way that 
made me start. 

"oh, i don't know quite; ordinary stars, i think he said, only very 
large, and apparently blazing as though the ground was alight. he was 
too terrify to go close and examine, and he has never seen them 
since." 

he stoop and stir the fire into a welcome blaze--welcome for its 
blaze of light rather than for its heat. in the room there was already a 
strange pervade sensation of warmth that was oppressive in its effect 
and far from comforting. 

"of course," he went on, straighten up again on the mat, "this was 
all commonplace enough--this seeing lights and figures at night. most of 
these fellow drink, and imagination and terror between them may account 
for almost anything. but other saw things in broad daylight. one of the 
woodmen, a sober, respectable man, took the shortcut home to his midday 
meal, and swore he was follow the whole length of the wood by 
something that never show itself, but dodge from tree to tree, always 
keeping out of sight, yet solid enough to make the branch sway and the 
twig snap on the ground. and it made a noise, he declared--but 
really"--the speaker stop and gave a short laugh--"it's too 
absurd--" 

"_please!_" insist the doctor; "for it is these small detail that 
give me the best clue always." 

"--it made a crackling noise, he said, like a bonfire. those were 
his very words: like the crackling of a bonfire," finished the soldier, 
with a repetition of his short laugh. 

"most interesting," dr. silence observe gravely. "please omit nothing." 

"yes," he went on, "and it was soon after that the fire began--the 
fire in the wood. they start mysterious burning in the patch of 
coarse white grass that cover the more open parts of the plantation. no 
one ever actually saw them start, but many, myself among the number, 
have seen them burning and smouldering. they are always small and 
circular in shape, and for all the world like a picnic fire. the head 
keeper has a dozen explanations, from sparks flying out of the house 
chimney to the sunlight focus through a dewdrop, but none of them, i 
must admit, convince me as being in the least likely or probable. they 
are most singular, i consider, most singular, these mysterious fires, 
and i am glad to say that they come only at rather long interval and 
never seem to spread. 

"but the keeper had other queer story as well, and about things that 
are verifiable. he declared that no life ever willing enter the 
plantation; more, that no life exist in it at all. no bird nest in 
the trees, or flew into their shade. he set countless traps, but never 
caught so much as a rabbit or a weasel. animal avoid it, and more 
than once he had picked up dead creature round the edge that bore no 
obvious sign of how they had met their death. 

"moreover, he told me one extraordinary tale about his retriever chase 
some invisible creature across the field one day when he was out with 
his gun. the dog sudden pointed at something in the field at his feet, 
and then gave chase, yelp like a mad thing. it follow its imaginary 
quarry to the border of the wood, and then went in--a thing he had 
never known it to do before. the moment it cross the edge--it is 
darkish in there even in daylight--it began fight in the most 
frenzied and terrific fashion. it made him afraid to interfere, he said. 
and at last, when the dog came out, hanging its tail down and panting, 
he found something like white hair stuck to its jaws, and brought it to 
show me. i tell you these detail because--" 

"they are important, believe me," the doctor stop him. "and you have 
it still, this hair?" he asked. 

"it disappear in the oddest way," the colonel explained. "it was 
curious look stuff, something like asbestos, and i sent it to be 
analyse by the local chemist. but either the man got wind of its 
origin, or else he didn't like the look of it for some reason, because 
he return it to me and said it was neither animal, vegetable, nor 
mineral, so far as he could make out, and he didn't wish to have 
anything to do with it. i put it away in paper, but a week later, on 
opening the package--it was gone! oh, the story are simply endless. i 
could tell you hundred all on the same lines." 

"and personal experience of your own, colonel wragge?" ask john 
silence earnestly, his manner showing the greatest possible interest and 
sympathy. 

the soldier gave an almost imperceptible start. he look distinct 
uncomfortable. 

"nothing, i think," he said slowly, "nothing--er--i should like to rely 
on. i mean nothing i have the right to speak of, perhaps--yet." 

his mouth closed with a snap. dr. silence, after wait a little to see 
if he would add to his reply, did not seek to press him on the point. 

"well," he resume presently, and as though he would speak 
contemptuously, yet dare not, "this sort of thing has gone on at 
interval ever since. it spread like wildfire, of course, mysterious 
chatter of this kind, and people began trespass all over the estate, 
coming to see the wood, and making themselves a general nuisance. 
notice of man-traps and spring-guns only seem to increase their 
persistence; and--think of it," he snorted, "some local research society 
actually wrote and ask permission for one of their member to spend a 
night in the wood! bold fools, who didn't write for leave, came and 
took away bit of bark from the tree and gave them to clairvoyants, who 
invent in their turn a further batch of tales. there was simply no end 
to it all." 

"most distressing and annoying, i can well believe," interpose the 
doctor. 

"then suddenly, the phenomena cease as mysterious as they had begun, 
and the interest flagged. the tale stopped. people got interested in 
something else. it all seem to die out. this was last july. i can tell 
you exactly, for i've kept a diary more or less of what happened." 

"ah!" 

"but now, quite recently, within the past three weeks, it has all 
revive again with a rush--with a kind of furious attack, so to speak. 
it has really become unbearable. you may imagine what it means, and the 
general state of affairs, when i say that the possibility of leave has 
occur to me." 

"incendiarism?" suggest dr. silence, half under his breath, but not so 
low that colonel wragge did not hear him. 

"by jove, sir, you take the very words out of my mouth!" exclaim the 
astonish man, glancing from the doctor to me and from me to the 
doctor, and rattling the money in his pocket as though some explanation 
of my friend's divine powers were to be found that way. 

"it's only that you are thinking very vividly," the doctor said quietly, 
"and your thought form pictures in my mind before you utter them. it's 
merely a little elementary thought-reading." 

his intention, i saw, was not to perplex the good man, but to impress 
him with his powers so as to ensure obedience later. 

"good lord! i had no idea--" he did not finish the sentence, and 
dive again abrupt into his narrative. 

"i did not see anything myself, i must admit, but the story of 
independent eye-witnesses were to the effect that lines of light, like 
stream of thin fire, move through the wood and sometimes were seen to 
shoot out precisely as flame might shoot out--in the direction of this 
house. there," he explained, in a loud voice that made me jump, 
point with a thick finger to the map, "where the westerly fringe of 
the plantation come up to the end of the lower lawn at the back of the 
house--where it links on to those dark patches, which are laurel 
shrubberies, running right up to the back premises--that's where these 
lights were seen. they pass from the wood to the shrubberies, and in 
this way reach the house itself. like silent rockets, one man 
describe them, rapid as lightning and exceedingly bright." 

"and this evidence you spoke of?" 

"they actually reach the side of the house. they've left a mark of 
scorching on the walls--the wall of the laundry building at the other 
end. you shall see 'em tomorrow." he pointed to the map to indicate the 
spot, and then straighten himself and glare about the room as though 
he had said something no one could believe and expect contradiction. 

"scorched--just as the face were," the doctor murmured, look 
significant at me. 

"scorched--yes," repeated the colonel, failing to catch the rest of the 
sentence in his excitement. 

there was a prolonged silence in the room, in which i heard the gurgle 
of the oil in the lamp and the click of the coal and the heavy 
breathing of our host. the most unwelcome sensation were creep about 
my spine, and i wonder whether my companion would scorn me utterly if 
i ask to sleep on the sofa in his room. it was eleven o'clock, i saw 
by the clock on the mantelpiece. we had cross the divide line and 
were now well in the movement of the adventure. the fight between my 
interest and my dread became acute. but, even if turning back had been 
possible, i think the interest would have easily gain the day. 

"i have enemies, of course," i heard the colonel's rough voice break 
into the pause presently, "and have discharge a number of 
servants---" 

"it's not that," put in john silence briefly. 

"you think not? in a sense i am glad, and yet--there are some things 
that can be met and dealt with--" 

he left the sentence unfinished, and look down at the floor with an 
expression of grim severity that betray a momentary glimpse of 
character. this fight man loathe and abhor the thought of an 
enemy he could not see and come to grip with. presently he move over 
and sat down in the chair between us. something like a sigh escape him. 
dr. silence said nothing. 

"my sister, of course, is kept in ignorance, as far as possible, of all 
this," he said disconnectedly, and as if talk to himself. "but even 
if she knew she would find matter-of-fact explanations. i only wish i 
could. i'm sure they exist." 

there came then an interval in the conversation that was very 
significant. it did not seem a real pause, or the silence real silence, 
for both men continue to think so rapid and strong that one almost 
imagine their thought clothe themselves in words in the air of the 
room. i was more than a little key up with the strange excitement of 
all i had heard, but what stimulate my nerves more than anything else 
was the obvious fact that the doctor was clearly upon the trail of 
discovery. in his mind at that moment, i believe, he had already solve 
the nature of this perplex psychic problem. his face was like a 
mask, and he employ the absolute minimum of gesture and words. all his 
energy were direct inwards, and by those incalculable method and 
process he had master with such infinite patience and study, i felt 
sure he was already in touch with the forces behind these singular 
phenomena and lay his deep plan for bring them into the open, and 
then effectively dealing with them. 

colonel wragge meanwhile grew more and more fidgety. from time to time 
he turn towards my companion, as though about to speak, yet always 
change his mind at the last moment. once he went over and open the 
door suddenly, apparently to see if any one were listen at the 
keyhole, for he disappear a moment between the two doors, and i then 
heard him open the outer one. he stood there for some seconds and made a 
noise as though he were sniff the air like a dog. then he closed both 
door cautious and came back to the fireplace. a strange excitement 
seem grow upon him. evidently he was try to make up his mind to 
say something that he found it difficult to say. and john silence, as i 
rightly judged, was wait patient for him to choose his own 
opportunity and his own way of saying it. at last he turn and face 
us, square his great shoulders, and stiffening perceptibly. 

dr. silence look up sympathetically. 

"your own experience help me most," he observe quietly. 

"the fact is," the colonel said, speak very low, "this past week 
there have been outbreak of fire in the house itself. three separate 
outbreaks--and all--in my sister's room." 

"yes," the doctor said, as if this was just what he had expect to 
hear. 

"utterly unaccountable--all of them," add the other, and then sat 
down. i began to understand something of the reason of his excitement. 
he was realise at last that the "natural" explanation he had held to 
all along was becoming impossible, and he hate it. it made him angry. 

"fortunately," he went on, "she was out each time and do not know. but 
i have made her sleep now in a room on the ground floor." 

"a wise precaution," the doctor said simply. he ask one or two 
questions. the fire had start in the curtains--once by the window and 
once by the bed. the third time smoke had been discover by the maid 
coming from the cupboard, and it was found that miss wragge's clothes 
hanging on the hook were smouldering. the doctor listen attentively, 
but made no comment. 

"and now can you tell me," he said presently, "what your own feeling 
about it is--your general impression?" 

"it sound foolish to say so," reply the soldier, after a moment's 
hesitation, "but i feel exactly as i have often felt on active service 
in my indian campaigns: just as if the house and all in it were in a 
state of siege; as though a conceal enemy were encamp about us--in 
ambush somewhere." he utter a soft nervous laugh. "as if the next sign 
of smoke would precipitate a panic--a dreadful panic." 

the picture came before me of the night shadow the house, and the 
twist pine tree he had describe crowd about it, conceal some 
powerful enemy; and, glancing at the resolute face and figure of the old 
soldier, forced at length to his confession, i understood something of 
all he had been through before he sought the assistance of john silence. 

"and tomorrow, unless i am mistaken, is full moon," said the doctor 
suddenly, watch the other's face for the effect of his apparently 
careless words. 

colonel wragge gave an uncontrollable start, and his face for the first 
time show unmistakable pallor. 

"what in the world---?" he began, his lip quivering. 

"only that i am beginning to see light in this extraordinary affair," 
return the other calmly, "and, if my theory is correct, each month 
when the moon is at the full should witness an increase in the activity 
of the phenomena." 

"i don't see the connection," colonel wragge answer almost savagely, 
"but i am bound to say my diary bear you out." he wore the most puzzle 
expression i have ever seen upon an honest face, but he abhor this 
additional corroboration of an explanation that perplexed him. 

"i confess," he repeated, "i cannot see the connection." 

"why should you?" said the doctor, with his first laugh that evening. he 
got up and hung the map upon the wall again. "but i do--because these 
things are my special study--and let me add that i have yet to come 
across a problem that is not natural, and has not a natural explanation. 
it's merely a question of how much one knows--and admits." 

colonel wragge eye him with a new and curious respect in his face. but 
his feelings were soothed. moreover, the doctor's laugh and change of 
manner came as a relief to all, and broke the spell of grave suspense 
that had held us so long. we all rose and stretch our limbs, and took 
little walk about the room. 

"i am glad, dr. silence, if you will allow me to say so, that you are 
here," he said simply, "very glad indeed. and now i fear i have kept you 
both up very late," with a glance to include me, "for you must be tired, 
and ready for your beds. i have told you all there is to tell," he 
added, "and tomorrow you must feel perfectly free to take any steps you 
think necessary." 

the end was abrupt, yet natural, for there was nothing more to say, and 
neither of these men talk for mere talking's sake. 

out in the cold and chilly hall he lit our candle and took us upstairs. 
the house was at rest and still, every one asleep. we move softly. 
through the window on the stairs we saw the moonlight fall across 
the lawn, throw deep shadows. the near pine tree were just visible 
in the distance, a wall of impenetrable blackness. 

our host came for a moment to our rooms to see that we had everything. 
he pointed to a coil of strong rope lie beside the window, fasten to 
the wall by means of an iron ring. evidently it had been recently put 
in. 

"i don't think we shall need it," dr. silence said, with a smile. 

"i trust not," reply our host gravely. "i sleep quite close to you 
across the landing," he whispered, point to his door, "and if you--if 
you want anything in the night you will know where to find me." 

he wish us pleasant dream and disappear down the passage into his 
room, shading the candle with his big muscular hand from the draughts. 

john silence stop me a moment before i went. 

"you know what it is?" i asked, with an excitement that even overcame my 
weariness. 

"yes," he said, "i'm almost sure. and you?" 

"not the smallest notion." 

he look disappointed, but not half as disappointed as i felt. 

"egypt," he whispered, "egypt!" 


ii 

nothing happen to disturb me in the night--nothing, that is, except a 
nightmare in which colonel wragge chase me amid thin streak of fire, 
and his sister always prevent my escape by sudden rising up out of 
the ground in her chair--dead. the deep bay of dogs woke me once, 
just before the dawn, it must have been, for i saw the window frame 
against the sky; there was a flash of lightning, too, i thought, as i 
turn over in bed. and it was warm, for october oppressive warm. 

it was after eleven o'clock when our host suggest go out with the 
guns, these, we understood, being a somewhat thin disguise for our true 
purpose. personally, i was glad to be in the open air, for the 
atmosphere of the house was heavy with presentiment. the sense of 
impending disaster hung over all. fear stalk the passages, and lurk 
in the corner of every room. it was a house haunted, but really 
haunted; not by some vague shadow of the dead, but by a definite though 
incalculable influence that was active alive, and dangerous. at the 
least smell of smoke the entire household quivered. an odour of burning, 
i was convinced, would paralyse all the inmates. for the servants, 
though professedly ignorant by the master's unspoken orders, yet share 
the common dread; and the hideous uncertainty, join with this display 
of so spiteful and calculate a spirit of malignity, provided a kind of 
black doom that drape not only the walls, but also the mind of the 
people living within them. 

only the bright and cheerful vision of old miss wragge being pushed 
about the house in her noiseless chair, chat and nod brisk to 
every one she met, prevent us from give way entire to the 
depression which govern the majority. the sight of her was like a 
gleam of sunshine through the depths of some ill-omened wood, and just 
as we went out i saw her being wheel along by her attendant into the 
sunshine of the back lawn, and caught her cheery smile as she turn her 
head and wish us good sport. 

the morning was october at its best. sunshine glisten on the 
dew-drenched grass and on leaves turn golden-red. the dainty 
messenger of coming hoar-frost were already in the air, a search for 
permanent winter quarters. from the wide moor that everywhere swept up 
against the sky, like a purple sea splash by the occasional grey of 
rocky clefts, there stole down the cool and perfume wind of the west. 
and the keen taste of the sea ran through all like a master-flavour, 
borne over the space perhaps by the seagull that cry and circle 
high in the air. 

but our host took little interest in this sparkle beauty, and had no 
thought of showing off the scenery of his property. his mind was 
otherwise intent, and, for that matter, so were our own. 

"those bleak moor and hill stretch unbroken for hours," he said, with 
a sweep of the hand; "and over there, some four miles," point in 
another direction, "lies s---- bay, a long, swampy inlet of the sea, 
haunt by myriad of seabirds. on the other side of the house are the 
plantation and pine-woods. i thought we would get the dogs and go first 
to the twelve acre wood i told you about last night. it's quite near." 

we found the dogs in the stable, and i recall the deep bay of the 
night when a fine bloodhound and two great dane leap out to greet us. 
singular companion for guns, i thought to myself, as we struck out 
across the field and the great creature bound and ran beside us, 
nose to ground. 

the conversation was scanty. john silence's grave face did not encourage 
talk. he wore the expression i knew well--that look of earnest 
solicitude which meant that his whole being was deep absorb and 
preoccupied. frightened, i had never seen him, but anxious often--it 
always move me to witness it--and he was anxious now. 

"on the way back you shall see the laundry building," colonel wragge 
observe shortly, for he, too, found little to say. "we shall attract 
less attention then." 

yet not all the crisp beauty of the morning seem able to dispel the 
feelings of uneasy dread that gather increasingly about our mind as 
we went. 

in a very few minutes a clump of pine tree conceal the house from 
view, and we found ourselves on the outskirts of a dense grown 
plantation of conifers. colonel wragge stop abruptly, and, produce 
a map from his pocket, explain once more very brief its position 
with regard to the house. he show how it ran up almost to the wall 
of the laundry building--though at the moment beyond our actual 
view--and pointed to the window of his sister's bedroom where the fire 
had been. the room, now empty, look straight on to the wood. then, 
glancing nervous about him, and calling the dogs to heel, he propose 
that we should enter the plantation and make as thorough examination of 
it as we thought worth while. the dogs, he added, might perhaps be 
persuade to accompany us a little way--and he pointed to where they 
cower at his feet--but he doubt it. "neither voice nor whip will get 
them very far, i'm afraid," he said. "i know by experience." 

"if you have no objection," reply dr. silence, with decision, and 
speak almost for the first time, "we will make our examination 
alone--mr. hubbard and myself. it will be best so." 

his tone was absolutely final, and the colonel acquiesce so polite 
that even a less intuitive man than myself must have seen that he was 
genuine relieved. 

"you doubtless have good reasons," he said. 

"merely that i wish to obtain my impression uncoloured. this delicate 
clue i am working on might be so easily blur by the thought-currents 
of another mind with strong preconceived ideas." 

"perfectly. i understand," rejoin the soldier, though with an 
expression of countenance that plainly contradict his words. "then i 
will wait here with the dogs; and we'll have a look at the laundry on 
our way home." 

i turn once to look back as we clamber over the low stone wall built 
by the late owner, and saw his straight, soldierly figure standing in 
the sunlit field watch us with a curious intent look on his face. 
there was something to me incongruous, yet distinct pathetic, in the 
man's effort to meet all far-fetched explanation of the mystery with 
contempt, and at the same time in his stolid, unswerving investigate 
of it all. he nod at me and made a gesture of farewell with his hand. 
that picture of him, standing in the sunshine with his big dogs, 
steady watch us, remains with me to this day. 

dr. silence led the way in among the twist trunks, plant close 
together in serried ranks, and i follow sharp at his heels. the moment 
we were out of sight he turn and put down his gun against the roots of 
a big tree, and i did likewise. 

"we shall hardly want these cumbersome weapon of murder," he observed, 
with a passing smile. 

"you are sure of your clue, then?" i ask at once, burst with 
curiosity, yet fear to betray it lest he should think me unworthy. 
his own method were so absolutely simple and untheatrical. 

"i am sure of my clue," he answer gravely. "and i think we have come 
just in time. you shall know in due course. for the present--be content 
to follow and observe. and think, steadily. the support of your mind 
will help me." 

his voice had that quiet mastery in it which leads men to face death 
with a sort of happiness and pride. i would have follow him anywhere 
at that moment. at the same time his words convey a sense of dread 
seriousness. i caught the thrill of his confidence; but also, in this 
broad light of day, i felt the measure of alarm that lay behind. 

"you still have no strong impressions?" he asked. "nothing happen in 
the night, for instance? no vivid dreamings?" 

he look close for my answer, i was aware. 

"i slept almost an unbroken sleep. i was tremendous tired, you know, 
and, but for the oppressive heat--" 

"good! you still notice the heat, then," he said to himself, rather than 
expect an answer. "and the lightning?" he added, "that lightning out 
of a clear sky--that flashing--did you notice _that_?" 

i answer truly that i thought i had seen a flash during a moment of 
wakefulness, and he then drew my attention to certain fact before 
moving on. 

"you remember the sensation of warmth when you put the letter to your 
forehead in the train; the heat generally in the house last evening, 
and, as you now mention, in the night. you heard, too, the colonel's 
story about the appearances of fire in this wood and in the house 
itself, and the way his brother and the gamekeeper came to their death 
twenty years ago." 

i nodded, wonder what in the world it all meant. 

"and you get no clue from these facts?" he asked, a trifle surprised. 

i search every corner of my mind and imagination for some inkling of 
his meaning, but was oblige to admit that i understood nothing so far. 

"never mind, you will later. and now," he added, "we will go over the 
wood and see what we can find." 

his words explain to me something of his method. we were to keep our 
mind alert and report to each other the least fancy that cross the 
picture-gallery of our thoughts. then, just as we started, he turn 
again to me with a final warning. 

"and, for your safety," he said earnestly, "imagine _now_--and for that 
matter, imagine always until we leave this place--imagine with the 
utmost keenness, that you are surround by a shell that protect you. 
picture yourself inside a protective envelope, and build it up with the 
most intense imagination you can evoke. pour the whole force of your 
thought and will into it. believe vivid all through this adventure 
that such a shell, construct of your thought, will and imagination, 
surround you completely, and that nothing can pierce it to attack." 

he spoke with dramatic conviction, gaze hard at me as though to 
enforce his meaning, and then move forward and began to pick his way 
over the rough, tussocky ground into the wood. and meanwhile, knowing 
the efficacy of his prescription, i adopt it to the best of my 
ability. 

the tree at once closed about us like the night. their branch met 
overhead in a continuous tangle, their stem crept close and closer, 
the bramble undergrowth thicken and multiplied. we tore our trousers, 
scratch our hands, and our eyes fill with fine dust that made it 
most difficult to avoid the clinging, prickly network of branch and 
creepers. coarse white grass that caught our feet like string grew here 
and there in patches. it crown the lump of peaty growth that stuck up 
like human heads, fantastic dressed, thrust up at us out of the 
ground with crest of dead hair. we stumble and flounder among them. 
it was hard going, and i could well conceive it impossible to find a way 
at all in the night-time. we jumped, when possible, from tussock to 
tussock, and it seem as though we were spring among head on a 
battlefield, and that this dead white grass conceal eyes that turn 
to stare as we passed. 

here and there the sunlight shot in with vivid spot of white light, 
dazzle the sight, but only making the surrounding gloom deep by 
contrast. and on two occasion we pass dark circular place in the 
grass where fire had eaten their mark and left a ring of ashes. dr. 
silence pointed to them, but without comment and without pausing, and 
the sight of them woke in me a singular realisation of the dread that 
lay so far only just out of sight in this adventure. 

it was exhaust work, and heavy going. we kept close together. the 
warmth, too, was extraordinary. yet it did not seem the warmth of the 
body due to violent exertion, but rather an inner heat of the mind that 
laid glowing hand of fire upon the heart and set the brain in a kind of 
steady blaze. when my companion found himself too far in advance, he 
wait for me to come up. the place had evidently been untouched by hand 
of man, keeper, forester or sportsman, for many a year; and my thoughts, 
as we advanced painfully, were not unlike the state of the wood 
itself--dark, confused, full of a haunting wonder and the shadow of 
fear. 

by this time all sign of the open field behind us were hid. no single 
gleam penetrated. we might have been grope in the heart of some 
primeval forest. then, suddenly, the bramble and tussock and 
stringlike grass came to an end; the tree open out; and the ground 
began to slope upwards towards a large central mound. we had reach the 
middle of the plantation, and before us stood the broken druid stone 
our host had mentioned. we walk easily up the little hill, between the 
sparse stems, and, rest upon one of the ivy-covered boulders, look 
round upon a comparatively open space, as large, perhaps, as a small 
london square. 

thinking of the ceremony and sacrifice this rough circle of 
prehistoric monolith might have witnessed, i look up into my 
companion's face with an unspoken question. but he read my thought and 
shook his head. 

"our mystery has nothing to do with these dead symbols," he said, "but 
with something perhaps even more ancient, and of another country 
altogether." 

"egypt?" i said half under my breath, hopeless puzzled, but recall 
his words in my bedroom. 

he nodded. mental i still floundered, but he seem intense 
preoccupied and it was no time for ask questions; so while his words 
circle unintelligib in my mind i look round at the scene before me, 
glad of the opportunity to recover breath and some measure of composure. 
but hardly had i time to notice the twist and contort shape of many 
of the pine tree close at hand when dr. silence lean over and touched 
me on the shoulder. he pointed down the slope. and the look i saw in his 
eyes key up every nerve in my body to its utmost pitch. 

a thin, almost imperceptible column of blue smoke was rising among the 
tree some twenty yard away at the foot of the mound. it curl up and 
up, and disappear from sight among the tangle branch overhead. it 
was scarcely thick than the smoke from a small brand of burning wood. 

"protect yourself! imagine your shell strongly," whisper the doctor 
sharply, "and follow me closely." 

he rose at once and move swift down the slope towards the smoke, and 
i followed, afraid to remain alone. i heard the soft crunch of our 
steps on the pine needles. over his shoulder i watch the thin blue 
spiral, without once taking my eyes off it. i hardly know how to 
describe the peculiar sense of vague horror inspired in me by the sight 
of that streak of smoke pencil its way upwards among the dark trees. 
and the sensation of increase heat as we approach was phenomenal. it 
was like walking towards a glowing yet invisible fire. 

as we drew near his pace slackened. then he stop and pointed, and i 
saw a small circle of burnt grass upon the ground. the tussock were 
blacken and smouldering, and from the centre rose this line of smoke, 
pale, blue, steady. then i notice a movement of the atmosphere beside 
us, as if the warm air were rising and the cooler air rush in to take 
its place: a little centre of wind in the stillness. overhead the bough 
stir and tremble where the smoke disappeared. otherwise, not a tree 
sighed, not a sound made itself heard. the wood was still as a 
graveyard. a horrible idea came to me that the course of nature was 
about to change without warning, had change a little already, that the 
sky would drop, or the surface of the earth crash inwards like a broken 
bubble. something, certainly, reach up to the citadel of my reason, 
cause its throne to shake. 

john silence move forward again. i could not see his face, but his 
attitude was plainly one of resolution, of muscle and mind ready for 
vigorous action. we were within ten feet of the blacken circle when 
the smoke of a sudden cease to rise, and vanished. the tail of the 
column disappear in the air above, and at the same instant it seem 
to me that the sensation of heat pass from my face, and the motion of 
the wind was gone. the calm spirit of the fresh october day resume 
command. 

side by side we advanced and examine the place. the grass was 
smouldering, the ground still hot. the circle of burn earth was a foot 
to a foot and a half in diameter. it look like an ordinary picnic 
fireplace. i bent down cautious to look, but in a second i sprang back 
with an involuntary cry of alarm, for, as the doctor stamp on the 
ashes to prevent them spreading, a sound of hiss rose from the spot 
as though he had kick a living creature. this hiss was faint 
audible in the air. it move past us, away towards the thick portion 
of the wood in the direction of our field, and in a second dr. silence 
had left the fire and start in pursuit. 

and then began the most extraordinary hunt of invisible i can ever 
conceive. 

he went fast even at the beginning, and, of course, it was perfectly 
obvious that he was following something. to judge by the poise of his 
head he kept his eyes steady at a certain level--just above the height 
of a man--and the consequence was he stumble a good deal over the 
roughness of the ground. the hiss sound had stopped. there was no 
sound of any kind, and what he saw to follow was utterly beyond me. i 
only know, that in mortal dread of being left behind, and with a biting 
curiosity to see whatever there was to be seen, i follow as quick as 
i could, and even then barely succeed in keeping up with him. 

and, as we went, the whole mad jumble of the colonel's story ran 
through my brain, touching a sense of frightened laughter that was only 
held in check by the sight of this earnest, hurry figure before me. 
for john silence at work inspired me with a kind of awe. he look so 
diminutive among these giant twist trees, while yet i knew that his 
purpose and his knowledge were so great, and even in hurry he was 
dignified. the fancy that we were play some queer, exaggerate game 
together met the fact that we were two men dance upon the brink of 
some possible tragedy, and the mingle of the two emotion in my mind 
was both grotesque and terrifying. 

he never turn in his mad chase, but pushed rapid on, while i pant 
after him like a figure in some unreasoning nightmare. and, as i ran, it 
came upon me that he had been aware all the time, in his quiet, internal 
way, of many things that he had kept for his own secret consideration; 
he had been watching, waiting, plan from the very moment we enter 
the shade of the wood. by some inner, concentrated process of mind, 
dynamic if not actually magical, he had been in direct contact with the 
source of the whole adventure, the very essence of the real mystery. and 
now the forces were moving to a climax. something was about to happen, 
something important, something possibly dreadful. every nerve, every 
sense, every significant gesture of the plunge figure before me 
proclaim the fact just as surely as the skies, the winds, and the face 
of the earth tell the bird the time to migrate and warn the animal 
that danger lurk and they must move. 

in a few moments we reach the foot of the mound and enter the 
tangle undergrowth that lay between us and the sunlight of the field. 
here the difficulty of fast travel increase a hundredfold. there 
were bramble to dodge, low bough to dive under, and countless tree 
trunks close up to make a direct path impossible. yet dr. silence 
never seem to falter or hesitate. he went, diving, jumping, dodging, 
ducking, but ever in the same main direction, following a clean trail. 
twice i trip and fell, and both times, when i picked myself up again, 
i saw him ahead of me, still force a way like a dog after its quarry. 
and sometimes, like a dog, he stop and pointed--human point it 
was, psychic pointing, and each time he stop to point i heard that 
faint high hiss in the air beyond us. the instinct of an infallible 
dowse possessed him, and he made no mistakes. 

at length, abruptly, i caught up with him, and found that we stood at 
the edge of the shallow pond colonel wragge had mention in his account 
the night before. it was long and narrow, fill with dark brown water, 
in which the tree were dim reflected. not a ripple stir its 
surface. 

"watch!" he cry out, as i came up. "it's go to cross. it's bound 
to betray itself. the water is its natural enemy, and we shall see the 
direction." 

and, even as he spoke, a thin line like the track of a water-spider, 
shot swift across the shiny surface; there was a ghost of steam in the 
air above; and immediately i became aware of an odour of burning. 

dr. silence turn and shot a glance at me that made me think of 
lightning. i began to shake all over. 

"quick!" he cry with excitement, "to the trail again! we must run 
around. it's go to the house!" 

the alarm in his voice quite terrify me. without a false step i dashed 
round the slippery bank and dive again at his heel into the sea of 
bush and tree trunks. we were now in the thick of the very dense belt 
that ran around the outer edge of the plantation, and the field was 
near; yet so dark was the tangle that it was some time before the first 
shaft of white sunlight became visible. the doctor now ran in zigzags. 
he was following something that dodge and double quite wonderfully, 
yet had begun, i fancied, to move more slow than before. 

"quick!" he cried. "in the light we shall lose it!" 

i still saw nothing, heard nothing, caught no suggestion of a trail; yet 
this man, guide by some interior divine that seem infallible, made 
no false turns, though how he fail to crash headlong into the tree 
has remain a mystery to me ever since. and then, with a sudden rush, 
we found ourselves on the skirt of the wood with the open field lie 
in bright sunshine before our eyes. 

"too late!" i heard him cry, a note of anguish in his voice. "it's 
out--and, by god, it's making for the house!" 

i saw the colonel standing in the field with his dogs where we had left 
him. he was bend double, peer into the wood where he heard us 
running, and he straighten up like a bent whip released. john silence 
dashed passed, calling him to follow. 

"we shall lose the trail in the light," i heard him cry as he ran. "but 
quick! we may yet get there in time!" 

that wild rush across the open field, with the dogs at our heels, 
leap and barking, and the elderly colonel behind us running as though 
for his life, shall i ever forget it? though i had only vague idea of 
the meaning of it all, i put my best foot forward, and, being the 
youngest of the three, i reach the house an easy first. i drew up, 
panting, and turn to wait for the others. but, as i turned, something 
moving a little distance away caught my eye, and in that moment i swear 
i experienced the most overwhelming and singular shock of surprise and 
terror i have ever known, or can conceive as possible. 

for the front door was open, and the waist of the house being narrow, i 
could see through the hall into the dining-room beyond, and so out on to 
the back lawn, and there i saw no less a sight than the figure of miss 
wragge--running. even at that distance it was plain that she had seen 
me, and was coming fast towards me, running with the frantic gait of a 
terror-stricken woman. she had recover the use of her legs. 

her face was a livid grey, as of death itself, but the general 
expression was one of laughter, for her mouth was gaping, and her eyes, 
always bright, shone with the light of a wild merriment that seem the 
merriment of a child, yet was singularly ghastly. and that very second, 
as she flee past me into her brother's arms behind, i smelt again most 
unmistakable the odour of burning, and to this day the smell of smoke 
and fire can come very near to turning me sick with the memory of what i 
had seen. 

fast on her heels, too, came the terrify attendant, more mistress of 
herself, and able to speak--which the old lady could not do--but with a 
face almost, if not quite, as fearful. 

"we were down by the bush in the sun,"--she gasp and scream in 
reply to colonel wragge's distracted questionings,--"i was wheeling the 
chair as usual when she shriek and leaped--i don't know exactly--i was 
too frightened to see--oh, my god! she jump clean out of the 
chair--_and ran_! there was a blast of hot air from the wood, and she 
hid her face and jumped. she didn't make a sound--she didn't cry out, or 
make a sound. she just ran." 

but the nightmare horror of it all reach the break point a few 
minutes later, and while i was still standing in the hall temporary 
bereft of speech and movement; for while the doctor, the colonel and the 
attendant were half-way up the staircase, helping the faint woman to 
the privacy of her room, and all in a confuse group of dark figures, 
there sound a voice behind me, and i turn to see the butler, his 
face dripping with perspiration, his eyes start out of his head. 

"the laundry's on fire!" he cried; "the laundry building's a-caught!" 

i remember his odd expression "a-caught," and wanting to laugh, but 
finding my face rigid and inflexible. 

"the devil's about again, s'help me gawd!" he cried, in a voice thin 
with terror, running about in circles. 

and then the group on the stairs scattered as at the sound of a shot, 
and the colonel and dr. silence came down three steps at a time, leave 
the afflict miss wragge to the care of her single attendant. 

we were out across the front lawn in a moment and round the corner of 
the house, the colonel leading, silence and i at his heels, and the 
portly butler puff some distance in the rear, get more and more 
mixed in his address to god and the devil; and the moment we pass 
the stable and came into view of the laundry building, we saw a 
wicked-looking volume of smoke pour out of the narrow windows, and 
the frightened women-servants and groom running hither and thither, 
calling aloud as they ran. 

the arrival of the master restore order instantly, and this retired 
soldier, poor think perhaps, but capable man of action, had the matter 
in hand from the start. he issue orders like a martinet, and, almost 
before i could realise it, there were stream bucket on the scene and 
a line of men and women form between the building and the stable pump. 

"inside," i heard john silence cry, and the colonel follow him through 
the door, while i was just quick enough at their heel to hear him add, 
"the smoke's the worst part of it. there's no fire yet, i think." 

and, true enough, there was no fire. the interior was thick with smoke, 
but it speedy clear and not a single bucket was use upon the floor 
or walls. the air was stifling, the heat fearful. 

"there's precious little to burn in here; it's all stone," the colonel 
exclaimed, coughing. but the doctor was point to the wooden cover of 
the great cauldron in which the clothes were washed, and we saw that 
these were smoulder and charred. and when we sprinkle half a bucket 
of water on them the surrounding brick hiss and fizz and sent up 
cloud of steam. through the open door and window this pass out with 
the rest of the smoke, and we three stood there on the brick floor 
staring at the spot and wondering, each in our own fashion, how in the 
name of natural law the place could have caught fire or smoke at all. 
and each was silent--myself from sheer incapacity and befuddlement, the 
colonel from the quiet pluck that face all things yet speak little, 
and john silence from the intense mental grapple with this latest 
manifestation of a profound problem that call for concentration of 
thought rather than for any words. 

there was really nothing to say. the fact were indisputable. 

colonel wragge was the first to utter. 

"my sister," he said briefly, and move off. in the yard i heard him 
send the frightened servant about their business in an excellent 
matter-of-fact voice, scold some one roundly for making such a big 
fire and letting the flue get over-heated, and pay no heed to the 
stammer reply that no fire had been lit there for several days. then 
he dispatch a groom on horseback for the local doctor. 

then dr. silence turn and look at me. the absolute control he 
possessed, not only over the outward expression of emotion by gesture, 
change of colour, light in the eyes, and so forth, but also, as i well 
knew, over its very birth in his heart, the masklike face of the dead he 
could assume at will, made it extremely difficult to know at any given 
moment what was at work in his inner consciousness. but now, when he 
turn and look at me, there was no sphinx-expression there, but 
rather the keen triumphant face of a man who had solve a dangerous and 
complicated problem, and saw his way to a clean victory. 

"_now_ do you guess?" he ask quietly, as though it were the simplest 
matter in the world, and ignorance were impossible. 

i could only stare stupid and remain silent. he glance down at the 
char cauldron-lids, and trace a figure in the air with his finger. 
but i was too excited, or too mortified, or still too dazed, perhaps, to 
see what it was he outlined, or what it was he meant to convey. i could 
only go on staring and shake my puzzle head. 

"a fire-elemental," he cried, "a fire-elemental of the most powerful and 
malignant kind--" 

"a what?" thunder the voice of colonel wragge behind us, have 
return sudden and overheard. 

"it's a fire-elemental," repeated dr. silence more calmly, but with a 
note of triumph in his voice he could not keep out, "and a 
fire-elemental enraged." 

the light began to dawn in my mind at last. but the colonel--who had 
never heard the term before, and was besides feeling considerably work 
up for a plain man with all this mystery he knew not how to grapple 
with--the colonel stood, with the most dumfoundere look ever seen on a 
human countenance, and continue to roar, and stammer, and stare. 

"and why," he began, savage with the desire to find something visible he 
could fight--"why, in the name of all the blazes--?" and then stop as 
john silence move up and took his arm. 

"there, my dear colonel wragge," he said gently, "you touch the heart of 
the whole thing. you ask 'why.' that is precisely our problem." he held 
the soldier's eyes firm with his own. "and that, too, i think, we 
shall soon know. come and let us talk over a plan of action--that room 
with the double doors, perhaps." 

the word "action" calm him a little, and he led the way, without 
further speech, back into the house, and down the long stone passage to 
the room where we had heard his story on the night of our arrival. i 
understood from the doctor's glance that my presence would not make the 
interview easy for our host, and i went upstairs to my own 
room--shaking. 

but in the solitude of my room the vivid memory of the last hour 
revive so merciless that i began to feel i should never in my whole 
life lose the dreadful picture of miss wragge running--that dreadful 
human climax after all the non-human mystery in the wood--and i was not 
sorry when a servant knock at my door and said that colonel wragge 
would be glad if i would join them in the little smoking-room. 

"i think it is better you should be present," was all colonel wragge 
said as i enter the room. i took the chair with my back to the window. 
there was still an hour before lunch, though i imagine that the usual 
division of the day hardly found a place in the thought of any one of 
us. 

the atmosphere of the room was what i might call electric. the colonel 
was positively bristling; he stood with his back to the fire, fingering 
an unlit black cigar, his face flushed, his being obviously rouse and 
ready for action. he hate this mystery. it was poisonous to his nature, 
and he long to meet something face to face--something he could gauge 
and fight. dr. silence, i notice at once, was sitting before the map of 
the estate which was spread upon a table. i knew by his expression the 
state of his mind. he was in the thick of it all, knew it, delight in 
it, and was working at high pressure. he recognise my presence with a 
lift eyelid, and the flash of the eye, contrast with his still 
and composure, told me volumes. 

"i was about to explain to our host brief what seem to me afoot in 
all this business," he said without look up, "when he ask that you 
should join us so that we can all work together." and, while signify 
my assent, i caught myself wonder what quality it was in the calm 
speech of this undemonstrative man that was so full of power, so charged 
with the strange, virile personality behind it and that seem to 
inspire us with his own confidence as by a process of radiation. 

"mr. hubbard," he went on gravely, turning to the soldier, "knows 
something of my methods, and in more than one--er--interesting situation 
has prove of assistance. what we want now"--and here he sudden got up 
and took his place on the mat beside the colonel, and look hard at 
him--"is men who have self-control, who are sure of themselves, whose 
mind at the critical moment will emit positive forces, instead of the 
waver and uncertain current due to negative feelings--due, for 
instance, to fear." 

he look at us each in turn. colonel wragge move his feet farther 
apart, and square his shoulders; and i felt guilty but said nothing, 
conscious that my latent store of courage was being deliberate haul 
to the front. he was winding me up like a clock. 

"so that, in what is yet to come," continue our leader, "each of us 
will contribute his share of power, and ensure success for my plan." 

"i'm not afraid of anything i can _see_," said the colonel bluntly. 

"i'm ready," i heard myself say, as it were automatically, "for 
anything," and then added, feeling the declaration was lame 
insufficient, "and everything." 

dr. silence left the mat and began walking to and fro about the room, 
both hand plunge deep into the pocket of his shooting-jacket. 
tremendous vitality stream from him. i never took my eyes off the 
small, moving figure; small yes,--and yet somehow making me think of a 
giant plot the destruction of worlds. and his manner was gentle, as 
always, soothe almost, and his words utter quiet without emphasis 
or emotion. most of what he said was addressed, though not too 
obviously, to the colonel. 

"the violence of this sudden attack," he said softly, pace to and fro 
beneath the bookcase at the end of the room, "is due, of course, partly 
to the fact that tonight the moon is at the full"--here he glance at me 
for a moment--"and partly to the fact that we have all been so 
deliberate concentrate upon the matter. our thinking, our 
investigation, has stir it into unusual activity. i mean that the 
intelligent force behind these manifestation has realise that some one 
is busy about its destruction. and it is now on the defensive: more, 
it is aggressive." 

"but 'it'--what is 'it'?" began the soldier, fuming. "what, in the name 
of all that's dreadful, _is_ a fire-elemental?" 

"i cannot give you at this moment," reply dr. silence, turning to him, 
but undisturbed by the interruption, "a lecture on the nature and 
history of magic, but can only say that an elemental is the active force 
behind the elements,--whether earth, air, water, _or fire_,--it is 
impersonal in its essential nature, but can be focused, personified, 
ensouled, so to say, by those who know how--by magicians, if you 
will--for certain purpose of their own, much in the same way that steam 
and electricity can be harness by the practical man of this century. 

"alone, these blind elemental energy can accomplish little, but 
govern and direct by the train will of a powerful manipulate they 
may become potent activity for good or evil. they are the basis of all 
magic, and it is the motive behind them that constitute the magic 
'black' or 'white'; they can be the vehicle of curse or of blessings, 
for a curse is nothing more than the thought of a violent will 
perpetuated. and in such cases--cases like this--the conscious, 
direct will of the mind that is use the elemental stand always 
behind the phenomena--" 

"you think that my brother--!" broke in the colonel, aghast. 

"has nothing whatever to do with it--directly. the fire-elemental that 
has here been torment you and your household was sent upon its 
mission long before you, or your family, or your ancestors, or even the 
nation you belong to--unless i am much mistaken--was even in existence. 
we will come to that a little later; after the experiment i propose to 
make we shall be more positive. at present i can only say we have to 
deal now, not only with the phenomenon of attack fire merely, but 
with the vindictive and enrage intelligence that is direct it from 
behind the scenes--vindictive and enraged,"--he repeated the words. 

"that explains--" began colonel wragge, seek furiously for words he 
could not find quick enough. 

"much," said john silence, with a gesture to restrain him. 

he stop a moment in the middle of his walk, and a deep silence came 
down over the little room. through the window the sunlight seem less 
bright, the long line of dark hill less friendly, making me think of a 
vast wave towering to heaven and about to break and overwhelm us. 
something formidable had crept into the world about us. for, 
undoubtedly, there was a disquiet thought, holding terror as well as 
awe, in the picture his words conjure up: the conception of a human 
will reach its deathless hand, spiteful and destructive, down through 
the ages, to strike the living and afflict the innocent. 

"but what is its object?" burst out the soldier, unable to restrain 
himself long in the silence. "why do it come from that plantation? 
and why should it attack us, or any one in particular?" question began 
to pour from him in a stream. 

"all in good time," the doctor answer quietly, have let him run on 
for several minutes. "but i must first discover positively what, or who, 
it is that direct this particular fire-elemental. and, to do that, we 
must first"--he spoke with slow deliberation--"seek to capture--to 
confine by visibility--to limit its sphere in a concrete form." 

"good heaven almighty!" exclaim the soldier, mix his words in his 
unfeigned surprise. 

"quite so," pursue the other calmly; "for in so do i think we can 
release it from the purpose that bind it, restore it to its normal 
condition of latent fire, and also"--he lower his voice perceptible 
--"also discover the face and form of the being that ensoul it." 

"the man behind the gun!" cry the colonel, beginning to understand 
something, and leaning forward so as not to miss a single syllable. 

"i mean that in the last resort, before it returns to the womb of 
potential fire, it will probably assume the face and figure of its 
director, of the man of magical knowledge who originally bound it with 
his incantation and sent it forth upon its mission of centuries." 

the soldier sat down and gasp openly in his face, breathing hard; but 
it was a very subdued voice that frame the question. 

"and how do you propose to make it visible? how capture and confine it? 
what d'ye mean, dr. john silence?" 

"by furnish it with the material for a form. by the process of 
materialise simply. once limited by dimensions, it will become slow, 
heavy, visible. we can then dissipate it. invisible fire, you see, is 
dangerous and incalculable; lock up in a form we can perhaps manage 
it. we must betray it--to its death." 

"and this material?" we ask in the same breath, although i think i had 
already guessed. 

"not pleasant, but effective," came the quiet reply; "the exhalation of 
freshly spill blood." 

"not human blood!" cry colonel wragge, start up from his chair with 
a voice like an explosion. i thought his eyes would start from their 
sockets. 

the face of dr. silence relax in spite of himself, and his spontaneous 
little laugh brought a welcome though momentary relief. 

"the days of human sacrifice, i hope, will never come again," he 
explained. "animal blood will answer the purpose, and we can make the 
experiment as pleasant as possible. only, the blood must be freshly 
spill and strong with the vital emanate that attract this peculiar 
class of elemental creature. perhaps--perhaps if some pig on the estate 
is ready for the market--" 

he turn to hide a smile; but the passing touch of comedy found no echo 
in the mind of our host, who did not understand how to change quick 
from one emotion to another. clearly he was debate many things 
laborious in his honest brain. but, in the end, the earnest and 
scientific disinterested of the doctor, whose influence over him was 
already very great, won the day, and he presently look up more calmly, 
and observe shortly that he thought perhaps the matter could be 
arranged. 

"there are other and pleasant methods," dr. silence went on to 
explain, "but they require time and preparation, and things have gone 
much too far, in my opinion, to admit of delay. and the process need 
cause you no distress: we sit round the bowl and await results. nothing 
more. the emanate of blood--which, as levi says, is the first 
incarnation of the universal fluid--furnish the material out of which 
the creature of discarnate life, spirits if you prefer, can fashion 
themselves a temporary appearance. the process is old, and lie at the 
root of all blood sacrifice. it was known to the priest of baal, and it 
is known to the modern ecstasy dance who cut themselves to produce 
objective phantom who dance with them. and the least gifted clairvoyant 
could tell you that the form to be seen in the vicinity of 
slaughter-houses, or hover above the desert battlefields, 
are--well, simply beyond all description. i do not mean," he added, 
notice the uneasy fidget of his host, "that anything in our 
laundry-experiment need appear to terrify us, for this case seem a 
comparatively simple one, and it is only the vindictive character of the 
intelligence direct this fire-elemental that cause anxiety and make 
for personal danger." 

"it is curious," said the colonel, with a sudden rush of words, drawing 
a deep breath, and as though speak of things distasteful to him, 
"that during my years among the hill tribe of northern india i came 
across--personally came across--instances of the sacrifice of blood to 
certain deity being stop suddenly, and all manner of disaster 
happening until they were resumed. fire broke out in the huts, and even 
on the clothes, of the natives--and--and i admit i have read, in the 
course of my studies,"--he made a gesture toward his books and heavy 
laden table,--"of the yezidi of syria evoke phantom by means of 
cutting their body with knives during their whirl dances--enormous 
globe of fire which turn into monstrous and terrible forms--and i 
remember an account somewhere, too, how the emaciate form and pallid 
countenance of the spectres, that appear to the emperor julian, 
claim to be the true immortals, and told him to renew the sacrifice 
of blood 'for the fumes of which, since the establishment of 
christianity, they had been pining'--that these were in reality the 
phantom evoke by the rite of blood." 

both dr. silence and myself listen in amazement, for this sudden 
speech was so unexpected, and betray so much more knowledge than we 
had either of us suspect in the old soldier. 

"then perhaps you have read, too," said the doctor, "how the cosmic 
deity of savage races, elemental in their nature, have been kept alive 
through many age by these blood rites?" 

"no," he answered; "that is new to me." 

"in any case," dr. silence added, "i am glad you are not wholly 
unfamiliar with the subject, for you will now bring more sympathy, and 
therefore more help, to our experiment. for, of course, in this case, we 
only want the blood to tempt the creature from its lair and enclose it 
in a form--" 

"i quite understand. and i only hesitate just now," he went on, his 
words coming much more slowly, as though he felt he had already said too 
much, "because i wish to be quite sure it was no mere curiosity, but 
an actual sense of necessity that dictate this horrible experiment." 

"it is your safety, and that of your household, and of your sister, that 
is at stake," reply the doctor. "once i have _seen_, i hope to 
discover whence this elemental comes, and what its real purpose is." 

colonel wragge signify his assent with a bow. 

"and the moon will help us," the other said, "for it will be full in the 
early hour of the morning, and this kind of elemental-being is always 
most active at the period of full moon. hence, you see, the clue 
furnish by your diary." 

so it was finally settled. colonel wragge would provide the material 
for the experiment, and we were to meet at midnight. how he would 
contrive at that hour--but that was his business. i only know we both 
realise that he would keep his word, and whether a pig die at 
midnight, or at noon, was after all perhaps only a question of the sleep 
and personal comfort of the executioner. 

"tonight, then, in the laundry," said dr. silence finally, to clinch the 
plan; "we three alone--and at midnight, when the household is asleep and 
we shall be free from disturbance." 

he exchange significant glance with our host, who, at that moment, was 
call away by the announcement that the family doctor had arrived, and 
was ready to see him in his sister's room. 

for the remainder of the afternoon john silence disappeared. i had my 
suspicion that he made a secret visit to the plantation and also to the 
laundry building; but, in any case, we saw nothing of him, and he kept 
strict to himself. he was prepare for the night, i felt sure, but 
the nature of his preparation i could only guess. there was movement in 
his room, i heard, and an odour like incense hung about the door, and 
knowing that he regard rite as the vehicle of energies, my guess 
were probably not far wrong. 

colonel wragge, too, remain absent the greater part of the afternoon, 
and, deep afflicted, had scarcely left his sister's bedside, but in 
response to my inquiry when we met for a moment at tea-time, he told me 
that although she had moments of attempt speech, her talk was quite 
incoherent and hysterical, and she was still quite unable to explain the 
nature of what she had seen. the doctor, he said, fear she had 
recover the use of her limbs, only to lose that of her memory, and 
perhaps even of her mind. 

"then the recovery of her legs, i trust, may be permanent, at any rate," 
i ventured, finding it difficult to know what sympathy to offer. and he 
reply with a curious short laugh, "oh yes; about that there can be no 
doubt whatever." 

and it was due merely to the chance of my overhear a fragment of 
conversation--unwillingly, of course--that a little further light was 
thrown upon the state in which the old lady actually lay. for, as i came 
out of my room, it happen that colonel wragge and the doctor were 
go downstairs together, and their words float up to my ear before 
i could make my presence known by so much as a cough. 

"then you must find a way," the doctor was saying with decision; "for i 
cannot insist too strong upon that--and at all costs she must be kept 
quiet. these attempt to go out must be prevented--if necessary, by 
force. this desire to visit some wood or other she keeps talk about 
is, of course, hysterical in nature. it cannot be permit for a 
moment." 

"it shall not be permitted," i heard the soldier reply, as they reach 
the hall below. 

"it has impress her mind for some reason--" the doctor went on, by way 
evidently of soothe explanation, and then the distance made it 
impossible for me to hear more. 

at dinner dr. silence was still absent, on the public plea of a 
headache, and though food was sent to his room, i am inclined to believe 
he did not touch it, but spent the entire time fasting. 

we retired early, desire that the household should do likewise, and i 
must confess that at ten o'clock when i bid my host a temporary 
good-night, and sought my room to make what mental preparation i could, 
i realise in no very pleasant fashion that it was a singular and 
formidable assignation, this midnight meeting in the laundry building, 
and that there were moments in every adventure of life when a wise man, 
and one who knew his own limitations, owe it to his dignity to withdraw 
discreetly. and, but for the character of our leader, i probably should 
have then and there offer the best excuse i could think of, and have 
allow myself quiet to fall asleep and wait for an exciting story in 
the morning of what had happened. but with a man like john silence, such 
a lapse was out of the question, and i sat before my fire count the 
minutes and do everything i could think of to fortify my resolution 
and fasten my will at the point where i could be reasonably sure that my 
self-control would hold against all attack of men, devils, or 
elementals. 


iii 

at a quarter before midnight, clad in a heavy ulster, and with slipper 
feet, i crept cautious from my room and stole down the passage to the 
top of the stairs. outside the doctor's door i wait a moment to 
listen. all was still; the house in utter darkness; no gleam of light 
beneath any door; only, down the length of the corridor, from the 
direction of the sick-room, came faint sound of laughter and incoherent 
talk that were not things to reassure a mind already half a-tremble, and 
i made haste to reach the hall and let myself out through the front 
door into the night. 

the air was keen and frosty, perfume with night smells, and exquisite 
fresh; all the million candle of the sky were alight, and a faint 
breeze rose and fell with far-away sigh in the tops of the pine 
trees. my blood leap for a moment in the spacious of the night, 
for the splendid stars brought courage; but the next instant, as i 
turn the corner of the house, moving stealthy down the gravel drive, 
my spirits sank again ominously. for, yonder, over the funereal plume 
of the twelve acre plantation, i saw the broken, yellow disc of the 
half-moon just rising in the east, staring down like some vast being 
come to watch upon the progress of our doom. seen through the distort 
vapours of the earth's atmosphere, her face look weird unfamiliar, 
her usual expression of benignant vacancy somehow a-twist. i slip 
along by the shadow of the wall, keeping my eyes upon the ground. 

the laundry-house, as already described, stood detached from the other 
offices, with laurel shrubbery crowd thick behind it, and the 
kitchen-garden so close on the other side that the strong smell of soil 
and grow things came across almost heavily. the shadow of the 
haunt plantation, hugely lengthen by the rising moon behind them, 
reach to the very wall and cover the stone tile of the roof with a 
dark pall. so keen were my senses alert at this moment that i believe 
i could fill a chapter with the endless small detail of the impression 
i received--shadows, odour, shapes, sounds--in the space of the few 
seconds i stood and wait before the closed wooden door. 

then i became aware of some one moving towards me through the moonlight, 
and the figure of john silence, without overcoat and bareheaded, came 
quick and without noise to join me. his eyes, i saw at once, were 
wonderful bright, and so marked was the shining pallor of his face 
that i could hardly tell when he pass from the moonlight into the 
shade. 

he pass without a word, beckon me to follow, and then pushed the 
door open, and went in. 

the chill air of the place met us like that of an underground vault; and 
the brick floor and whitewash walls, streak with damp and smoke, 
threw back the cold in our faces. directly opposite gape the black 
throat of the huge open fireplace, the ashes of wood fire still pile 
and scattered about the hearth, and on either side of the project 
chimney-column were the deep recess holding the big twin cauldron for 
boil clothes. upon the lid of these cauldron stood the two little 
oil lamps, shade red, which gave all the light there was, and 
immediately in front of the fireplace there was a small circular table 
with three chair set about it. overhead, the narrow slit windows, high 
up the walls, pointed to a dim network of wooden rafter half lost among 
the shadows, and then came the dark vault of the roof. cheerless and 
unalluring, for all the red light, it certainly was, remind me of 
some unused conventicle, bare of pew or pulpit, ugly and severe, and i 
was forcibly struck by the contrast between the normal use to which the 
place was ordinarily put, and the strange and medieval purpose which had 
brought us under its roof tonight. 

possibly an involuntary shudder ran over me, for my companion turn 
with a confident look to reassure me, and he was so completely master of 
himself that i at once absorb from his abundance, and felt the chink 
of my failing courage beginning to close up. to meet his eye in the 
presence of danger was like finding a mental railing that guide and 
support thought along the giddy edge of alarm. 

"i am quite ready," i whispered, turning to listen for approach 
footsteps. 

he nodded, still keeping his eyes on mine. our whisper sound hollow 
as they echo overhead among the rafters. 

"i'm glad you are here," he said. "not all would have the courage. keep 
your thought controlled, and imagine the protective shell round 
you--round your inner being." 

"i'm all right," i repeated, curse my chatter teeth. 

he took my hand and shook it, and the contact seem to shake into me 
something of his supreme confidence. the eyes and hand of a strong man 
can touch the soul. i think he guess my thought, for a passing smile 
flash about the corner of his mouth. 

"you will feel more comfortable," he said, in a low tone, "when the 
chain is complete. the colonel we can count on, of course. 
remember, though," he add warningly, "he may perhaps become 
controlled--possessed--when the thing comes, because he won't know how 
to resist. and to explain the business to such a man--!" he shrug 
his shoulder expressively. "but it will only be temporary, and i will 
see that no harm come to him." 

he glance round at the arrangement with approval. 

"red light," he said, indicate the shade lamps, "has the lowest rate 
of vibration. materialise are dissipated by strong light--won't 
form, or hold together--in rapid vibrations." 

i was not sure that i approve altogether of this dim light, for in 
complete dark there is something protective--the knowledge that one 
cannot be seen, probably--which a half-light destroys, but i remember 
the warning to keep my thought steady, and forbore to give them 
expression. 

there was a step outside, and the figure of colonel wragge stood in the 
doorway. though enter on tiptoe, he made considerable noise and 
clatter, for his free movements were impede by the burden he carried, 
and we saw a large yellowish bowl held out at arms' length from his 
body, the mouth cover with a white cloth. his face, i noted, was 
rigid composed. he, too, was master of himself. and, as i thought of 
this old soldier moving through the long series of alarms, worn with 
watch and weary with assault, unenlightened yet undismayed, even 
down to the dreadful shock of his sister's terror, and still showing the 
dogged pluck that persist in the face of defeat, i understood what dr. 
silence meant when he describe him as a man "to be count on." 

i think there was nothing beyond this rigidity of his stern features, 
and a certain grey of the complexion, to betray the turmoil of the 
emotion that were doubtless go on within; and the quality of these 
two men, each in his own way, so key me up that, by the time the door 
was shut and we had exchange silent greetings, all the latent courage i 
possessed was well to the fore, and i felt as sure of myself as i knew i 
ever could feel. 

colonel wragge set the bowl careful in the centre of the table. 

"midnight," he said shortly, glancing at his watch, and we all three 
move to our chairs. 

there, in the middle of that cold and silent place, we sat, with the 
vile bowl before us, and a thin, hardly perceptible steam rising through 
the damp air from the surface of the white cloth and disappear 
upwards the moment it pass beyond the zone of red light and enter 
the deep shadow thrown forward by the project wall of chimney. 

the doctor had indicate our respective places, and i found myself 
seat with my back to the door and opposite the black hearth. the 
colonel was on my left, and dr. silence on my right, both half facing 
me, the latter more in shadow than the former. we thus divide the 
little table into even sections, and sitting back in our chair we 
await event in silence. 

for something like an hour i do not think there was even the faintest 
sound within those four wall and under the canopy of that vaulted roof. 
our slipper made no scratch on the gritty floor, and our breathing 
was suppress almost to nothing; even the rustle of our clothes as we 
shift from time to time upon our seat was inaudible. silence 
smother us absolutely--the silence of night, of listening, the silence 
of a haunt expectancy. the very gurgle of the lamp was too soft to 
be heard, and if light itself had sound, i do not think we should have 
notice the silvery tread of the moonlight as it enter the high narrow 
window and threw upon the floor the slender trace of its pallid 
footsteps. 

colonel wragge and the doctor, and myself too for that matter, sat thus 
like figures of stone, without speech and without gesture. my eyes 
pass in ceaseless journey from the bowl to their faces, and from 
their face to the bowl. they might have been masks, however, for all 
the sign of life they gave; and the light steam from the horrid 
contents beneath the white cloth had long cease to be visible. 

then presently, as the moon rose higher, the wind rose with it. it 
sighed, like the lightest of passing wings, over the roof; it crept most 
soft round the walls; it made the brick floor like ice beneath our 
feet. with it i saw mental the desolate moorland flowing like a sea 
about the old house, the treeless expanse of lonely hills, the near 
copses, sombre and mysterious in the night. the plantation, too, in 
particular i saw, and imagine i heard the mournful whisper that 
must now be a-stirring among its tree-tops as the breeze play down 
between the twist stems. in the depth of the room behind us the shaft 
of moonlight met and cross in a grow network. 

it was after an hour of this wearing and unbroken attention, and i 
should judge about one o'clock in the morning, when the bay of the 
dogs in the stableyard first began, and i saw john silence move sudden 
in his chair and sit up in an attitude of attention. every force in my 
being instantly leap into the keenest vigilance. colonel wragge move 
too, though slowly, and without raise his eyes from the table before 
him. 

the doctor stretch his arm out and took the white cloth from the bowl. 

it was perhaps imagination that persuade me the red glare of the lamp 
grew faint and the air over the table before us thickened. i had been 
expect something for so long that the movement of my companions, and 
the lift of the cloth, may easily have cause the momentary delusion 
that something hover in the air before my face, touching the skin of 
my cheek with a silken run. but it was certainly not a delusion that 
the colonel look up at the same moment and glance over his shoulder, 
as though his eyes follow the movements of something to and fro about 
the room, and that he then button his overcoat more tight about him 
and his eyes sought my own face first, and then the doctor's. and it was 
no delusion that his face seem somehow to have turn dark, become 
spread as it were with a shadowy blackness. i saw his lip tighten and 
his expression grow hard and stern, and it came to me then with a rush 
that, of course, this man had told us but a part of the experience he 
had been through in the house, and that there was much more he had never 
been able to bring himself to reveal at all. i felt sure of it. the way 
he turn and stare about him betray a familiarity with other things 
than those he had describe to us. it was not merely a sight of fire he 
look for; it was a sight of something alive, intelligent, something 
able to evade his searching; it was _a person_. it was the watch for the 
ancient being who sought to obsess him. 

and the way in which dr. silence answer his look--though it was only 
by a glance of subtlest sympathy--confirmed my impression. 

"we may be ready now," i heard him say in a whisper, and i understood 
that his words were intended as a steady warning, and brace myself 
mental to the utmost of my power. 

yet long before colonel wragge had turn to stare about the room, and 
long before the doctor had confirmed my impression that things were at 
last beginning to stir, i had become aware in most singular fashion that 
the place held more than our three selves. with the rising of the wind 
this increase to our numbers had first taken place. the bay of the 
hound almost seem to have signal it. i cannot say how it may be 
possible to realise that an empty place has sudden become--not empty, 
when the new arrival is nothing that appeal to any one of the senses; 
for this recognition of an "invisible," as of the change in the balance 
of personal forces in a human group, is indefinable and beyond proof. 
yet it is unmistakable. and i knew perfectly well at what given moment 
the atmosphere within these four wall became charged with the presence 
of other living being besides ourselves. and, on reflection, i am 
convinced that both my companion knew it too. 

"watch the light," said the doctor under his breath, and then i knew too 
that it was no fancy of my own that had turn the air darker, and the 
way he turn to examine the face of our host sent an electric thrill of 
wonder and expectancy shiver along every nerve in my body. 

yet it was no kind of terror that i experienced, but rather a sort of 
mental dizziness, and a sensation as of being suspend in some remote 
and dreadful altitude where things might happen, indeed were about to 
happen, that had never before happen within the ken of man. horror may 
have form an ingredient, but it was not chiefly horror, and in no 
sense ghostly horror. 

uncommon thought kept beating on my brain like tiny hammers, soft yet 
persistent, seek admission; their unbidden tide began to wash along 
the far fringe of my mind, the current of unwonted sensation to rise 
over the remote frontier of my consciousness. i was aware of thoughts, 
and the fantasy of thoughts, that i never knew before existed. 
portion of my being stir that had never stir before, and things 
ancient and inexplicable rose to the surface and beckon me to follow. 
i felt as though i were about to fly off, at some immense tangent, into 
an outer space hitherto unknown even in dreams. and so singular was the 
result produce upon me that i was uncommonly glad to anchor my mind, as 
well as my eyes, upon the masterful personality of the doctor at my 
side, for there, i realised, i could draw always upon the forces of 
sanity and safety. 

with a vigorous effort of will i return to the scene before me, and 
try to focus my attention, with steady thoughts, upon the table, and 
upon the silent figures seat round it. and then i saw that certain 
change had come about in the place where we sat. 

the patch of moonlight on the floor, i noted, had become curious 
shaded; the face of my companion opposite were not so clearly visible 
as before; and the forehead and cheek of colonel wragge were glisten 
with perspiration. i realise further, that an extraordinary change had 
come about in the temperature of the atmosphere. the increase warmth 
had a painful effect, not alone on colonel wragge, but upon all of us. 
it was oppressive and unnatural. we gasp figurative as well as 
actually. 

"you are the first to feel it," said dr. silence in low tones, look 
across at him. "you are in more intimate touch, of course--" 

the colonel was trembling, and appear to be in considerable distress. 
his knee shook, so that the shuffle of his slipper feet became 
audible. he inclined his head to show that he had heard, but made no 
other reply. i think, even then, he was sore put to it to keep himself 
in hand. i knew what he was struggle against. as dr. silence had 
warn me, he was about to be obsessed, and was savagely, though vainly, 
resisting. 

but, meanwhile, a curious and whirl sense of exhilarate began to 
come over me. the increase heat was delightful, bring a sensation 
of intense activity, of thought pour through the mind at high speed, 
of vivid pictures in the brain, of fierce desire and lightning energy 
alive in every part of the body. i was conscious of no physical 
distress, such as the colonel felt, but only of a vague feeling that it 
might all grow sudden too intense--that i might be consumed--that my 
personality as well as my body, might become resolve into the flame of 
pure spirit. i began to live at a speed too intense to last. it was as 
if a thousand ecstasy besiege me-- 

"steady!" whisper the voice of john silence in my ear, and i look up 
with a start to see that the colonel had risen from his chair. the 
doctor rose too. i follow suit, and for the first time saw down into 
the bowl. to my amaze and horror i saw that the contents were 
troubled. the blood was astir with movement. 

the rest of the experiment was witness by us standing. it came, too, 
with a curious suddenness. there was no more dreaming, for me at any 
rate. 

i shall never forget the figure of colonel wragge standing there beside 
me, upright and unshaken, square plant on his feet, look about 
him, puzzle beyond belief, yet full of a fight anger. frame by the 
white walls, the red glow of the lamp upon his stream cheeks, his 
eyes glowing against the deathly pallor of his skin, breathing hard and 
making convulsive effort of hand and body to keep himself under 
control, his whole being rouse to the point of savage fighting, yet 
with nothing visible to get at anywhere--he stood there, immovable 
against odds. and the strange contrast of the pale skin and the burning 
face i had never seen before, or wish to see again. 

but what has left an even sharper impression on my memory was the 
black that then began crawl over his face, obliterate the 
features, conceal their human outline, and hiding him inch by inch 
from view. this was my first realisation that the process of 
materialise was at work. his visage became shrouded. i move from 
one side to the other to keep him in view, and it was only then i 
understood that, properly speaking, the black was not upon the 
countenance of colonel wragge, but that something had insert itself 
between me and him, thus screening his face with the effect of a dark 
veil. something that apparently rose through the floor was passing 
slow into the air above the table and above the bowl. the blood in the 
bowl, moreover, was considerably less than before. 

and, with this change in the air before us, there came at the same time 
a further change, i thought, in the face of the soldier. one-half was 
turn towards the red lamps, while the other caught the pale 
illumination of the moonlight fall aslant from the high windows, so 
that it was difficult to estimate this change with accuracy of detail. 
but it seem to me that, while the features--eyes, nose, 
mouth--remained the same, the life inform them had undergone some 
profound transformation. the signature of a new power had crept into the 
face and left its trace there--an expression dark, and in some 
unexplained way, terrible. 

then sudden he open his mouth and spoke, and the sound of this 
change voice, deep and musical though it was, made me cold and set my 
heart beating with uncomfortable rapidity. the being, as he had dreaded, 
was already in control of his brain, use his mouth. 

"i see a black like the black of egypt before my face," said 
the tone of this unknown voice that seem half his own and half 
another's. "and out of this dark they come, they come." 

i gave a dreadful start. the doctor turn to look at me for an instant, 
and then turn to centre his attention upon the figure of our host, and 
i understood in some intuitive fashion that he was there to watch over 
the strangest contest man ever saw--to watch over and, if necessary, to 
protect. 

"he is being controlled--possessed," he whisper to me through the 
shadows. his face wore a wonderful expression, half triumph, half 
admiration. 

even as colonel wragge spoke, it seem to me that this visible dark 
began to increase, pour up thick out of the ground by the hearth, 
rising up in sheet and veils, shroud our eyes and faces. it stole up 
from below--an awful black that seem to drink in all the 
radiation of light in the building, leave nothing but the ghost of a 
radiance in their place. then, out of this rising sea of shadows, issue 
a pale and spectral light that gradual spread itself about us, and 
from the heart of this light i saw the shape of fire crowd and gather. 
and these were not human shapes, or the shape of anything i recognise 
as alive in the world, but outline of fire that trace globes, 
triangles, crosses, and the luminous body of various geometric 
figures. they grew bright, faded, and then grew bright again with an 
effect almost of pulsation. they pass swift to and fro through the 
air, rising and falling, and particularly in the immediate neighbourhood 
of the colonel, often gathering about his head and shoulders, and even 
appear to settle upon him like giant insect of flame. they were 
accompanied, moreover, by a faint sound of hissing--the same sound we 
had heard that afternoon in the plantation. 

"the fire-elementals that precede their master," the doctor said in an 
undertone. "be ready." 

and while this weird display of the shape of fire alternate flash 
and faded, and the hiss echo faint among the dim rafter 
overhead, we heard the awful voice issue at interval from the lip of 
the afflict soldier. it was a voice of power, splendid in some way i 
cannot describe, and with a certain sense of majesty in its cadences, 
and, as i listen to it with quick beating heart, i could fancy it 
was some ancient voice of time itself, echo down immense corridor of 
stone, from the depths of vast temples, from the very heart of mountain 
tombs. 

"i have seen my divine father, osiris," thunder the great tones. "i 
have scattered the gloom of the night. i have burst through the earth, 
and am one with the starry deities!" 

something grand came into the soldier's face. he was staring fixedly 
before him, as though seeing nothing. 

"watch," whisper dr. silence in my ear, and his whisper seem to come 
from very far away. 

again the mouth open and the awesome voice issue forth. 

"thoth," it boomed, "has loosen the bandage of set which fetter my 
mouth. i have taken my place in the great wind of heaven." 

i heard the little wind of night, with its mournful voice of ages, 
sigh round the wall and over the roof. 

"listen!" came from the doctor at my side, and the thunder of the voice 
continued-- 

"i have hidden myself with you, o ye stars that never diminish. i 
remember my name--in--the--house--of--fire!" 

the voice cease and the sound die away. something about the face and 
figure of colonel wragge relaxed, i thought. the terrible look pass 
from his face. the being that obsess him was gone. 

"the great ritual," said dr. silence aside to me, very low, "the book of 
the dead. now it's leave him. soon the blood will fashion it a body." 

colonel wragge, who had stood absolutely motionless all this time, 
sudden swayed, so that i thought he was go to fall,--and, but for 
the quick support of the doctor's arm, he probably would have fallen, 
for he stagger as in the beginning of collapse. 

"i am drunk with the wine of osiris," he cried,--and it was half with 
his own voice this time--"but horus, the eternal watcher, is about my 
path--for--safety." the voice dwindle and failed, die away into 
something almost like a cry of distress. 

"now, watch closely," said dr. silence, speak loud, "for after the 
cry will come the fire!" 

i began to tremble involuntarily; an awful change had come without 
warning into the air; my leg grew weak as paper beneath my weight and i 
had to support myself by leaning on the table. colonel wragge, i saw, 
was also leaning forward with a kind of droop. the shape of fire had 
vanish all, but his face was lit by the red lamp and the pale, 
shift moonlight rose behind him like mist. 

we were both gaze at the bowl, now almost empty; the colonel stoop 
so low i fear every minute he would lose his balance and drop into it; 
and the shadow, that had so long been in process of forming, now at 
length began to assume material outline in the air before us. 

then john silence move forward quickly. he took his place between us 
and the shadow. erect, formidable, absolute master of the situation, i 
saw him stand there, his face calm and almost smiling, and fire in his 
eyes. his protective influence was astound and incalculable. even the 
abhorrent dread i felt at the sight of the creature grow into life 
and substance before us, lessen in some way so that i was able to keep 
my eyes fixed on the air above the bowl without too vivid a terror. 

but as it took shape, rising out of nothing as it were, and grow 
momentarily more define in outline, a period of utter and wonderful 
silence settled down upon the building and all it contained. a hush of 
ages, like the sudden centre of peace at the heart of the travel 
cyclone, descended through the night, and out of this hush, as out of 
the emanate of the steam blood, issue the form of the ancient 
being who had first sent the elemental of fire upon its mission. it grew 
and darken and solidify before our eyes. it rose from just beyond 
the table so that the lower portion remain invisible, but i saw the 
outline limn itself upon the air, as though slow reveal by the 
rising of a curtain. it apparently had not then quite concentrated to 
the normal proportions, but was spread out on all side into space, 
huge, though rapid condensing, for i saw the colossal shoulders, the 
neck, the lower portion of the dark jaws, the terrible mouth, and then 
the teeth and lips--and, as the veil seem to lift further upon the 
tremendous face--i saw the nose and cheek bones. in another moment i 
should have look straight into the eyes-- 

but what dr. silence did at that moment was so unexpected, and took me 
so by surprise, that i have never yet properly understood its nature, 
and he has never yet seen fit to explain in detail to me. he utter 
some sound that had a note of command in it--and, in so doing, step 
forward and intervene between me and the face. the figure, just near 
completeness, he therefore hid from my sight--and i have always thought 
purposely hid from my sight. 

"the fire!" he cry out. "the fire! beware!" 

there was a sudden roar as of flame from the very mouth of the pit, and 
for the space of a single second all grew light as day. a blind flash 
pass across my face, and there was heat for an instant that seem to 
shrivel skin, and flesh, and bone. then came steps, and i heard colonel 
wragge utter a great cry, wild than any human cry i have ever known. 
the heat suck all the breath out of my lung with a rush, and the 
blaze of light, as it vanished, swept my vision with it into envelop 
darkness. 

when i recover the use of my senses a few moments later i saw that 
colonel wragge with a face of death, its white strange stained, 
had move close to me. dr. silence stood beside him, an expression of 
triumph and success in his eyes. the next minute the soldier try to 
clutch me with his hand. then he reeled, staggered, and, unable to save 
himself, fell with a great crash upon the brick floor. 

after the sheet of flame, a wind rage round the building as though it 
would lift the roof off, but then pass as sudden as it came. and in 
the intense calm that follow i saw that the form had vanished, and the 
doctor was stoop over colonel wragge upon the floor, try to lift 
him to a sitting position. 

"light," he said quietly, "more light. take the shades off." 

colonel wragge sat up and the glare of the unshaded lamp fell upon his 
face. it was grey and drawn, still running heat, and there was a look in 
the eyes and about the corner of the mouth that seem in this short 
space of time to have add years to its age. at the same time, the 
expression of effort and anxiety had left it. it show relief. 

"gone!" he said, look up at the doctor in a daze fashion, and 
struggle to his feet. "thank god! it's gone at last." he stare round 
the laundry as though to find out where he was. "did it control me--take 
possession of me? did i talk nonsense?" he ask bluntly. "after the 
heat came, i remember nothing--" 

"you'll feel yourself again in a few minutes," the doctor said. to my 
infinite horror i saw that he was surreptitious wipe sundry dark 
stain from the face. "our experiment has been a success and--" 

he gave me a swift glance to hide the bowl, standing between me and our 
host while i hurried stuff it down under the lid of the nearest 
cauldron. 

"--and none of us the worse for it," he finished. 

"and fires?" he asked, still dazed, "there'll be no more fires?" 

"it is dissipated--partly, at any rate," reply dr. silence cautiously. 

"and the man behind the gun," he went on, only half realise what he 
was saying, i think; "have you discover _that?_" 

"a form materialised," said the doctor briefly. "i know for certain now 
what the direct intelligence was behind it all." 

colonel wragge pull himself together and got upon his feet. the words 
convey no clear meaning to him yet. but his memory was return 
gradually, and he was try to piece together the fragment into a 
connected whole. he shiver a little, for the place had grown sudden 
chilly. the air was empty again, lifeless. 

"you feel all right again now," dr. silence said, in the tone of a man 
state a fact rather than ask a question. 

"thanks to you--both, yes." he drew a deep breath, and mop his face, 
and even attempt a smile. he made me think of a man coming from the 
battlefield with the stain of fight still upon him, but scornful of 
his wounds. then he turn grave towards the doctor with a question 
in his eyes. memory had return and he was himself again. 

"precisely what i expected," the doctor said calmly; "a fire-elemental 
sent upon its mission in the days of thebes, century before christ, 
and tonight, for the first time all these thousand of years, release 
from the spell that originally bound it." 

we stare at him in amazement, colonel wragge opening his lip for words 
that refuse to shape themselves. 

"and, if we dig," he continue significantly, point to the floor 
where the black had pour up, "we shall find some underground 
connection--a tunnel most likely--leading to the twelve acre wood. it 
was made by--your predecessor." 

"a tunnel made by my brother!" gasp the soldier. "then my sister 
should know--she live here with him--" he stop suddenly. 

john silence inclined his head slowly. "i think so," he said quietly. 
"your brother, no doubt, was as much torment as you have been," he 
continue after a pause in which colonel wragge seem deep 
preoccupied with his thoughts, "and try to find peace by bury it in 
the wood, and surrounding the wood then, like a large magic circle, with 
the enchantment of the old formulae. so the stars the man saw 
blazing--" 

"but bury what?" ask the soldier faintly, step backwards 
towards the support of the wall. 

dr. silence regard us both intent for a moment before he replied. i 
think he weigh in his mind whether to tell us now, or when the 
investigate was absolutely complete. 

"the mummy," he said softly, after a moment; "the mummy that your 
brother took from its rest place of centuries, and brought 
home--here." 

colonel wragge drop down upon the nearest chair, hanging breathless 
on every word. he was far too amaze for speech. 

"the mummy of some important person--a priest most likely--protected 
from disturbance and desecrate by the ceremonial magic of the time. 
for they understood how to attach to the mummy, to lock up with it in 
the tomb, an elemental force that would direct itself even after age 
upon any one who dare to molest it. in this case it was an elemental of 
fire." 

dr. silence cross the floor and turn out the lamp one by one. he 
had nothing more to say for the moment. following his example, i fold 
the table together and took up the chairs, and our host, still daze and 
silent, mechanical obey him and move to the door. 

we remove all trace of the experiment, taking the empty bowl back to 
the house conceal beneath an ulster. 

the air was cool and fragrant as we walk to the house, the stars 
beginning to fade overhead and a fresh wind of early morning blow up 
out of the east where the sky was already hint of the coming day. it 
was after five o'clock. 

stealthy we enter the front hall and lock the door, and as we went 
on tiptoe upstairs to our rooms, the colonel, peer at us over his 
candle as he nod good-night, whisper that if we were ready the 
digging should be begun that very day. 

then i saw him steal along to his sister's room and disappear. 


iv 

but not even the mysterious reference to the mummy, or the prospect of 
a revelation by digging, were able to hinder the reaction that follow 
the intense excitement of the past twelve hours, and i slept the sleep 
of the dead, dreamless and undisturbed. a touch on the shoulder woke me, 
and i saw dr. silence standing beside the bed, dress to go out. 

"come," he said, "it's tea-time. you've slept the best part of a dozen 
hours." 

i sprang up and made a hurried toilet, while my companion sat and 
talked. he look fresh and rested, and his manner was even quiet than 
usual. 

"colonel wragge has provided spade and pickaxes. we're go out to 
unearth this mummy at once," he said; "and there's no reason we should 
not get away by the morning train." 

"i'm ready to go tonight, if you are," i said honestly. 

but dr. silence shook his head. 

"i must see this through to the end," he said gravely, and in a tone 
that made me think he still anticipate serious things, perhaps. he went 
on talk while i dressed. 

"this case is really typical of all story of mummy-haunting, and none 
of them are case to trifle with," he explained, "for the mummy of 
important people--kings, priests, magicians--were laid away with 
profound significant ceremonial, and were very effectively protected, 
as you have seen, against desecration, and especially against 
destruction. 

"the general belief," he went on, anticipate my questions, "held, of 
course, that the perpetuity of the mummy guarantee that of its ka,--the 
owner's spirit,--but it is not improbable that the magical embalm 
was also use to retard reincarnation, the preservation of the body 
prevent the return of the spirit to the toil and discipline of 
earth-life; and, in any case, they knew how to attach powerful 
guardian-forces to keep off trespassers. and any one who dare to remove 
the mummy, or especially to unwind it--well," he added, with meaning, 
"you have seen--and you will see." 

i caught his face in the mirror while i struggle with my collar. it was 
deep serious. there could be no question that he spoke of what he 
believe and knew. 

"the traveller-brother who brought it here must have been haunt too," 
he continued, "for he try to banish it by burial in the wood, making a 
magic circle to enclose it. something of genuine ceremonial he must have 
known, for the stars the man saw were of course the remains of the still 
flaming pentagram he trace at interval in the circle. only he did not 
know enough, or possibly was ignorant that the mummy's guardian was a 
fire-force. fire cannot be enclose by fire, though, as you saw, it can 
be release by it." 

"then that awful figure in the laundry?" i asked, thrill to find him 
so communicative. 

"undoubtedly the actual ka of the mummy operate always behind its 
agent, the elemental, and most likely thousand of years old." 

"and miss wragge--?" i venture once more. 

"ah, miss wragge," he repeated with increase gravity, "miss wragge--" 

a knock at the door brought a servant with word that tea was ready, and 
the colonel had sent to ask if we were coming down. the thread was 
broken. dr. silence move to the door and sign to me to follow. but 
his manner told me that in any case no real answer would have been 
forthcoming to my question. 

"and the place to dig in," i asked, unable to restrain my curiosity, 
"will you find it by some process of divination or--?" 

he pause at the door and look back at me, and with that he left me to 
finish my dressing. 

it was grow dark when the three of us silent made our way to the 
twelve acre plantation; the sky was overcast, and a black wind came out 
of the east. gloom hung about the old house and the air seem full of 
sighings. we found the tool ready laid at the edge of the wood, and 
each shoulder his piece, we follow our leader at once in among the 
trees. he went straight forward for some twenty yard and then stopped. 
at his feet lay the blacken circle of one of the burn places. it was 
just discern against the surrounding white grass. 

"there are three of these," he said, "and they all lie in a line with 
one another. any one of them will tap the tunnel that connect the 
laundry--the former museum--with the chamber where the mummy now lie 
buried." 

he at once clear away the burnt grass and began to dig; we all began 
to dig. while i use the pick, the other shovel vigorously. no one 
spoke. colonel wragge work the hardest of the three. the soil was 
light and sandy, and there were only a few snake-like roots and 
occasional loose stone to delay us. the pick made short work of these. 
and meanwhile the dark settled about us and the biting wind swept 
roaring through the tree overhead. 

then, quite suddenly, without a cry, colonel wragge disappear up to 
his neck. 

"the tunnel!" cry the doctor, helping to drag him out, red, 
breathless, and cover with sand and perspiration. "now, let me lead 
the way." and he slip down nimble into the hole, so that a moment 
later we heard his voice, muffle by sand and distance, rising up to us. 

"hubbard, you come next, and then colonel wragge--if he wishes," we 
heard. 

"i'll follow you, of course," he said, look at me as i scramble in. 

the hole was big now, and i got down on all-fours in a channel not 
much big than a large sewer-pipe and found myself in total darkness. 
a minute later a heavy thud, follow by a cataract of loose sand, 
announce the arrival of the colonel. 

"catch hold of my heel," call dr. silence, "and colonel wragge can 
take yours." 

in this slow, laborious fashion we worm our way along a tunnel that 
had been roughly dug out of the shift sand, and was shore up 
clumsy by means of wooden pillar and posts. any moment, it seem to 
me, we might be bury alive. we could not see an inch before our eyes, 
but had to grope our way feeling the pillar and the walls. it was 
difficult to breathe, and the colonel behind me made but slow progress, 
for the cramped position of our body was very severe. 

we had travelled in this way for ten minutes, and gone perhaps as much 
as ten yards, when i lost my grasp of the doctor's heel. 

"ah!" i heard his voice, sound above me somewhere. he was standing up 
in a clear space, and the next moment i was standing beside him. colonel 
wragge came heavy after, and he too rose up and stood. then dr. 
silence produce his candle and we heard preparation for striking 
matches. 

yet even before there was light, an indefinable sensation of awe came 
over us all. in this hole in the sand, some three feet under ground, we 
stood side by side, cramped and huddled, struck sudden with an over 
whelm apprehension of something ancient, something formidable, 
something incalculable wonderful, that touched in each one of us a sense 
of the sublime and the terrible even before we could see an inch before 
our faces. i know not how to express in language this singular emotion 
that caught us here in utter darkness, touching no sense directly, it 
seemed, yet with the recognition that before us in the black of this 
underground night there lay something that was mighty with the 
mighty of long past ages. 

i felt colonel wragge press in close to my side, and i understood the 
pressure and welcome it. no human touch, to me at least, has ever been 
more eloquent. 

then the match flared, a thousand shadow flee on black wings, and i saw 
john silence fumble with the candle, his face lit up grotesque by 
the flicker light below it. 

i had dread this light, yet when it came there was apparently nothing 
to explain the profound sensation of dread that precede it. we stood 
in a small vaulted chamber in the sand, the side and roof shore with 
bar of wood, and the ground laid roughly with what seem to be tiles. 
it was six feet high, so that we could all stand comfortably, and may 
have been ten feet long by eight feet wide. upon the wooden pillar at 
the side i saw that egypt hieroglyphics had been rudely trace by 
burning. 

dr. silence lit three candle and hand one to each of us. he placed a 
fourth in the sand against the wall on his right, and another to mark 
the entrance to the tunnel. we stood and stare about us, instinctive 
holding our breath. 

"empty, by god!" exclaim colonel wragge. his voice tremble with 
excitement. and then, as his eyes rest on the ground, he added, "and 
footsteps--look--footsteps in the sand!" 

dr. silence said nothing. he stoop down and began to make a search of 
the chamber, and as he moved, my eyes follow his crouch figure and 
noted the queer distort shadow that pour over the wall and ceiling 
after him. here and there thin trickle of loose sand ran fizz down 
the sides. the atmosphere, heavy charged with faint yet pungent 
odours, lay utterly still, and the flame of the candle might have been 
paint on the air for all the movement they betrayed. 

and, as i watched, it was almost necessary to persuade myself forcibly 
that i was only standing upright with difficulty in this little 
sand-hole of a modern garden in the south of england, for it seem to 
me that i stood, as in vision, at the entrance of some vast rock-hewn 
temple far, far down the river of time. the illusion was powerful, and 
persisted. granite columns, that rose to heaven, pile themselves about 
me, majestic uprearing, and a roof like the sky itself spread above 
a line of colossal figures that move in shadowy procession along 
endless and stupendous aisles. this huge and splendid fantasy, borne i 
knew not whence, possessed me so vivid that i was actually oblige to 
concentrate my attention upon the small stoop figure of the doctor, 
as he grope about the walls, in order to keep the eye of imagination on 
the scene before me. 

but the limited space render a long search out of the question, and 
his footsteps, instead of shuffle through loose sand, presently struck 
something of a different quality that gave forth a hollow and resounding 
echo. he stoop to examine more closely. 

he was standing exactly in the centre of the little chamber when this 
happened, and he at once began scrape away the sand with his feet. in 
less than a minute a smooth surface became visible--the surface of a 
wooden covering. the next thing i saw was that he had raise it and was 
peer down into a space below. instantly, a strong odour of nitre and 
bitumen, mingle with the strange perfume of unknown and powdered 
aromatics, rose up from the uncover space and fill the vault, 
sting the throat and making the eyes water and smart. 

"the mummy!" whisper dr. silence, look up into our face over his 
candle; and as he said the word i felt the soldier lurch against me, and 
heard his breathing in my very ear. 

"the mummy!" he repeated under his breath, as we pressed forward to 
look. 

it is difficult to say exactly why the sight should have stir in me 
so prodigious an emotion of wonder and veneration, for i have had not a 
little to do with mummies, have unwound score of them, and even 
experiment magical with not a few. but there was something in the 
sight of that grey and silent figure, lie in its modern box of lead 
and wood at the bottom of this sandy grave, swathe in the bandage of 
century and wrap in the perfume linen that the priest of egypt 
had pray over with their mighty enchantment thousand of years 
before--something in the sight of it lie there and breathing its own 
spice-laden atmosphere even in the dark of its exile in this remote 
land, something that pierce to the very core of my being and touched 
that root of awe which slumber in every man near the birth of tear and 
the passion of true worship. 

i remember turning quick from the colonel, lest he should see my 
emotion, yet fail to understand its cause, turn and clutch john silence 
by the arm, and then fall tremble to see that he, too, had lower his 
head and was hiding his face in his hands. 

a kind of whirl storm came over me, rising out of i know not what 
utter deep of memory, and in a white of vision i heard the magical 
old chaunt from the book of the dead, and saw the gods pass by in 
dim procession, the mighty, immemorial being who were yet themselves 
only the personify attribute of the true gods, the god with the eyes 
of fire, the god with the face of smoke. i saw again anubis, the 
dog-faced deity, and the children of horus, eternal watch of the ages, 
as they swathe osiris, the first mummy of the world, in the scent and 
mystic bands, and i taste again something of the ecstasy of the 
justified soul as it embark in the golden boat of ra, and journey 
onwards to rest in the field of the blessed. 

and then, as dr. silence, with infinite reverence, stoop and touched 
the still face, so dreadfully staring with its paint eyes, there rose 
again to our nostril wave upon wave of this perfume of thousand of 
years, and time flee backwards like a thing of naught, showing me in 
haunt panorama the most wonderful dream of the whole world. 

a gentle hiss became audible in the air, and the doctor move quick 
backwards. it came close to our face and then seem to play about the 
wall and ceiling. 

"the last of the fire--still wait for its full accomplishment," he 
muttered; but i heard both words and hiss as things far away, for i 
was still busy with the journey of the soul through the seven hall of 
death, listen for echo of the grandest ritual ever known to men. 

the earthen plate cover with hieroglyphics still lay beside the 
mummy, and round it, careful arrange at the points of the compass, 
stood the four jar with the head of the hawk, the jackal, the 
cynocephalus, and man, the jar in which were placed the hair, the nail 
parings, the heart, and other special portion of the body. even the 
amulets, the mirror, the blue clay statue of the ka, and the lamp with 
seven wick were there. only the sacred scarabaeu was missing. 

"not only has it been torn from its ancient resting-place," i heard dr. 
silence saying in a solemn voice as he look at colonel wragge with 
fixed gaze, "but it has been partially unwound,"--he pointed to the 
wrapping of the breast,--"and--the scarabaeu has been remove from the 
throat." 

the hissing, that was like the hiss of an invisible flame, had 
ceased; only from time to time we heard it as though it pass backwards 
and forward in the tunnel; and we stood look into each other's face 
without speaking. 

presently colonel wragge made a great effort and brace himself. i heard 
the sound catch in his throat before the words actually became audible. 

"my sister," he said, very low. and then there follow a long pause, 
broken at length by john silence. 

"it must be replaced," he said significantly. 

"i knew nothing," the soldier said, force himself to speak the words 
he hate saying. "absolutely nothing." 

"it must be returned," repeated the other, "if it is not now too late. 
for i fear--i fear--" 

colonel wragge made a movement of assent with his head. 

"it shall be," he said. 

the place was still as the grave. 

i do not know what it was then that made us all three turn round with so 
sudden a start, for there was no sound audible to my ears, at least. 

the doctor was on the point of replace the lid over the mummy, when he 
straighten up as if he had been shot. 

"there's something coming," said colonel wragge under his breath, and 
the doctor's eyes, peer down the small opening of the tunnel, show 
me the true direction. 

a distant shuffle noise became distinct audible coming from a point 
about half-way down the tunnel we had so laborious penetrated. 

"it's the sand fall in," i said, though i knew it was foolish. 

"no," said the colonel calmly, in a voice that seem to have the ring 
of iron, "i've heard it for some time past. it is something alive--and 
it is coming nearer." 

he stare about him with a look of resolution that made his face almost 
noble. the horror in his heart was overmastering, yet he stood there 
prepared for anything that might come. 

"there's no other way out," john silence said. 

he lean the lid against the sand, and waited. i knew by the masklike 
expression of his face, the pallor, and the steady of the eyes, that 
he anticipate something that might be very terrible--appalling. 

the colonel and myself stood on either side of the opening. i still held 
my candle and was ashamed of the way it shook, dripping the grease all 
over me; but the soldier had set his into the sand just behind his feet. 

thought of being bury alive, of being smother like rats in a trap, 
of being caught and done to death by some invisible and merciless force 
we could not grapple with, rush into my mind. then i thought of 
fire--of suffocation--of being roast alive. the perspiration began to 
pour from my face. 

"steady!" came the voice of dr. silence to me through the vault. 

for five minutes, that seem fifty, we stood waiting, look from 
each other's face to the mummy, and from the mummy to the hole, and all 
the time the shuffle sound, soft and stealthy, came gradual nearer. 
the tension, for me at least, was very near the break point when at 
last the cause of the disturbance reach the edge. it was hidden for a 
moment just behind the broken rim of soil. a jet of sand, shaken by the 
close vibration, trickle down on to the ground; i have never in my life 
seen anything fall with such laborious leisure. the next second, 
utter a cry of curious quality, it came into view. 

and it was far more distressing horrible than anything i had 
anticipated. 

for the sight of some egypt monster, some god of the tombs, or even 
of some demon of fire, i think i was already half prepared; but when, 
instead, i saw the white visage of miss wragge frame in that round 
opening of sand, follow by her body crawl on all fours, her eyes 
bulge and reflect the yellow glare of the candles, my first 
instinct was to turn and run like a frantic animal seek a way of 
escape. 

but dr. silence, who seem no whit surprised, caught my arm and 
steady me, and we both saw the colonel then drop upon his knee and 
come thus to a level with his sister. for more than a whole minute, as 
though struck in stone, the two face gaze silent at each other: 
hers, for all the dreadful emotion in it, more like a gargoyle than 
anything human; and his, white and blank with an expression that was 
beyond either astonishment or alarm. she look up; he look down. it 
was a picture in a nightmare, and the candle, stuck in the sand close to 
the hole, threw upon it the glare of impromptu footlights. 

then john silence move forward and spoke in a voice that was very low, 
yet perfectly calm and natural. 

"i am glad you have come," he said. "you are the one person whose 
presence at this moment is most required. and i hope that you may yet be 
in time to appease the anger of the fire, and to bring peace again to 
your household, and," he add lower still so that no one heard it but 
myself, "_safety to yourself_." 

and while her brother stumble backwards, crush a candle into the 
sand in his awkwardness, the old lady crawl farther into the vaulted 
chamber and slow rose upon her feet. 

at the sight of the wrap figure of the mummy i was fully prepared to 
see her scream and faint, but on the contrary, to my complete amazement, 
she merely bowed her head and drop quiet upon her knees. then, 
after a pause of more than a minute, she raise her eyes to the roof and 
her lip began to mutter as in prayer. her right hand, meanwhile, which 
had been fumble for some time at her throat sudden came away, and 
before the gaze of all of us she held it out, palm upwards, over the 
grey and ancient figure outstretched below. and in it we beheld 
glisten the green jasper of the stolen scarabaeus. 

her brother, leaning heavy against the wall behind, utter a sound 
that was half cry, half exclamation, but john silence, standing directly 
in front of her, merely fixed his eyes on her and pointed downwards to 
the staring face below. 

"replace it," he said sternly, "where it belongs." 

miss wragge was kneel at the feet of the mummy when this happened. we 
three men all had our eyes rivet on what followed. only the reader who 
by some remote chance may have witness a line of mummies, freshly laid 
from their tomb upon the sand, slow stir and bend as the heat of the 
egypt sun warm their ancient body into the semblance of life, can 
form any conception of the ultimate horror we experienced when the 
silent figure before us move in its grave of lead and sand. slowly, 
before our eyes, it writhed, and, with a faint rustling of the 
immemorial cerements, rose up, and, through sightless and bandage eyes, 
stare across the yellow candlelight at the woman who had violate it. 

i try to move--her brother try to move--but the sand seem to hold 
our feet. i try to cry--her brother try to cry--but the sand seem 
to fill our lung and throat. we could only stare--and, even so, the 
sand seem to rise like a desert storm and cloud our vision ... 

and when i manage at length to open my eyes again, the mummy was lie 
once more upon its back, motionless, the shrunken and paint face 
upturned towards the ceiling, and the old lady had tumble forward and 
was lie in the semblance of death with her head and arms upon its 
crumble body. 

but upon the wrapping of the throat i saw the green jasper of the 
sacred scarabaeu shining again like a living eye. 

colonel wragge and the doctor recover themselves long before i did, 
and i found myself helping them clumsy and unintelligent to raise 
the frail body of the old lady, while john silence careful replace 
the covering over the grave and scrape back the sand with his foot, 
while he issue brief directions. 

i heard his voice as in a dream; but the journey back along that cramped 
tunnel, weighted by a dead woman, blind with sand, suffocate with 
heat, was in no sense a dream. it took us the best part of half an hour 
to reach the open air. and, even then, we had to wait a considerable 
time for the appearance of dr. silence. we carry her undiscovered into 
the house and up to her own room. 

"the mummy will cause no further disturbance," i heard dr. silence say 
to our host later that evening as we prepared to drive for the night 
train, "provided always," he add significantly, "that you, and yours, 
cause it no disturbance." 

it was in a dream, too, that we left. 

"you did not see her face, i know," he said to me as we wrap our rug 
about us in the empty compartment. and when i shook my head, quite 
unable to explain the instinct that had come to me not to look, he 
turn toward me, his face pale, and genuine sad. 

"scorched and blasted," he whispered.
