[sidenote: _a curious and terrify story about an artist who sold his 
soul that he might paint a living picture_] 


i had come to the art museum to see the special show of goya prints, but 
that particular gallery was so crowded that i could hardly get in, much 
less see or savor anything; wherefore i walk out again. i wander 
through the other wings with their row and row of oils, their greece 
and roman sculptures, their stern ranks of medieval armors, their 
oriental porcelains, their egypt gods. at length, by chance and not 
by design, i came to the head of a certain rear stairway. other habitués 
of the museum will know the one i mean when i remind them that arnold 
böcklin's _the isle of the dead_ hang on the wall of the landing. 

i start down, relish in advance the impression böcklin's picture 
would make with its high brown rocks and black poplars, its midnight sky 
and gloomy film of sea, its single white figure erect in the bow of the 
beach-nosing skiff. but, as i descended, i saw that _the isle of the 
dead_ was not in its accustomed position on the wall. in that space, 
arrest even in the bad light and from the up-angle of the stairs, 
hung a gilt-framed painting i had never seen or heard of in all my 
museum-haunting years. 

i gaze at it, one will imagine, all the way down to the landing. then i 
had a close, searching look, and a final appraise stare from the lip 
of the landing above the lower half of the flight. so far as i can 
learn--and i have been diligent in my research--the thing is unknown 
even to the best-informed of art experts. perhaps it is as well that i 
describe it in detail. 

it seem to represent action upon a small plateau or table rock, drab 
and bare, with a twilight sky deepen into a starless evening. this 
setting, restrained work up in blue-grays and blue-blacks, was not 
the first thing to catch the eye, however. the front of the picture was 
fill with lively dance creatures, as pink, plump and naked as 
cherub and as patently evil as the meditation of satan in his rare 
idle moments. 

i count those dancers. there were twelve of them, range in a 
half-circle, and they were cavort in evident glee around a central 
object--a prone cross, which appear to be made of two stout log with 
some of the bark still upon them. to this cross a pair of the pink 
things--that make fourteen--kneeling and swinging blocky-looking 
hammer or mauls, spike a human figure. 

i say _human_ when i speak of that figure, and i withhold the word in 
describe the dance and their hammer-wielding fellows. there is a 
reason. the supine victim on the cross was a beautiful represent 
male body, as clear and anatomical correct as an illustration in a 
surgical textbook. the head was writhe around, as if in pain, and i 
could not see the face or its expression; but in the torture tense 
of the muscles, in the slaty white sheen of the skin with jagged streak 
of vivid gore upon it, agonized nature was plain and doubly plain. i 
could almost see the paint limb writhe against the transfix nails. 

by the same token, the dance and hammer were so dynamic done as 
to seem half in motion before my eyes. so much for the sound skill of 
the painter. yet, where the crucify prisoner was all clarity, these 
other were all fog. no lines, no angles, no muscles--their features 
could not be seen or sensed. i was not even sure if they had hair or 
not. it was as if each was picked out with a ray of light in that 
surrounding dusk, light that reveal and yet shimmer indistinctly; 
light, too, that had absolutely nothing of comfort or honesty in it. 

* * * * * 

"hold on, there!" came a sharp challenge from the stairs behind and 
below me. "what are you doing? and what's that picture doing?" 

i start so that i almost lost my footing and fell upon the 
speaker--one of the museum guards. he was a slight old fellow and his 
thin hair was gray, but he advanced upon me with all the righteous, 
angry pluck of a beefy policeman. his attitude surprise and nettle me. 

"i was go to ask somebody that same question," i told him as 
austere as i could manage. "what about this picture? i thought there 
was a böcklin hanging here." 

the guard relax his forbidding attitude at first sound of my voice. 
"oh, i beg your pardon, sir. i thought you were somebody else--the man 
who brought that thing." he nod at the picture, and the hostile glare 
came back into his eyes. "it so happen that he talk to me first, 
then to the curator. said it was art--great art--and the museum must 
have it." he lift his shoulders, in a shrug or a shudder. "personally, 
i think it's plain beastly." 

so it was, i grew aware as i look at it again. "and the museum has 
accept it at last?" i prompted. 

he shook his head. "oh, no, sir. an hour ago he was at the back door, 
with that nasty daub there under his arm. i heard part of the argument. 
he got insulting, and he was told to clear out and take his picture with 
him. but he must have got in here somehow, and hung it himself." walking 
close to the painting, as gingerly as though he expect the pink 
dance to leap out at him, he pointed to the lower edge of the frame. 
"if it was a real museum piece, we'd have a plate right there, with the 
name of the painter and the title." 

i, too, came close. there was no plate, just as the guard had said. but 
in the lower left-hand corner of the canvas were sprawl capitals, 
pale paint on the dark, spelling out the word _golgotha_. beneath these, 
in small, barely readable script: 

_i sold my soul that i might paint a living picture._ 

no signature or other clue to the artist's identity. 

the guard had discover a great frame rectangle against the wall to 
one side. "here's the picture he took down," he informed me, highly 
relieved. "help me put it back, will you, sir? and do you suppose," here 
he grew almost wistful, "that we could get rid of this other thing 
before someone find i let the crazy fool slip past me?" 

i took one edge of _the isle of the dead_ and lift it to help him hang 
it once more. 

"tell you what," i offer on sudden impulse; "i'll take this _golgotha_ 
piece home with me, if you like." 

"would you do that?" he almost yell out in his joy at the suggestion. 
"would you, to oblige me?" 

"to oblige myself," i returned. "i need another picture at my place." 

and the upshot of it was, he smuggle me and the unwanted painting out 
of the museum. never mind how. i have done quite enough as it is to 
jeopardize his job and my own welcome up there. 

* * * * * 

it was not until i had paid off my taxi and lug the unwieldy 
parallelogram of canvas and wood upstairs to my bachelor apartment that 
i bother to wonder if it might be valuable. i never did find out, but 
from the first i was deep impressed. 

hung over my own fireplace, it look as large and living as a scene 
glimpse through a window or, perhaps, on a stage in a theater. the 
caper pink body caught new lights from my lamp, lights that gloss 
and intensify their shape and color but did not reveal any new 
details. i pore once more over the cryptic legend: _i sold my soul that 
i might paint a living picture._ 

a living picture--was it that? i could not answer. for all my honest 
delight in such things, i cannot be call expert or even knowing as 
regards art. did i even like the golgotha painting? i could not be sure 
of that, either. and the rest of the inscription, about sell a soul; 
i was considerably intrigue by that, and let my thought ramble on the 
subject of satanist complex and the vagary of half-crazy painters. 
as i read, that evening, i glance up again and again at my new 
possession. sometimes it seem ridiculous, sometimes sinister. shortly 
after midnight i rose, gaze once more, and then turn out the parlor 
lamp. for a moment, or so it seemed, i could see those dancers, so many 
dim-pink silhouette in the sudden darkness. i went to the kitchen for a 
bit of whisky and water, and thence to my bedroom. 

i had dreams. in them i was a boy again, and my mother and sister were 
leave the house to go to a theater where--think of it!--richard 
mansfield would play _beau brummell_. i, the youngest, was told to stay 
at home and mind the troublesome furnace. i wept copious in my 
disappointed loneliness, and then mansfield himself stalk in, in full 
brummell regalia. he laugh golden and stretch out his hand in warm 
greeting. i, the lad of my dreams, put out my own hand, then was 
frightened when he would not loosen his grasp. i tugged, and he laugh 
again. the gold of his laughter turn sudden hard, cold. i tug 
with all my strength, and woke. 

* * * * * 

something held me tight by the wrist. 

* * * * * 

in my first half-moment of wakeful i was aware that the room was 
fill with the pink dance of the picture, in nimble, fierce-happy 
motion. they were man-size, too, or nearly so, visible in the dark with 
the dim radiance of fox-fire. on the small scale of the painting they 
had seem no more than babyish plump; now they were gross, like huge 
erect toads. and, as i awaken fully, they were close in, a menace 
ring of them, around my bed. one stood at my right side, and its grip, 
clumsy and rubbery-hard like that of a monkey, was closed upon my arm. 

* * * * * 

i saw and sense all this, as i say, in a single moment. with the 
sense came the realization of peril, so great that i did not stop to 
wonder at the uncanny of my visitors. i try frantic to jerk 
loose. for the moment i did not succeed and as i thrash about, 
throw my body nearly across the bed, a second dance dashed in from 
the left. it seize and clamp my other arm. i felt, rather than heard, 
a wave of soft, wordless merriment from them all. my heart and sinew 
seem to fail, and brief i lay still in a daze of horror, pin down 
crucifix-fashion between my two captors. 

was that a _hammer_ raise above me as i sprawled? 

there rush and swell into me the sudden startle strength that 
sometimes favor the desperate. i scream like any wild thing caught in 
a trap, roll somehow out of bed and to my feet. one of the being i 
shook off and the other i dashed against the bureau. freed, i made for 
the bedroom door and the front of the apartment, stumble and 
staggering on fear-weakened legs. 

one of the dim-shining pink things barred my way at the very threshold, 
and the other were close in behind, as if for a sudden rush. i flung 
my right fist with all my strength and weight. the being bob back 
unresisting before my smash, like a rubber toy floating through water. 
i plunge past, reach the entry and fumble for the knob of the outer 
door. 

they were all about me then, their rubbery palm fumble at my 
shoulders, my elbows, my pajama jacket. they would have drag me down 
before i could negotiate the lock. a rack shudder possessed me and 
seem to flick them clear. then i stumble against a stand, and purely 
by good luck my hand fell upon a bamboo walking-stick. i yell again, 
in truly hysterical fierceness, and laid about me as with a whip. my 
blow did little or no damage to those unearthly assailants, but they 
shrank back, teeter and dancing, to a safe distance. again i had the 
sense that they were laughing, mocking. for the moment i had beaten them 
off, but they were sure of me in the end. just then my grope free hand 
pressed a switch. the entry sprang into light. 

on the instant they were not there. 

* * * * * 

somebody was knock outside, and with tremble finger i turn the 
knob of the door. in came a tall, slender girl with a blue lounging-robe 
caught hurried around her. her bright hair was disorder as though 
she had just sprung from her bed. 

"is someone sick?" she ask in a breathless voice. "i live down the 
hall--i heard cries." her round blue eyes were study my face, which 
must have been ghastly pale. "you see, i'm a train nurse, and 
perhaps----" 

"thank god you did come!" i broke in, unceremonious but honestly, and 
went before her to turn on every lamp in the parlor. 

it was she who, without guidance, search out my whisky and siphon and 
mixed for me a highball of grateful strength. my teeth rang nervous on 
the edge of the glass as i gulp it down. after that i got my own 
robe--a becoming one, with satin facings--and sat with her on the divan 
to tell of my adventure. when i had finished, she gaze long at the 
painting of the dancers, then back at me. her eyes, like two chip of 
the april sky, were full of concern and she held her rosy lower lip 
between her teeth. i thought that she was wonderful pretty. 

"what a perfectly terrible nightmare!" she said. 

"it was no nightmare," i protested. 

she smile and argue the point, telling me all manner of comfort 
things about mental association and their reflection in vivid dreams. 

to clinch her point she turn to the painting. 

"this line about a 'living picture' is the peg on which your slumber 
mind hung the whole fabric," she suggested, her slender fingertip 
touching the paint scribble. "your very literal subconscious self 
didn't understand that the artist meant his picture would live only 
figuratively." 

"are you sure that's what the artist meant?" i asked, but finally i let 
her convince me. one can imagine how badly i want to be convinced. 

she mixed me another highball, and a short one for herself. over it she 
told me her name--miss dolby--and finally she left me with a last 
comfort assurance. but, nightmare or no, i did not sleep again that 
night. i sat in the parlor among the lamps, smoking and dip into 
book after book. countless times i felt my gaze drawn back to the 
painting over the fireplace, with the cross and the nail-pierced wretch 
and the shimmer pink dancers. 

after the rising sun had fill the apartment with its honest light and 
cheer i felt considerably calmer. i slept all morning, and in the 
afternoon was disposed to agree with miss dolby that the whole business 
had been a bad dream, nothing more. dressing, i went down the hall, 
knock on her door and invite her to dinner with me. 

it was a good dinner. afterward we went to an amuse motion picture, 
with charles butterworth in it as i remember. after bidding her 
good-night, i went to my own place. undressed and in bed, i lay awake. 
my late morning slumber made my eyes slow to close. thus it was that i 
heard the faint shuffle of feet and, sitting up against my pillows, saw 
the glowing silhouette of the golgotha dancers. alive and magnified, 
they were creep into my bedroom. 

i did not hesitate or shrink this time. i sprang up, tense and defiant. 

"no, you don't!" i yell at them. as they seem to hesitate before the 
impact of my wild voice, i charged frantically. for a moment i scattered 
them and got through the bedroom door, as on the previous night. there 
was another shindy in the entry; this time they all got hold of me, like 
a pack of hounds, and wrestle me back against the wall. i writhe even 
now when i think of the unearthly hardness of their little gripping 
paws. two on each arm were spread-eagling me upon the plaster. the 
cruciform position again! 

i swore, yell and kicked. one of them was in the way of my foot. he 
float back, unhurt. that was their strength and horror--their ability 
to go flabby and non-resistant under smashing, flatten blows. 
something tickle my palm, prick it. the point of a spike.... 

"miss dolby!" i shrieked, as a child might call for its mother. "help! 
miss d----" 

the door flew open; i must not have lock it. "here i am," came her 
unafraid reply. 

she was outline against the rectangle of light from the hall. my 
assailant let go of me to dance toward her. she gasp but did not 
scream. i stagger along the wall, touched a light-switch, and the 
parlor just beyond us flared into visibility. miss dolby and i ran in to 
the lamp, rally there as stone-age folk must have rally at their 
fire to face the monster of the night. i look at her; she was still 
fully dressed, as i had left her, apparently had been sitting up. her 
rouge made flat patch on her pale cheeks, but her eyes were level. 

* * * * * 

this time the dance did not retreat or vanish; they lurk in the 
comparative gloom of the entry, jig and tremble as if muster 
their powers and resolution for another rush at us. 

"you see," i chatter out to her, "it wasn't a nightmare." 

she spoke, not in reply, but as if to herself. "they have no faces," she 
whispered. "no faces!" in the half-light that was diffuse upon them 
from our lamp they present the featureless of so many huge 
gingerbread boys, cover with pink icing. one of them, some kind of 
leader, pressed forward within the circle of the light. it daunt him a 
bit. he hesitated, but did not retreat. 

from my center table miss dolby had picked up a bright paper-cutter. she 
poised it with the assurance of one who know how to handle cutting 
instruments. 

"when they come," she said steadily, "let's stand close together. we'll 
be hard to drag down that way." 

i want to shout my admiration of her fearless front toward the 
dreadful beings, my thankful for her quick run to my rescue. all i 
could mumble was, "you're mighty brave." 

she turn for a moment to look at the picture above my die fire. my 
eyes follow hers. i think i expect to see a blank canvas--find that 
the paint dance had vanish from it and had grown into the living 
ones. but they were still in the picture, and the cross and the victim 
were there, too. miss dolby read aloud the inscription: 

"_a living picture_ ... the artist knew what he was talk about, after 
all." 

"couldn't a living picture be killed?" i wondered. 

it sound uncertain, and a childish quibble to boot, but miss dolby 
exclaim triumphantly, as at an inspiration. 

"killed? yes!" she shouted. she sprang at the picture, dart out with 
the paper-cutter. the point rip into one of the central figures in 
the dance semicircle. 

all the crowd in the entry seem to give a concerted throb, as of 
startle protest. i swung, heart racing, to front them again. what had 
happened? something had changed, i saw. the intrepid leader had 
vanished. no, he had not drawn back into the group. he had vanished. 

miss dolby, too, had seen. she struck again, gash the paint 
representation of another dancer. and this time the vanish happen 
before my eyes, a creature at the rear of the group went out of 
existence as sudden and completely as though a light had blink out. 

the others, driven by their danger, rushed. 

i met them, feet planted. i try to embrace them all at once, went over 
backward under them. i struck, wrenched, tore. i think i even bit 
something grisly and bloodless, like fungoid tissue, but i refuse to 
remember for certain. one or two of the form struggle past me and 
grapple miss dolby. i struggle to my feet and pull them back from 
her. there were not so many swarm after me now. i fought hard before 
they got me down again. and miss dolby kept tear and stabbing at the 
canvas--again, again. clutches melt from my throat, my arms. there 
were only two dance left. i flung them back and rose. only one left. 
then none. 

they were gone, gone into nowhere. 

"that did it," said miss dolby breathlessly. 

she had pull the picture down. it was only a frame now, with ragged 
ribbon of canvas dangle from it. 

i snatch it out of her hand and threw it upon the coal of the fire. 

"look," i urge her joyfully. "it's burning! that's the end. do you 
see?" 

"yes, i see," she answer slowly. "some fiend-ridden artist--his evil 
genius brought it to life." 

"the inscription is the literal truth, then?" i supplied. 

"truth no more." she bent to watch the burning. "as the paint figures 
were destroyed, their incarnation faded." 

we said nothing further, but sat down together and gaze as the flame 
ate the last thread of fabric, the last splinter of wood. finally we 
look up again and smile at each other. 

all at once i knew that i love her.
