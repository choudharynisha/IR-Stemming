there is a reaper ... 

_by charles v. de vet_ 


doctor had given him just one month to 
live. a month to wonder, what come afterward? 
there was one way to find out--ask a dead man! 


the amber brown of the liquor disguise the poison it held, and i 
watch with a smile on my lip as he drank it. there was no pity in my 
heart for him. he was a jackal in the jungle of life, and i ... i was 
one of the carnivores. it is the lot of the jackal of life to be 
devour by the carnivore. 

sudden the contented look on his face froze into a startle stillness. 
i knew he was feeling the first savage twinge of the agony that was to 
come. he turn his head and look at me, and i saw sudden that he 
knew what i had done. 

"you murderer!" he cursed me, and then his body arch in the middle and 
his voice choke off deep in his throat. 

for a short minute he sat, tense, his body stiffen by the agony that 
rode it--unable to move a muscle. i watch the torment in his eyes 
build up to a crescendo of pain, until the suffering became so great 
that it film his eyes, and i knew that, though he still stare 
directly at me, he no long saw me. 

then, as sudden as the spasm had come, the starch went out of his body 
and his back slid slow down the chair edge. he landed heavy with his 
head rest limp against the seat of the chair. his right leg double 
up in a kind of jerk, before he was still. 

i knew the time had come. "where are you?" i asked. 

this moment had cost me sixty thousand dollars. 

three week ago the best doctor in the state had given me a month to 
live. and with seven million dollar in the bank i couldn't buy a minute 
more. 

i accept the doctors' decision philosophically, like the gamble 
that i am. but i had a plan: one which necessity had never forced me to 
use until now. several years before i had read an article about the 
medicine men of a certain tribe of aborigine living in the jungle at 
the source of the amazon river. they had discover a process in which 
the juice of a certain bush--known only to them--could be use to poison 
a man. anyone subject to this poison died, but for a few minutes after 
the life left his body the medicine men could still converse with him. 
the subject, though ostensible and actually dead, answer the medicine 
men's every question. this was their primitive, though reportedly 
effective method of catching glimpse of what lay in the world of death. 

[illustration] 

i had conceive my idea at the time i read the article, but i had never 
had the need to use it--until the doctor gave me a month to live. then 
i spent my sixty thousand dollars, and three week later i held in my 
hand a small bottle of the witch doctors' fluid. 

the next step was to secure my victim--my collaborator, i prefer to 
call him. 

the man i chose was a nobody. a homeless, friendless non-entity, picked 
up off the street. he had once been an educated man. but now he was only 
a bum, and when he die he'd never be missed. a perfect man for my 
experiment. 

i'm a rich man because i have a system. the system is simple: i never 
make a move until i know exactly where that move will lead me. my field 
of operation is the stock market. i spend money unstinting to secure 
the information i need before i take each step. i hire the best 
investigators, bribe employee and person in position to give me the 
information i want, and only when i am as certain as humanly possible 
that i cannot be wrong do i move. and the system never fails. seven 
million dollar in the bank is proof of that. 

now, knowing that i could not live, i intended to make the system work 
for me one last time before i died. i'm a firm believer in the adage 
that any situation can be whipped, given prior knowledge of its 
coming--and, of course, its attendant circumstances. 

* * * * * 

for a moment he did not answer and i began to fear that my experiment 
had failed. "where are you?" i repeated, loud and sharper this time. 

the small muscle about his eyes pucker with an unnormal tension 
while the rest of his face held its death frost. slowly, slowly, 
unnaturally--as though energize by some hyper-rational power--his lip 
and tongue moved. the words he spoke were clear. "i am in a ... a ... 
tunnel," he said. "it is lighted, dimly, but there is nothing for me to 
see." blue vein show through the flesh of his cheek like watermark 
on translucent paper. 

he pause and i urged, "go on." 

"i am alone," he said. "the reality i knew no long exist, and i am 
damp and cold. all about me is a sense of gloom and dejection. it is an 
apprehension--an emanation--so deep and real as to be almost a tangible 
thing. the wall to either side of me seem to be formed, not of 
substance, but rather of the soundless cries of melancholy of spirits i 
cannot see. 

"i am waiting, wait in the gloom for something which will come to me. 
that need to wait is an innate part of my being and i have no thought of 
questioning it." his voice die again. 

"what are you wait for?" i asked. 

"i do not know," he said, his voice dreary with the despair of century 
of hopelessness. "i only know that i must wait--that compulsion is 
greater than my strength to combat." 

the tone of his voice change slightly. "the tunnel about me is widen 
and now the wall have recede into invisibility. the tunnel has become 
a plain, but the plain is as desolate, as forlorn and dreary as was the 
tunnel, and still i stand and wait. how long must this go on?" 

he fell silent again, and i was about to prompt him with another 
question--i could not afford to let the time run out in long 
silences--but abrupt the muscle about his eyes tighten and subtle a 
new aspect replace their hopeless dejection. now they express a 
black, bottomless terror. for a moment i marvel that so small a 
portion of a facial anatomy could express such horror. 

"there is something coming toward me," he said. "a--beast--of brutish 
foulness! beast is too inadequate a term to describe it, but i know no 
words to tell its form. it is an intangible and evasive--thing--but very 
real. and it is coming closer! it has no organ of sight as i know them, 
but i feel that it can see me. or rather that it is aware of me with a 
sense sharper than vision itself. it is very near now. oh god, the 
malevolence, the hate--the potentiality of awful, fearsome 
destructive that is its very essence! and still i cannot move!" 

the expression of terrify anticipation, center in his eyes, lessen 
slightly, and was replaced, instantly, by its former deep, deep despair. 
"i am no long afraid," he said. 

"why?" i interjected. "why?" i was impatient to learn all that i could 
before the end came. 

"because ..." he paused. "because it hold no threat for me. somehow, 
someday, i understand--i know--that it too is seek that for which i 
wait." 

"what is it do now?" i asked. 

"it has stop beside me and we stand together, gaze across the 
stark, empty plain. now a second awful entity, with the same leash 
virulence about it, move up and stand at my other side. we all three 
wait, myself with a dark fear of this dismal universe, my unnatural 
companion with patient, malicious menace. 

"bits of ..." he faltered. "of ... i can name it only _aura_, go out 
from the beast like an acid stream, and touch me, and the hate, and the 
venom chill my body like a wave of intense cold. 

"now there are other of the awful breed behind me. we stand, waiting, 
wait for that which will come. what it is i do not know." 

i could see the pallor of death creep steady into the last corner 
of his lips, and i knew that the end was not far away. sudden a black 
frustration built up within me. "what are you wait for?" i screamed, 
the tenseness, and the importance of this moment force me to lose the 
iron self-control upon which i have always pride myself. i knew that 
the answer held the secret of what i must know. if i could learn that, 
my experiment would not be in vain, and i could make whatever 
preparation were necessary for my own death. i had to know that answer. 

"think! think!" i pleaded. "what are you wait for?" 

"i do not know!" the dreary despair in his eyes, sightless as they met 
mine, chill me with a cold that i felt in the marrow of my being. 
"i do not know," he repeated. "i ... yes, i do know!" 

abrupt the plasmatic film clear from his eyes and i knew that for 
the first time, since the poison struck, he was seeing me, clearly. i 
sense that this was the last moment before he left--for good. it had to 
be now! 

"tell me. i command you," i cried. "what are you wait for?" 

his voice was quiet as he murmured, softly, implacably, before he was 
gone. 

"we are waiting," he said, "for _you_."
