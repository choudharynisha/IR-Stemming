chapter x. 

of the effect of each planet in each of the twelve house 

saturn in the first house, or ascendant, show melancholy and many 

sorrows, and if near the ascendant probability of early death; in the 

second house pecuniary troubles; in the third quarrel with brother 

and sisters, and danger and loss in travelling; in the fourth house 

death of father or mother, and loss of friends; in the fifth barren 

or death of children; in the sixth illness, worry with servant and 

loss from cattle; in the seventh an ungovernable wife and unhappy 

marriage; in the eighth violent death and loss of legacies; in the 

ninth loss by sea; in the tenth dishonour and imprisonment; in the 

eleventh deep depression and false friends; in the twelfth sorrow, 

trouble and persecution from secret enemies. if the planet is 

strong—that is, well-dignified—these evil are much lessened. 

jupiter in the first house give a good, happy and long life; in the 

second riches; in the third family affection and fortunate short 

journeys; in the fourth lands and inheritance with an honourable life 

and end; in the fifth many children who are good and affectionate; in 

the sixth faithful servant and fortunate dealings respecting cattle; 

in the seventh honourable marriage; in the eighth long life and natural 

death; in the ninth profitable sea voyages; in the tenth preferment and 

honours; in the eleventh faithful friends; in the twelfth victory over 

secret enemies. this, of course, means when the planet is strong in 

dignities; if weak the good will be somewhat abated. 

mars in the first house show short of life and scar on the head 

or face; in the second poverty and troubles; in the third quarrel with 

kindred and danger in travelling; in the fourth short life to the 

fathers; in the fifth disobedient children; in the sixth fevers, bad 

servants, and loss of cattle; in the seventh sensuality and unhappy 

in marriage; in the eighth a violent death; in the ninth irreligion and 

loss at sea; in the tenth military preferment, but trouble from 

great dignitaries; in the eleventh false friends and loss of money; in 

the twelfth imprisonment. this is when mars is afflicted, but if 

well-aspected these evil are somewhat abated. 

the sun in the first house give honour, glory, and long life; in the 

second much riches, but great extravagance; in the third good brethren 

and fortunate journeys; in the fourth a noble inheritance and honours 

in old age; in the fifth few children, yet such as will be a comfort; 

in the sixth disease of the mind; in the seventh a good wife, 

honourable adversaries, and sickness; in the eighth good dowry with the 

wife, but danger of a violent death; in the ninth gain by the sea, and 

ecclesiastical dignities; in the tenth gain from prince and noble 

women; in the eleventh distinguished friendships; in the twelfth 

powerful adversaries. this is if the sun is well-dignified; if weak the 

good fortune is not so pronounced. 

venus in the first house give good health, but sensuality as regards 

the opposite sex; in the second riches by means of women; in the third, 

in a woman's horoscope, by means of lovers above her in rank; in the 

fourth inheritance; in the fifth many children; in the sixth illness 

from excesses; in the seventh a good and beautiful wife and very few 

enemies; in the eighth a good dowry with the wife and a natural death; 

in the ninth good fortune by sea; in the tenth honour and preferment 

through the means of some one of the opposite sex; in the eleventh 

sympathetic friends; in the twelfth freedom from the power of private 

enemies. this if venus be strong; if weak the good fortune is less 

pronounced. 

mercury in the first house give noble thoughts, graceful elocution, 

and love of art and science; in the second profit by intellectual work; 

in the third mathematics skill, swift and prosperous journeys; in the 

fourth the gain of an inheritance by craftiness; in the fifth clever 

children; in the sixth thieving servant and disease of the brain; in 

the seventh a foment of quarrels, but a discreet wife; in the eighth 

death by consumption; in the ninth wonderful ability, especially in 

occult matters; in the tenth much preferment for ability; in the 

eleventh inconstant friends; in the twelfth secret enemies, but they 

will not much affect the destiny. this is when mercury is 

well-dignified. if weak the good fortune is much lessened. 

the moon in the ascendant, or first house, show the native will travel 

and will gain the favour of noble persons; in the second she sometimes 

give unstable fortune, riches, and poverty alternately; in the third 

long journeys; in the fourth profit by travelling; in the fifth many 

children; in the sixth disease of the brain, but good servants; in the 

seventh honourable marriage; in the eighth danger by drowning, but 

otherwise a long and healthy life; in the ninth many long sea voyages, 

inconstant in religion, and love of art; in the tenth great honours; 

in the eleventh the friendship of noble personages; in the twelfth the 

common people will be the native's enemy and do him much wrong. 

the dragon's head when posit in the first house show poverty; in the 

second a good estate; in the third honest kindred and fortunate 

journeys; in the fourth gain by travels; in the fifth long life and 

good children; in the sixth health and good servants; in the seventh a 

virtuous wife; in the eighth many legacy and a natural death; in the 

ninth prosperity at sea; in the tenth honour; in the eleventh faithful 

friends; in the twelfth open enemies. 

the dragon's tail in the same place signify the contrary in all 

things.
