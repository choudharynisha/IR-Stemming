preface 
a man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern alabama, look down 
into the swift water twenty feet below. the man's hand were behind 
his back, the wrist bound with a cord. a rope close encircle his 
neck. it was attach to a stout cross-timber above his head and the 
slack fell to the level of his knees. some loose boards laid upon the 
tie support the rails of the railway supply a footing for him 
and his executioners--two private soldier of the federal army, 
direct by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy 
sheriff. at a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an 
officer in the uniform of his rank, armed. he was a captain. a 
sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the 
position known as "support," that is to say, vertical in front of the 
left shoulder, the hammer rest on the forearm thrown straight 
across the chest--a formal and unnatural position, enforce an erect 
carriage of the body. it did not appear to be the duty of these two 
men to know what was occur at the center of the bridge; they 
merely blockade the two end of the foot planking that traverse it. 

beyond one of the sentinel nobody was in sight; the railroad ran 
straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was 
lost to view. doubtless there was an outpost farther along. the 
other bank of the stream was open ground--a gentle slope top with 
a stockade of vertical tree trunks, loophole for rifles, with a 
single embrasure through which protrude the muzzle of a brass cannon 
commanding the bridge. midway up the slope between the bridge and 
fort were the spectators--a single company of infantry in line, at 
"parade rest," the butt of their rifles on the ground, the barrel 
incline slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hand 
cross upon the stock. a lieutenant stood at the right of the line, 
the point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand rest upon his 
right. excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a 
man moved. the company face the bridge, staring stonily, motionless. 
the sentinels, facing the bank of the stream, might have been statue 
to adorn the bridge. the captain stood with fold arms, silent, 
observing the work of his subordinates, but making no sign. death is a 
dignitary who when he come announce is to be received with formal 
manifestation of respect, even by those most familiar with him. in 
the code of military etiquette silence and fixity are form of 
deference. 

the man who was engaged in being hang was apparently about 
thirty-five years of age. he was a civilian, if one might judge from 
his habit, which was that of a planter. his features were good--a 
straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark 
hair was comb straight back, fall behind his ear to the collar 
of his well fitting frock coat. he wore a moustache and pointed 
beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a 
kindly expression which one would hardly have expect in one whose 
neck was in the hemp. evidently this was no vulgar assassin. the 
liberal military code make provision for hanging many kind of 
persons, and gentlemen are not excluded. 

the preparation being complete, the two private soldier step 
aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. 
the sergeant turn to the captain, salute and placed himself 
immediately behind that officer, who in turn move apart one pace. 
these movements left the condemn man and the sergeant standing on 
the two end of the same plank, which span three of the cross-ties 
of the bridge. the end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not 
quite, reach a fourth. this plank had been held in place by the 
weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant. at a 
signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would 
tilt and the condemn man go down between two ties. the arrangement 
commend itself to his judgement as simple and effective. his face 
had not been cover nor his eyes bandaged. he look a moment at his 
"unsteadfast footing," then let his gaze wander to the swirl water 
of the stream racing madly beneath his feet. a piece of dance 
driftwood caught his attention and his eyes follow it down the 
current. how slow it appear to move! what a sluggish stream! 

he closed his eyes in order to fix his last thought upon his wife and 
children. the water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brood 
mists under the bank at some distance down the stream, the fort, the 
soldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him. and now he 
became conscious of a new disturbance. striking through the thought 
of his dear one was sound which he could neither ignore nor 
understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of 
a blacksmith's hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ring quality. 
he wonder what it was, and whether immeasurable distant or near by-- 
it seem both. its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the 
toll of a death knell. he await each new stroke with impatience 
and--he knew not why--apprehension. the interval of silence grew 
progressive longer; the delay became maddening. with their greater 
infrequent the sound increase in strength and sharpness. they hurt 
his ear like the thrust of a knife; he fear he would shriek. what he 
heard was the ticking of his watch. 

he unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him. "if i could 
free my hands," he thought, "i might throw off the noose and spring 
into the stream. by dive i could evade the bullet and, swimming 
vigorously, reach the bank, take to the wood and get away home. my 
home, thank god, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little 
one are still beyond the invader's farthest advance." 

as these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were 
flash into the doom man's brain rather than evolve from it the 
captain nod to the sergeant. the sergeant step aside. 

ii 

peyton farquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and highly 
respect alabama family. being a slave owner and like other slave 
owner a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and 
ardent devoted to the southern cause. circumstances of an imperious 
nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevent him from 
taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous 
campaign ending with the fall of corinth, and he chafe under the 
inglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the 
large life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction. that 
opportunity, he felt, would come, as it come to all in wartime. 
meanwhile he did what he could. no service was too humble for him to 
perform in the aid of the south, no adventure too perilous for him to 
undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at 
heart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much 
qualification assent to at least a part of the frankly villainous 
dictum that all is fair in love and war. 

one evening while farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench 
near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the 
gate and ask for a drink of water. mrs. farquhar was only too happy 
to serve him with her own white hands. while she was fetching the 
water her husband approach the dusty horseman and inquire eager 
for news from the front. 

"the yank are repair the railroads," said the man, "and are 
get ready for another advance. they have reach the owl creek 
bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. the 
commandant has issue an order, which is post everywhere, declare 
that any civilian caught interfere with the railroad, its bridges, 
tunnels, or train will be summary hanged. i saw the order." 

"how far is it to the owl creek bridge?" farquhar asked. 

"about thirty miles." 

"is there no force on this side of the creek?" 

"only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single 
sentinel at this end of the bridge." 

"suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the 
picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel," said 
farquhar, smiling, "what could he accomplish?" 

the soldier reflected. "i was there a month ago," he replied. "i 
observe that the flood of last winter had lodge a great quantity of 
driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. it is 
now dry and would burn like tinder." 

the lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. he 
thank her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. an 
hour later, after nightfall, he repass the plantation, go 
northward in the direction from which he had come. he was a federal 
scout. 

iii 

as peyton farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost 
consciousness and was as one already dead. from this state he was 
awakened--ages later, it seem to him--by the pain of a sharp 
pressure upon his throat, follow by a sense of suffocation. keen, 
poignant agony seem to shoot from his neck downward through every 
fiber of his body and limbs. these pains appear to flash along well 
define lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivable rapid 
periodicity. they seem like stream of pulsate fire heating him 
to an intolerable temperature. as to his head, he was conscious of 
nothing but a feeling of fullness--of congestion. these sensation 
were unaccompanied by thought. the intellectual part of his nature 
was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was 
torment. he was conscious of motion. encompass in a luminous cloud, 
of which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material 
substance, he swung through unthinkable arc of oscillation, like a 
vast pendulum. then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light 
about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful 
roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark. the power of 
thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had 
fallen into the stream. there was no additional strangulation; the 
noose about his neck was already suffocate him and kept the water 
from his lungs. to die of hanging at the bottom of a river!--the idea 
seem to him ludicrous. he open his eyes in the dark and saw 
above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible! he was 
still sinking, for the light became faint and faint until it was a 
mere glimmer. then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he 
was rising toward the surface--knew it with reluctance, for he was now 
very comfortable. "to be hang and drowned," he thought, "that is 
not so bad; but i do not wish to be shot. no; i will not be shot; 
that is not fair." 

he was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist 
apprise him that he was try to free his hands. he gave the 
struggle his attention, as an idle might observe the feat of a 
juggler, without interest in the outcome. what splendid effort!--what 
magnificent, what superhuman strength! ah, that was a fine endeavor! 
bravo! the cord fell away; his arms part and float upward, the 
hand dim seen on each side in the grow light. he watch them 
with a new interest as first one and then the other pounce upon the 
noose at his neck. they tore it away and thrust it fierce aside, 
its undulation resemble those of a water snake. "put it back, put 
it back!" he thought he shout these words to his hands, for the 
undoing of the noose had been succeed by the direst pang that he had 
yet experienced. his neck ache horribly; his brain was on fire, his 
heart, which had been flutter faintly, gave a great leap, try to 
force itself out at his mouth. his whole body was rack and wrench 
with an insupportable anguish! but his disobedient hand gave no heed 
to the command. they beat the water vigorous with quick, downward 
strokes, force him to the surface. he felt his head emerge; his 
eyes were blind by the sunlight; his chest expand convulsively, 
and with a supreme and crown agony his lung engulf a great 
draught of air, which instantly he expel in a shriek! 

he was now in full possession of his physical senses. they were, 
indeed, preternatural keen and alert. something in the awful 
disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that 
they made record of things never before perceived. he felt the 
ripple upon his face and heard their separate sound as they struck. 
he look at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual 
trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf--he saw the very 
insect upon them: the locusts, the brilliant body flies, the gray 
spider stretch their web from twig to twig. he noted the 
prismatic colors in all the dewdrop upon a million blade of grass. 
the hum of the gnat that dance above the eddy of the stream, 
the beating of the dragon flies' wings, the stroke of the water 
spiders' legs, like oar which had lift their boat--all these made 
audible music. a fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the 
rush of its body parting the water. 

he had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the 
visible world seem to wheel slow round, himself the pivotal point, 
and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldier upon the bridge, the 
captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners. they were 
in silhouette against the blue sky. they shout and gesticulated, 
point at him. the captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire; 
the other were unarmed. their movements were grotesque and horrible, 
their form gigantic. 

sudden he heard a sharp report and something struck the water 
smart within a few inch of his head, spatter his face with 
spray. he heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinel with 
his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the 
muzzle. the man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge 
gaze into his own through the sight of the rifle. he observe that 
it was a gray eye and remember have read that gray eyes were 
keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them. nevertheless, this one 
had missed. 

a counter-swirl had caught farquhar and turn him half round; he was 
again look at the forest on the bank opposite the fort. the sound 
of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind 
him and came across the water with a distinct that pierce and 
subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripple in his ears. 
although no soldier, he had frequent camp enough to know the dread 
significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirate chant; the 
lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning's work. how 
cold and pitilessly--with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, 
and enforce tranquil in the men--with what accurate measured 
interval fell those cruel words: 

"company! . . . attention! . . . shoulder arms! . . . ready!. . . 
aim! . . . fire!" 

farquhar dived--dived as deep as he could. the water roar in his 
ear like the voice of niagara, yet he heard the dull thunder of the 
volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bit of 
metal, singularly flattened, oscillate slow downward. some of 
them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away, continue 
their descent. one lodge between his collar and neck; it was 
uncomfortable warm and he snatch it out. 

as he rose to the surface, gasp for breath, he saw that he had been 
a long time under water; he was perceptible farther downstream--nearer 
to safety. the soldier had almost finished reloading; the metal 
ramrod flash all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from 
the barrels, turn in the air, and thrust into their sockets. the 
two sentinel fire again, independent and ineffectually. 

the hunt man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming 
vigorous with the current. his brain was as energetic as his arms 
and legs; he thought with the rapid of lightning: 

"the officer," he reasoned, "will not make that martinet's error a 
second time. it is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. he 
has probably already given the command to fire at will. god help me, 
i cannot dodge them all!" 

an appalling splash within two yard of him was follow by a loud, 
rush sound, diminuendo, which seem to travel back through the air 
to the fort and die in an explosion which stir the very river to 
its deeps! a rising sheet of water curve over him, fell down upon 
him, blind him, strangle him! the cannon had taken an hand in the 
game. as he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten 
water he heard the deflect shot hum through the air ahead, and 
in an instant it was crack and smashing the branch in the forest 
beyond. 

"they will not do that again," he thought; "the next time they will 
use a charge of grape. i must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke 
will apprise me--the report arrive too late; it lag behind the 
missile. that is a good gun." 

sudden he felt himself whirl round and round--spinning like a top. 
the water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and 
men, all were commingle and blurred. object were represent by 
their colors only; circular horizontal streak of color--that was all 
he saw. he had been caught in a vortex and was being whirl on with a 
velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. in few 
moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of 
the stream--the southern bank--and behind a project point which 
conceal him from his enemies. the sudden arrest of his motion, the 
abrasion of one of his hand on the gravel, restore him, and he wept 
with delight. he dug his finger into the sand, threw it over himself 
in handful and audible blessed it. it look like diamonds, rubies, 
emeralds; he could think of nothing beautiful which it did not 
resemble. the tree upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted 
a definite order in their arrangement, inhale the fragrance of their 
blooms. a strange roseate light shone through the space among their 
trunks and the wind made in their branch the music of aeolian harps. 
he had not wish to perfect his escape--he was content to remain in 
that enchanting spot until retaken. 

a whiz and a rattle of grapeshot among the branch high above his 
head rouse him from his dream. the baffle cannon had fire him a 
random farewell. he sprang to his feet, rush up the slope bank, 
and plunge into the forest. 

all that day he traveled, lay his course by the round sun. the 
forest seem interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not 
even a woodman's road. he had not known that he live in so wild a 
region. there was something uncanny in the revelation. 

by nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famished. the thought of his 
wife and children urge him on. at last he found a road which led him 
in what he knew to be the right direction. it was as wide and 
straight as a city street, yet it seem untraveled. no field 
border it, no dwelling anywhere. not so much as the bark of a 
dog suggest human habitation. the black body of the tree form 
a straight wall on both sides, terminate on the horizon in a point, 
like a diagram in a lesson in perspective. overhead, as he look up 
through this rift in the wood, shone great golden stars look 
unfamiliar and group in strange constellations. he was sure they 
were arrange in some order which had a secret and malign 
significance. the wood on either side was full of singular noises, 
among which--once, twice, and again--he distinct heard whisper in 
an unknown tongue. 

his neck was in pain and lift his hand to it found it horrible 
swollen. he knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had 
bruise it. his eyes felt congested; he could no long close them. 
his tongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrust 
it forward from between his teeth into the cold air. how soft the 
turf had carpet the untraveled avenue--he could no long feel the 
roadway beneath his feet! 

doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, 
for now he see another scene--perhaps he has merely recover from a 
delirium. he stand at the gate of his own home. all is as he left 
it, and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. he must 
have traveled the entire night. as he push open the gate and pass 
up the wide white walk, he see a flutter of female garments; his 
wife, look fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to 
meet him. at the bottom of the steps she stand waiting, with a smile 
of ineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. ah, how 
beautiful she is! he spring forward with extend arms. as he is 
about to clasp her he feel a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; 
a blind white light blazes all about him with a sound like the 
shock of a cannon--then all is dark and silence! 

peyton farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently 
from side to side beneath the timber of the owl creek bridge.
