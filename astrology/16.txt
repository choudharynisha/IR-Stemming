FALL AND REDEMPTION OF MAN.

Religion having been based upon the worship of personified

nature, it is evident that its founders fabricated

its dogmatic element from their conceptions of her destructive

and reproductive processes as manifested in the

rotation and diversity of the seasons. The apparent retreat

of the sun from the earth, in winter, and his return in

the spring, suggesting the idea of a figurative death and

resurrection of the genius of that luminary, they applied

these phenomena of the year to man, and composed the

allegories relative to his fall and redemption, as inculcated

in the Exoteric Creed. In the allegory relating to the fall,

it was taught that, after making the first human pair, the

Lord of Good or the Lord God placed them in a beautiful

garden—corresponding to the seasons of fruits and flowers

or months of Spring and Summer, with the injunction,

under a penalty, not to eat of the fruit of a certain tree.

When the Lord of Evil, or Devil, symbolized by the serpent

and represented by the constellation "Serpens"

placed in conjunction with the Autumnal Equinox, meeting

them on the confines of his dominion, and tempting

the woman, and she the man, they ate of the forbidden

fruit; thus, falling from their first estate, and committing

the original sin, they involved the whole human race in the

consequences of their disobedience. Then the Lord God,

pronouncing a curse against the serpent, clothed the man

and woman with skins to protect them against the inclemency

of his, dominion as Lord of Evil, and drove them

from the garden; after which they were necessitated to

earn their bread by tilling the ground.

In, reference to the plan of redemption, the ancient

Astrologers divided the 6,000 years appropriated to man,

as the duration of his race on earth, into ten equal cycles,

and taught that at the conclusion of each God Sol, as

Lord of Good, would manifest himself in the flesh, to destroy

his works as Lord of Evil, and through suffering

and death make an atonement for sin. Thus having originated

the doctrines of original sin, incarnation and vicarious

atonement, as parts of the plan of redemption, and

making its finale correspond, in point of time, to the conclusion

of the 12,000 year cycle, their successors in the

priestly office ultimately inculcated the additional dogmas

of the general judgment and future rewards and punishments,

as we have shown in our introduction.

Having based the fables of the fall and redemption of

man upon the idea that he was impelled, without his

volition, to pass from the dominion of God to that of the

Devil, or in other words, upon his subjection to the inexorable

necessity which makes the inclement seasons

of Autumn and Winter succeed the beneficent ones of

Spring and Summer, its authors composed the original

of the text which, found in Romans viii., 20, reads that

"The creature was made subject to vanity (Evil), not willingly,

but by reason of him who hath subjected the same

in hope."

But for the popular teaching in favor of its being

literal history, no one could read the account of the fall of

man, as recorded in the third chapter of Genesis, without

recognizing it as simply an allegory; or fail to realize, the

force of the argument of no fall, no redemption, and if no

redemption, no God to reward or Devil to punish; no hell

to suffer, or heaven to enjoy. The fact is that these are

but antithetical ideas which came in together, and must

survive or perish together. They cannot be separated

without destroying the whole theological fabric.

INCARNATIONS OF GOD SOL.

Believing that God Sol was necessitated to remain at

his post to direct the course of the sun, the ancient astrologers

conceived the idea of teaching that, attended by a

retinue of subordinate genii, he descended to earth

through the medium of incarnations at the end of 600 year

cycles, to perform the work of man's redemption and,

having made Virgo of the Zodiac the mother of the Solar

divinity, they taught in their allegorical Astronomy, or

scriptures, that his incarnations were born of a Virgin.

Hence we find that God Sol, usually designated by the

title of the Word, "was made flesh, and dwelt among us."

John i., 14.

In a discourse upon this text delivered by Tillotson,

Archbishop of Canterbury, in the year 1680, published in

the fourth volume of Woodhouse's edition of his Grace's

sermons, in the year 1744, concerning the Incarnation of

our blessed Saviour, he explains the necessity of incarnation

by saying that "There was likewise a great inclination

in mankind to the worship of a visible Deity, so God was

pleased to appear in our nature, that they, who were so

fond of a visible Deity, might have one, even a true and

natural image of God the Father, the express image of

his person." It only requires a little reflection to appreciate

the Prelate's covert irony and want of faith.

Having ascribed to the imaginary incarnations of

God Sol the characteristics of heaven-descending, virgin-born,

earth-walking, wonder-working, dying, resuscitated

and ascending sons of God, the ancient Astrologers

attached to them the several titles of Saviour, Redeemer,

Avatar, Divine-Helper, Shiloh, Messiah, Christ; and, in

reference to their foster-father, that of Son of Man.

Teaching that they continued to make intercession for sin,

after their ascension to the right hand of the Father, they

were also called Intercessors, Mediators or Advocates

with the Father. From teaching their appearance every

600 years originated the Egyptian legend of the Phoenix,

a bird said to descend from the sun at these intervals, and,

after being consumed upon the altar in the temple of On,

or city of the sun—called Heliopolis by the Greeks—would

rise from its ashes and ascend to its source. According

to the civil laws of Egypt, manhood was not

attained until the age of thirty years. Hence the earthly

mission of incarnate Saviours was made to begin at that

age; and for the reason that, relating to the apparent transit

of the sun through the twelve signs of the Zodiac, it

was completed during the period of one year.

To impress the ignorant masses with the belief that

the scriptures were literal histories, and the incarnate

Saviours real personages, the ancient Astrologers caused

tombs to be erected in which it was claimed they were

buried. Such sepulchres were erected to Hercules at

Cadiz, to Apollo at Delphi, and to other Saviours at many

other places, to which their respective votaries were induced

to perform pilgrimages. In Egypt the pyramids

were built, partly for astronomical purposes, and partly

as tombs for Saviours, claimed to have been kings, who

had once ruled over the country; and why should we not

recognize that magnificent structure known as the Church

of the Holy Sepulchre, at Jerusalem, as but another of

those tombs of Saviours in which no Saviour was ever entombed?

Thus we have shown that it was God Sol, the only

begotten of the Father, or second person in the sacred

Triad, to whom supreme adoration was inculcated in all

forms of the ancient Astrolatry; and that its cultured

votaries, understanding that the doctrines pertaining to

the fall and redemption of man were evolved from the

figurative death and resurrection of the solar divinity,

recognized the doctrine of incarnation as a priestly invention

intended only for the ignorant masses.
