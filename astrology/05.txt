II. THE HOLLOW COLUMN

TOLD BY THE TAX-COLLECTOR

"Every man's fate is fore-ordained," said the tax-collector,

reflectively stroking his beard. "Although we may not understand it at

the moment each particular event that happens is simply a means prepared

for some destined end that may be many years remote in time. Vishnu the

Preserver saved the life of the little maid of Jhalnagor so that her

father's life might later on be saved. But none can read the future, so

that we are all blindly doing the things of to-day without knowing their

real bearing on the things of a far-away to-morrow. And one man can make

or mar the happiness of another man, even though their lives be

separated by hundreds of leagues in space or hundreds of years in time."

"In your mind doubtless is some tale to illustrate the truth of what you

teach," remarked the astrologer, with a shrewd uplifting of his

eyebrows. "The stars can help us to read the future, as I can prove to

you by a story of actual experience. But before I proceed to my

narrative, pray, friend, let us hear from you."

"Gladly," assented the tax-collector. "The story of this noble Rajput

has brought to memory an incident in my own life many years ago,

likewise serving[Pg 20] to show that the gods prepare long years ahead for the

working out of each particular man's destiny. Listen:

"As a youth I was a keeper of accounts in the service of a rich

zemindar, whose estate lay in the Country of the Five Rivers. He was a

usurer as well as a landowner, as had been his fathers before him for

many generations. So in his castle was an accumulation of great stores

of wealthâ€”gold and silver and precious stones, cloth of gold, silks,

brocades, and muslins, ivory and amber, camphor, spices, dye stuffs, and

other merchandise of divers kinds."

The Afghan general stirred, and the scabbard of his sword rattled on the

floor as, raising himself from his elbow that rested on a cushion, he

sat up and assumed an attitude of keen attention.

"Where is this place?" he asked, a wolfish gleam in his eyes, and his

lips curved to a smile that revealed, under the black, curled moustache,

the white gleam of sharp-pointed teeth.

The story-teller also smiled, knowingly, and raised a deprecatory hand.

"Nay, friend, this zemindar, my first master, was not fated to be

relieved of his treasure, as my story will tell, even though a skilful

plot had been laid for his spoliation. Which is the very point of my

tale, although I may seem to come to it by a roundabout way of telling."

The Afghan sank back on his cushion, but his gaze remained riveted on

his narrator's face.

"One day I was seated in my home, casting up my books of account, for I[Pg 21]

had only that morning completed the taking of taxes from the crops of

the rayats, the tenants of my lord. All of a sudden a white-robed figure

entered the doorway and threw himself prostrate before me. When at last

the face was raised I recognized the dhobi of the village that nestled

under the hill on which was perched the castle of the zemindar.

"'O thou washer of clothes,' I asked, 'what is thy plaint?'

"'Protector of the poor,' replied my visitor, 'behold my bandaged feet,

beaten with rods until they are swollen and torn.'

"I looked, as requested, and saw the blood-stains soaked through the

wrappings of linen.

"'Thou art an honest and a peaceful man, Bhagwan. Why this cruel

punishment?'

"'I know not, indeed. But I have come to thee, because I have endured

the wrong at the hands of thy master.'

"'Tell me thy story.'

"'As you have said, O my protector,' began the dhobi, assuming a sitting

posture and spreading the folds of his loose-flowing cotton garment over

his bandaged feet, 'I am an honest man. And it is for that very reason I

have suffered. Yesterday, among the apparel I received from the home of

the zemindar to be made clean and white was the bodice of a woman, and

tied in one corner of this piece of raiment was a ring set with bright

red stones that[Pg 22] gleamed as if they were aflame. Straightway I returned

to the palace of the zemindar, and, entering the audience chamber where,

as is his wont at that particular hour each day, he was seated receiving

the complaints of the oppressed, did my humble obeisance, and then

placed in his hand the jewel I had discovered. He asked me where I had

found it, and when I replied truthfully, his eyes flashed with anger,

and his voice thundered at me in rebuke. Although I had done no wrong,

but rather a virtuous deed, I implored for pardon. But in vain. My mind

grew confused, and the next thing I remember was the sharp cut of bamboo

rods upon the soles of my feet. I was in a small vaulted chamber, bound

to a wooden bench, surrounded by the zemindar's soldiers, and powerless

except to scream out in the agony of each blow. Thirty strokes were

counted, and then I was flung out of the gates of the castle, to limp my

way home.'

"Tears of self-pity were in the dhobi's eyes as he recounted his tale of

woe. Even then I was reflecting on the real cause of the zemindar's

wrath. The jewel had been discovered in the folds of a garment worn by

one of the women in his zenana, and his quick access of anger showed

that the gift had come from some other hand than his. Savage jealousy,

therefore, had prompted the act of injustice inflicted upon the

unfortunate washerman. I knew my master so well his sullen moods, his

outbursts of passion, that already I could arrive at this conclusion

with certainty.

"'Proceed,' I said, indifferently, for it is well that a[Pg 23] man should

keep his own counsel in such delicate affairs. 'What is my concern with

your misfortune?'

"'Harken, O dispenser of bounties! Last night when I lay nursing my

wounds, I remembered that the ring which had proved the cause of my

misery had been wrapped in a fragment of paper whereon were some strange

marks and lines as in the books of learned men. This I had flung away,

at that time deeming only the ring to be of any consequence. But the

thought came to me in the night that perhaps the paper might tell

something about the ring. So all this day have I searched among the

bushes by the stream where I beat the clothes on stones and wash them.

And behold, I have found that for which I have been seeking.'

"Hereupon the dhobi loosened the loin cloth beneath his upper garment,

and extracted from its folds a tiny roll of paper. This he presented to

me, with a bow of deference to my superior understanding of such things.

"'This time I have come to you,' he said, 'a man of learning and of

justice, not like unto the cruel zemindar. Does the paper tell why I

should have suffered such shame and pain at his hands?'

"I had unrolled the scroll, the folds of which showed that it had served

as a wrapping for the ring. The writing was in neat Persian characters,

and I had no difficulty in deciphering it, for the four lines that met

my eyes had been recited to me only a few days before by the very man

who claimed to be their author.

"Now did my very heart tremble with agitation.[Pg 24] But to the dhobi I

appeared cold as the waters of the snows that melt on the mountains.

"'This writing would only add to your troubles,' I said. 'Here, let me

destroy it.' And, turning to the red ashes burning in a brazier near at

hand, I dexterously substituted a fragment of paper, on which I had been

figuring my accounts, for the paper received, from the dhobi, placing

the former on the glowing charcoal embers and bestowing the latter in

the security of my girdle. A curl of white smoke, a puff of flame, and

the work of destruction was, to all appearance, completed.

"'In view of your misfortune, my friend,' I resumed, 'I bestow upon you

in the name of my master ten maunds of dal, which will be sent to your

home on the morrow.'

"The recipient of this unexpected bounty prostrated himself before me.

"'O prince of justice, no longer do my wounds pain me. The bellies of my

children will be filled for many long days to come.'

"'Then go thy way, rejoicing in thy heart even though limping on thy

feet. And remember that silence is golden. Say not one word more to

anyone about the ring or the paper, your punishment or the reward that

has now redressed the wrong. Go in peace.'

"And the dhobi, after profuse expressions of gratitude, hobbled from my

presence.

"Alone with my thoughts, I felt sorely troubled. The writer of the

verses of ardent poetry written on[Pg 25] the paper brought to me by the

washerman was my cherished friend, a youth from far-away Bokhara, Abdul

by name. This young man had come to our country only a year or so

before, bringing several beautiful Arab horses for sale. These the

zemindar had purchased, and had retained Abdul in his service, for the

youth was skilled in the management of horses, and in the rearing of

young stock.

"Abdul and myself were much of an age, and my regulation of expenditures

in the stables had brought us constantly together. So a close friendship

had resulted, valued greatly on my side, for I had soon come to know

that Abdul was a man of refinement and learning such as I had never

before encountered in any man of so humble a calling. And despite the

fact that he was a Moslem and I a Hindu, he had chosen me as his

intimate friend, his only confidant. Thus had it come about that at

times he had read to me of an evening songs of his own composing, and

even on occasion had sung them to the accompaniment of a small harp, the

strings of which he touched with wondrous skill and sensibility.

"Now did I know that this dear friend of mine had endangered not only
