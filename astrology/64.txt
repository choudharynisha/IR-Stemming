"Ye stars which are the poetry of Heaven!

If, in your bright leaves we read the fate

Of men and empires—'tis to be forgiven,

That in our aspirations to be great,

Our destinies o'erleap this mortal state

And claim a kindred with you; for ye are

A beauty and a mystery and create

In us such love and reverence from afar,

That Life, Fame, Power, and Fortune have named themselves a star."

Byron.

FOREWORD

Of all subjects that have at any time engaged the attention of the

world, there is none more ancient than astrology. In the East—where it

first arose at a period of very remote antiquity—it still holds sway

and in every part of the world (especially among the learned) it

reigned supreme until the middle of the seventeenth century. That it

not only ruled the daily actions of individuals but swayed the councils

of princes, is shown by the records of every nation that has a history

(and by none more fully than by that of England); yet the present

generation seems never, until quite lately, to have cared to inquire on

what basis this belief could have been for so many ages supported.

During the past ten years, however—possibly from a reaction growing

out of the realism by which we have been so long oppressed—a new

interest in these old-world beliefs has sprung up and it is to satisfy

that interest that this book (containing the results of many years'

study) was written.

Chiromancy and Physiognomy are both based on astrology and are,

therefore, quite in place as the second and third parts of a work

treating of the influence of the stars. Many of the modern writers on

Chiromancy seem disposed to deny its affinity to astrology, with which

it is, however, inseparably connected. Dr. Saunders, in the preface to

his exhaustive work on Chiromancy and Physiognomy, published in 1671,

and dedicated to his friend Lilly, the great astrologer, says: "For our

more orderly proceeding with the body of this work, it is in the first

place necessary to be observed that there are seven planets, named

Stellæ Errantes—wandering stars—which have each of them its

separate character as they are used in astrologie; the which stars have

great power over inferior bodies and do, each of them, govern some part

or other of man's body and they especially have their material

existence in the hand and without astrology Chiromancy could not

subsist and be subservient to true wisdom."

Now, why, in the face of this and many other equally forcible words

among the old-world authorities, do the modern writers try to force

their own crude theories upon us? To drag the time-honoured study of

Chiromancy into the turmoil of nineteenth-century existence and—by

robbing it of its mysticism—to strain it into unison with the realism

of modern thought, strikes the earnest student with the same sense of

incongruity as would the hanging of a carnival mask over the mystically

calm features of an antique statue.

THEINFLUENCE OF THE STARS

ASTROLOGY

"To doubt the influence of the stars is to doubt the wisdom and

providence of God."—Tycho Brahe.

 

CHAPTER I.

That a certain power, derived from æthereal nature, pervades the whole

earth, is clearly evident to all. Fire and air are altered by the

motions of the æther, and these elements, in their turn, encompassing

all inferior matter, vary it, as they themselves are varied, acting

equally on earth and water, on plants and animals. The Sun, not only by

the change of the seasons, brings to perfection the embryo of animals,

the buds of plants and the springs of water, but also, by his daily

movement, brings light, heat, moisture, dryness and cold.

The Moon, being of all the heavenly bodies the nearest to earth, has

also much influence, and things animate and inanimate sympathise and

vary with her. By her changes rivers swell or are reduced, the tides of

the sea are ruled by her risings and settings, and animals and plants

are influenced as she waxes or wanes. The stars also produce in the

ambient
