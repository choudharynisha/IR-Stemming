CHAPTER IV.

OF THE NATURES OF THE SEVEN PLANETS AND OF THEIR

ESSENTIAL AND ACCIDENTAL DIGNITIES

Of the seven planets Jupiter and Venus, because of the heat and

moisture predominant in them, are considered by the ancients as

benefics or causers of good. The Moon is so considered for the same

reasons, though in a less degree.

Saturn and Mars are causers of evil or malefic; the first from his

excess of cold, and the other from his excess of heat. The Sun and

Mercury are deemed of common influence—that is, either of good or

evil, according to the planets with which they are connected.

The planets have particular familiarity with certain places in the

zodiac by means of parts designated as their houses, and also by their

triplicities, exaltations and terms.

The nature of their familiarity by houses is as follows:—

Cancer and Leo are the most northerly of all the twelve signs; they

approach nearer than the other signs to the zenith of this part of the

earth, and thereby cause warmth and heat; they are consequently

appropriated as houses for the two principal and greater luminaries;

Leo for the Sun, as being masculine; and Cancer for the Moon, as being

feminine.

Saturn, since he is cold and inimical to heat, moving also in a

superior orbit most remote from the luminaries, occupies the signs

opposite to Cancer and Leo; these are Aquarius and Capricorn, and they

are assigned to him in consideration of their cold and wintry nature.

Jupiter has a favourable temperament, and is situated beneath the

sphere of Saturn; he, therefore, occupies the next two signs,

Sagittarius and Pisces.

Mars is dry in nature and beneath the sphere of Jupiter; he takes the

next two signs, of a nature similar to his own, viz., Aries and

Scorpio, whose relative distances from the houses of the luminaries are

injurious and discordant.

Venus, possessing a favourable temperament, and, placed beneath the

sphere of Mars, takes the next two signs, Taurus and Libra. These are

of a fruitful nature and preserve harmony by the sextile distance; this

planet is never more than two signs distant from the Sun.

Mercury never has greater distance from the Sun than the space of one

sign, and is beneath all the other planets; hence he is nearest to both

luminaries, and the remaining two signs, Gemini and Virgo, are allotted

to him.

The "houses" of the planets are readily shown by the following table.

It is exactly the same as that found in the mummy-case of the Archon of

Thebes, in ancient Egypt, as may be seen at the British Museum:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It will be seen, at once, from this table that the Sun and Moon have

each only one house assigned them. All planets are most powerful in

that sign which constitutes one of their houses. Planets receive

detriment in the signs opposite to those of their houses. Thus, Saturn

would receive detriment in Cancer and Leo, which are the signs opposite

to his houses, Capricornus and Aquarius. There are some signs in which

the planets are found to be very powerful, though not to the same

extent as when in their own houses; these are called the "exaltations"

of the planets, and the signs opposite to these are those in which they

receive their "fall" when they are considered to be weak in power.

Saturn has his exaltation in Libra; his "fall" would therefore be in

Aries. He governs the airy triplicity, which is composed of the signs

Gemini, Libra and Aquarius by day, and in all the twelve signs he has

these degrees (zodiacal signs) allotted him by Ptolemy for his Terms:

In Aries

27, 28, 29, 30.

In Taurus

23, 24, 25, 26.

In Gemini

22, 23, 24, 25.

In Cancer

28, 29, 30.

In Leo

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

In Virgo

19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

In Libra

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

In Scorpio

28, 29, 30.

In Sagittarius

21, 22, 23, 24, 25.

In Capricornus

26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

In Aquarius

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

In Pisces

27, 28, 29, 30.

The meaning of which is that if Saturn should rise in any of these

degrees it is a sign that he is not void of essential dignities; or, if

he is posited in any of the following degrees (which he is allowed for

his Face or Decanate) he is still not devoid of dignities. This is to

be understood of all the planets.
