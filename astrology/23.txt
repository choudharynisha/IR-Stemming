CHAPTER II

Comes me cranking in,

And cuts me from the best of all my land

A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle, out

Henry IV, Part 1. 

The company in the parlour at Ellangowan consisted of the Laird and a sort

of person who might be the village schoolmaster, or perhaps the minister’s

assistant; his appearance was too shabby to indicate the minister,

considering he was on a visit to the Laird.

The Laird himself was one of those second-rate sort of persons that are to

be found frequently in rural situations. Fielding has described one class

as feras consumere nati; but the love of field-sports indicates a certain

activity of mind, which had forsaken Mr. Bertram, if ever he possessed it.

A good-humoured listlessness of countenance formed the only remarkable

expression of his features, although they were rather handsome than

otherwise. In fact, his physiognomy indicated the inanity of character

which pervaded his life. I will give the reader some insight into his

state and conversation before he has finished a long lecture to Mannering

upon the propriety and comfort of wrapping his stirrup-irons round with a

wisp of straw when he had occasion to ride in a chill evening.

Godfrey Bertram of Ellangowan succeeded to a long pedigree and a short

rent-roll, like many lairds of that period. His list of forefathers

ascended so high that they were lost in the barbarous ages of Galwegian

independence, so that his genealogical tree, besides the Christian and

crusading names of Godfreys, and Gilberts, and Dennises, and Rolands

without end, bore heathen fruit of yet darker ages--Arths, and Knarths,

and Donagilds, and Hanlons. In truth, they had been formerly the stormy

chiefs of a desert but extensive domain, and the heads of a numerous tribe

called Mac-Dingawaie, though they afterwards adopted the Norman surname of

Bertram. They had made war, raised rebellions, been defeated, beheaded,

and hanged, as became a family of importance, for many centuries. But they

had gradually lost ground in the world, and, from being themselves the

heads of treason and traitorous conspiracies, the Bertrams, or

Mac-Dingawaies, of Ellangowan had sunk into subordinate accomplices. Their

most fatal exhibitions in this capacity took place in the seventeenth

century, when the foul fiend possessed them with a spirit of

contradiction, which uniformly involved them in controversy with the

ruling powers. They reversed the conduct of the celebrated Vicar of Bray,

and adhered as tenaciously to the weaker side as that worthy divine to the

stronger. And truly, like him, they had their reward.

ENLARGE 

Allan Bertram of Ellangowan, who flourished tempore Caroli primi, was,

says my authority, Sir Robert Douglas, in his Scottish Baronage (see the

title ‘Ellangowan’), ‘a steady loyalist, and full of zeal for the cause of

His Sacred Majesty, in which he united with the great Marquis of Montrose

and other truly zealous and honourable patriots, and sustained great

losses in that behalf. He had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him

by His Most Sacred Majesty, and was sequestrated as a malignant by the

parliament, 1642, and afterwards as a resolutioner in the year 1648.’

These two cross-grained epithets of malignant and resolutioner cost poor

Sir Allan one half of the family estate. His son Dennis Bertram married a

daughter of an eminent fanatic who had a seat in the council of state, and

saved by that union the remainder of the family property. But, as ill

chance would have it, he became enamoured of the lady’s principles as well

as of her charms, and my author gives him this character: ‘He was a man of

eminent parts and resolution, for which reason he was chosen by the

western counties one of the committee of noblemen and gentlemen to report

their griefs to the privy council of Charles II. anent the coming in of

the Highland host in 1678.’ For undertaking this patriotic task he

underwent a fine, to pay which he was obliged to mortgage half of the

remaining moiety of his paternal property. This loss he might have

recovered by dint of severe economy, but on the breaking out of Argyle’s

rebellion Dennis Bertram was again suspected by government, apprehended,

sent to Dunnotar Castle on the coast of the Mearns, and there broke his

neck in an attempt to escape from a subterranean habitation called the

Whigs’ Vault, in which he was confined with some eighty of the same

persuasion. The apprizer therefore (as the holder of a mortgage was then

called) entered upon possession, and, in the language of Hotspur, ‘came me

cranking in,’ and cut the family out of another monstrous cantle of their

remaining property.

Donohoe Bertram, with somewhat of an Irish name and somewhat of an Irish

temper, succeeded to the diminished property of Ellangowan. He turned out

of doors the Reverend Aaron Macbriar, his mother’s chaplain (it is said

they quarrelled about the good graces of a milkmaid); drank himself daily

drunk with brimming healths to the king, council, and bishops; held orgies

with the Laird of Lagg, Theophilus Oglethorpe, and Sir James Turner; and

lastly, took his grey gelding and joined Clavers at Killiecrankie. At the

skirmish of Dunkeld, 1689, he was shot dead by a Cameronian with a silver

button (being supposed to have proof from the Evil One against lead and

steel), and his grave is still called the Wicked Laird’s Lair.

His son Lewis had more prudence than seems usually to have belonged to the

family. He nursed what property was yet left to him; for Donohoe’s

excesses, as well as fines and forfeitures, had made another inroad upon

the estate. And although even he did not escape the fatality which induced

the Lairds of Ellangowan to interfere with politics, he had yet the

prudence, ere he went out with Lord Kenmore in 1715, to convey his estate

to trustees, in order to parry pains and penalties in case the Earl of Mar

could not put down the Protestant succession. But Scylla and Charybdis--a

word to the wise--he only saved his estate at expense of a lawsuit, which

again subdivided the family property. He was, however, a man of

resolution. He sold part of the lands, evacuated the old cattle, where the

family lived in their decadence as a mouse (said an old farmer) lives

under a firlot. Pulling down part of these venerable ruins, he built with

the stones a narrow house of three stories high, with a front like a

grenadier’s cap, having in the very centre a round window like the single

eye of a Cyclops, two windows on each side, and a door in the middle,

leading to a parlour and withdrawing-room full of all manner of cross

lights.

This was the New Place of Ellangowan, in which we left our hero, better

amused perhaps than our readers, and to this Lewis Bertram retreated, full

of projects for re-establishing the prosperity of his family. He took some

land into his own hand, rented some from neighbouring proprietors, bought

and sold Highland cattle and Cheviot sheep, rode to fairs and trysts,

fought hard bargains, and held necessity at the staff’s end as well as he

might. But what he gained in purse he lost in honour, for such

agricultural and commercial negotiations were very ill looked upon by his

brother lairds, who minded nothing but cock-fighting, hunting, coursing,

and horse-racing, with now and then the alternative of a desperate duel.

The occupations which he followed encroached, in their opinion, upon the

article of Ellangowan’s gentry, and he found it necessary gradually to

estrange himself from their society, and sink into what was then a very

ambiguous character, a gentleman farmer. In the midst of his schemes death

claimed his tribute, and the scanty remains of a large property descended

upon Godfrey Bertram, the present possessor, his only son.

The danger of the father’s speculations was soon seen. Deprived of Laird

Lewis’s personal and active superintendence, all his undertakings

miscarried, and became either abortive or perilous. Without a single spark

of energy to meet or repel these misfortunes, Godfrey put his faith in the

activity of another. He kept neither hunters nor hounds, nor any other

southern preliminaries to ruin; but, as has been observed of his

countrymen, he kept a man of business, who answered the purpose equally

well. Under this gentleman’s supervision small debts grew into large,

interests were accumulated upon capitals, movable bonds became heritable,

and law charges were heaped upon all; though Ellangowan possessed so

little the spirit of a litigant that he was on two occasions charged to

make payment of the expenses of a long lawsuit, although he had never

before heard that he had such cases in court. Meanwhile his neighbours

predicted his final ruin. Those of the higher rank, with some malignity,

accounted him already a degraded brother. The lower classes, seeing

nothing enviable in his situation, marked his embarrassments with more

compassion. He was even a kind of favourite with them, and upon the

division of a common, or the holding of a black-fishing or poaching court,

or any similar occasion when they conceived themselves oppressed by the

gentry, they were in the habit of saying to each other, ‘Ah, if

Ellangowan, honest man, had his ain that his forbears had afore him, he

wadna see the puir folk trodden down this gait.’ Meanwhile, this general

good opinion never prevented their taking advantage of him on all possible

occasions, turning their cattle into his parks, stealing his wood,

shooting his game, and so forth, ‘for the Laird, honest man, he’ll never

find it; he never minds what a puir body does.’ Pedlars, gipsies, tinkers,

vagrants of all descriptions, roosted about his outhouses, or harboured in

his kitchen; and the Laird, who was ‘nae nice body,’ but a thorough

gossip, like most weak men, found recompense for his hospitality in the

pleasure of questioning them on the news of the country side.

A circumstance arrested Ellangowan’s progress on the highroad to ruin.

This was his marriage with a lady who had a portion of about four thousand

pounds. Nobody in the neighbourhood could conceive why she married him and

endowed him with her wealth, unless because he had a tall, handsome

figure, a good set of features, a genteel address, and the most perfect

good-humour. It might be some additional consideration, that she was

herself at the reflecting age of twenty-eight, and had no near relations

to control her actions or choice.

It was in this lady’s behalf (confined for the first time after her

marriage) that the speedy and active express, mentioned by the old dame of

the cottage, had been despatched to Kippletringan on the night of

Mannering’s arrival.

Though we have said so much of the Laird himself, it still remains that we

make the reader in some degree acquainted with his companion. This was

Abel Sampson, commonly called, from his occupation as a pedagogue, Dominie

Sampson. He was of low birth, but having evinced, even from his cradle, an

uncommon seriousness of disposition, the poor parents were encouraged to

hope that their bairn, as they expressed it, ‘might wag his pow in a

pulpit yet.’ With an ambitious view to such a consummation, they pinched

and pared, rose early and lay down late, ate dry bread and drank cold

water, to secure to Abel the means of learning. Meantime, his tall,

ungainly figure, his taciturn and grave manners, and some grotesque habits

of swinging his limbs and screwing his visage while reciting his task,

made poor Sampson the ridicule of all his school-companions. The same

qualities secured him at Glasgow College a plentiful share of the same

sort of notice. Half the youthful mob of ‘the yards’ used to assemble

regularly to see Dominie Sampson (for he had already attained that

honourable title) descend the stairs from the Greek class, with his

lexicon under his arm, his long misshapen legs sprawling abroad, and

keeping awkward time to the play of his immense shoulder-blades, as they

raised and depressed the loose and threadbare black coat which was his

constant and only wear. When he spoke, the efforts of the professor

(professor of divinity though he was) were totally inadequate to restrain

the inextinguishable laughter of the students, and sometimes even to

repress his own. The long, sallow visage, the goggle eyes, the huge

under-jaw, which appeared not to open and shut by an act of volition, but

to be dropped and hoisted up again by some complicated machinery within

the inner man, the harsh and dissonant voice, and the screech-owl notes to

which it was exalted when he was exhorted to pronounce more

distinctly,--all added fresh subject for mirth to the torn cloak and

shattered shoe, which have afforded legitimate subjects of raillery

against the poor scholar from Juvenal’s time downward. It was never known

that Sampson either exhibited irritability at this ill usage, or made the

least attempt to retort upon his tormentors. He slunk from college by the

most secret paths he could discover, and plunged himself into his

miserable lodging, where, for eighteenpence a week, he was allowed the

benefit of a straw mattress, and, if his landlady was in good humour,

permission to study his task by her fire. Under all these disadvantages,

he obtained a competent knowledge of Greek and Latin, and some

acquaintance with the sciences.
