JEWISH OR ANCIENT CHRISTIANITY.

It is our purpose to present the evidences showing

that a system of Astral worship, which we designate as

Jewish Christianity, was in existence more than two

centuries and a half before the institution of its

modern form. In verification of this assertion we must

find the initial point of our inquiry in ancient history,

which teaches that in the division of the Grecian Empire

among his generals, after the death of Alexander the

Great, who died 332 years before the beginning of our era,

the governorship of Egypt and adjacent provinces was secured

by Ptolemy Lagus, or Soter, who, having subsequently

suppressed a revolt in Judea, removed from that

country a large body of its inhabitants to people the new

city of Alexandria, which had been laid out by order of

and named after the great Conqueror.

The Egyptian version of the Gospel story, being

more appropriate to the Nile Valley than to the region

from whence they came, the Greek colonists of Alexandria

adopted it, but preferring to pay homage to Serapis,

one of the ninth incarnations of God Sol, which they

imported from Pontus, a Greek province of Asia Minor,

they erected to his worship that celebrated temple known

as the Grand Serapium; and, transferring the culture and

refinement of Greece to the new city, it became, under the

Ptolemian dynasty, a great seat of learning; the arts and

sciences flourished, an immense library was collected, the

various forms of Astral worship were represented and

schools for the dissemination of the several phases of Grecian

philosophy and Oriental Gnosticism were founded.

Such being the environment of the Jewish residents

of Alexandria, they soon acquired the vernacular and

adopted the religion of the Greeks, who, having ever attached

to their incarnate saviours the title signifying the

Christ, or the anointed, were known as Christians. Encouraged

by the liberal policy of Philadelphus, the second

Ptolemy, a body of their learned men, who had been educated

in the Greek schools, founded a college for the education

of their own people, which institution was ultimately

known as the University of Alexandria. Under

the auspices of Philadelphus the professors of that institution

rendered their Hebrew sacred records into the Greek

language, which translation is known as the Septuagint, or

Alexandrian version of the Old Testament.

Having acquired from the Egyptian astrologers the

arts of healing, thaumaturgy and necromancy, and teaching

them in their school, the professors of the Jewish

college of Alexandria assumed the title of Essenes, or

Therapeutae, the Egyptian and Greek words signifying

Doctors, Healers or Wonder Workers. Possessed of the

sad and gloomy characteristics of their race, they adopted

the "Contemplative Life," or asceticism of the Oriental

Gnosticism, from which they derived the name of Ascetics.

Founding a church for the propagation of their

peculiar tenets, those who were set apart for the ministry

assumed the title of Ecclesiastics. Inculcating rigid temperance

and self-denial among their people, they were

known as Enchratites, Nazarites or Abstainers; and the

more devout among them retiring to monasteries, or to

the solitude of caves and other secluded places, were also

designated as Monks, Cenobites, Friars, Eremites, Hermits

or Solitaries.

The time having arrived, according to the cyclic

teachings of Astral worship, for the manifestation of the

tenth and last incarnation of God Sol, or, in other words,

to, give a new name to the mythical genius of the sun, the

professors of the Jewish school of Alexandria is resolved to

inaugurate their own form of worship. While retaining the

same title under which they had paid homage to Serapis

and known as Christians, Essenes or Therapeutae, they

substituted for their Christ the name of the Grecian Bacchus,

which, composed of the letters ΙΗΣ, signifies Yes,

Ies or Jes. In composing their version of the Gospel

story, having, like their race, no inventive genius, they appropriated

that of Serapis as its basis and laid its scene in

the land of their ancestry, but inconsistently retained the

sign of the cross and the phraseology connected there

with, which, having special reference to the Nile River and

its annual inundation, had no application whatever to the

sterile land of Judea. Selecting what they conceived to

be the best from other versions of the Gospel story, and assuming

the title of Eclectics, they designated their system

as the Eclectic Philosophy. In proof of the eclectic character

of the Gospel and Epistles of ancient Christianity, we

refer to the Asceticism inculcated therein, which, derived

from the Oriental Gnosticism, we find perpetuated in the

scriptures of modern Christianity; we also refer to the miracle

of converting water into wine, taken from the Gospel

story of Bacchus, and to the statements that the Saviour

was the son of a carpenter and was hung between two

thieves, copied from the story of Christna, the Eighth,

Avatar of the East Indian astrolatry. Thus we see that,

although the scene of the Gospel story of ancient Christianity

was laid in the land of Judea, its authors having

adopted a Greek version of that story as its basis, given a

Greek title and name to their Messiah, perpetuated a

Greek name for their sect and quoted exclusively from the

Septuagint, or Greek version of the Old Testament, the

facts show conclusively that it was not Jews of Judea, but

Hellenized Jews of Alexandria, who were the real authors

of the ancient Christianity.
