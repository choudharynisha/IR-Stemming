There is in India a well-known iconographie tradition of the
deities,1 at first eight in number (excluding Ketu), and later
navagrahas). Several Puränas2 and various texts on silpasästra
these images in detail, and a number of early examples surv
are the images ordinarily worshipped and propitiated by th
who believe in the reality of astrological influences.
 There is also a separate tradition regarding the image of S
Sun god, introduced by the Zoroastrian Magi5 and Kusänas w

But it is clear that similar descriptions were transmitted by a second
translation from the Greek which was utilized in the now lost astrological
poem of Satya (second or third century); Satya's verses are reflected in
the Vrddhayavanajâtaka11 of Mînarâja (fourth century), and in the
Laghujätaka12 and Brhajjâtaka13 of Varähamihira (sixth century). But
Varähamihira has also used the Yavanajâtaka, as has pseudo-Prthuyasas,
who claims to be Varähamihira's son, in the Horâsâra.1* Pseudo
Paräsara (seventh or eighth century) has copied from the Brhajjâtaka in
the Pürvakhanda of his Brhatpäräsarahoräsästra,15 while Kalyänavarman
(c. A.D. 800) has used both the Yavanajâtaka and the Brhajjâtaka in the
relevant verses of the Särävali,16 An anonymous author cited by Sivaräja
(fifteenth century) in his Jyotirnibandha17 and Mantresvara (sixteenth
century) in the Phaladîpikâ18 rely on Kalyänavarman, while Gunäkara
(fourteenth century?) in his Horâmakaranda19 depends on both the
Brhajjâtaka and the Sârâvalï. Less important characterizations of the
planets can be found in the Täjika20 of Nilakantha (who finished the
Varsatantra in 1587) and the Jâtakâbharana21 of Dhundhiräja (who wrote
in 1628).
  The most obvious dissimilarity between Sphujidhvaja s verses and
those of the later Indian astrologers lies in the order of the planets.
By the fourth century in India it had become an unbreakable rule that
the planets must be named in the order of their lordships of the week
days: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Sphujidh
vaja was early enough to escape this law, and here arranges the planets

356 A.H. or A.D. 966/967),28 'Ali ibn ab! 'r-Rijäl (died after 432 A.H. or
A.D. 1040/1041),29 and an unknown Byzantine author.30
     Related to this Dorothean tradition are passages in Ptolemy's (second
century) Tetrabiblos on the influence of the five star-planets on the bodies31
and souls32 of natives and in Firmicus Maternus' (fl. 334-337) Ma thesis.'M
Both of these, however, contain additions to Dorotheus' text, some of
which are paralleled in the Yavanajätaka. Some of these additions are
also found attributed to Pythagoras in some Greek manuscripts,34 and
in others they are incorporated in a longer treatise which pretends to be
derived from an Egyptian source.35 This "Pythagorean" or "Egyptian"
text was combined with Hephaestio's quotations from Dorotheus by
Rhetorius of Egypt (early sixth century).36 Outside of both these tradi
tions, but to some extent similar to the "Pythagorean", are two short
documents, one ascribed to an unknown Anatolius,37 the other tentatively
(and undoubtedly wrongly) to Heliodorus.38
     Finally, one must mention the planetary iconography in the temples of
the "Säbians" of Harrän known from several descriptions in Arabic
sources,39 as it was thought by Saxl to preserve an ancient Babylonian
tradition.40 With this can also be compared the descriptions of the
planetary images of the "Sipasians" in the Dabistàn of Moshan FänI.41

century A.D.), which was one of the sources of Vettius Valens (1,1) and of the chapter
of Rhetorius cited above. This, however, is concerned almost exclusively with the
natives' activities and occupations, not their appearances or characters. Similar to
Teucer's text is that ascribed to Abu Ma'shar (787-886) in Greek manuscripts (CCAG,
11, 1; 178-184).

Hellenistic characterizations of the natives born under the influences of
the planets are in part borrowings from Babylonian astrology, but we are
not yet in a position to determine the extent of this influence. Surely
many particulars of the images supposedly erected by the "Säbians" and
"Sipasians" and those described elsewhere in Islamic sources are derived
from the Indian tradition investigated in this paper.
  In the following pages I give the more important Sanskrit texts and
translations thereof. The words underlined with a solid line in the
Vrddhayavanajdtaka, Brhajjdtaka, Laghujätaka, and Särävali correspond
to words in the Yavanajdtaka; those italicized represent ideas similar to
those in the Yavanajdtaka. In an appendix I list the parallels to the adjec
tives of Sphujidhvaja and Satya which I have found in the Hellenistic
characterizations of the natives born under the influence of each planet.
The planetary melothesia and dosas which appear in these texts will be
discussed in detail in my edition of the Yavanajdtaka.
