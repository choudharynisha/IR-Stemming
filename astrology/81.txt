          Summary.-Astrology, as presently practiced (in either its tradiuonal or psycho-
    logical form), has no relevance to understanding ourselves or our place in the cosmos.
    Modern advocates of astrology cannot account for the underlying basis of astrological
    associations with terrestrial affairs, have no plausible explanation for its claims, and
    have not contributed anything of cognitive value to any field of the social sciences.
    Further, astrology does not have the theoretical or conceptual resources to resolve its
    own internal problems adequately or external anomalies or to adjudicate among con-
    flicting astrological claims or systems.

The initial assumptions of scientists and astrologers were not so very different until quite re-
cently. Some astrologers, however, fearing that science was catching up to them, have back-
tracked very rapidly, c r e a h g a smokescreen of symbolism, inner reality, holistic understanding,
etc.
                                                                     Arthur Mather (1979, p. 106)

      In Western culture until Newton the views of astrologers and scientists
were not so very different. There was general belief that -all phenomena in
the inferior elemental world of nature were governed in some way by the
motions of the superior and incorruptible celestial bodies. Since Newton,
however, the views of astrologers and scientists have become increasingly
opposed. Astrologers today stdl hold that the connection between celestial
and earthly phenomena is so strong that knowing one allows us to predict
the other. But scientists disagree. They point out that there is no plausible
way the connection could work, or even a plausible theory of how it could
work. Surveys of research into astrology have provided no evidence that
astrology does work, at least not in the way and to the extent claimed by
astrologers. Of course, every time we wake up with the sun, or plan barbe-
cues on m o o d t nights, or go fishing at high tide, we are showing how celes-
tial bodies have real influence in our lives; but this IS very different from the
connection clamed by astrologers. Going from one co the other is a quite
unjusufied leap of faith.

ogy today do not even attempt to defend it but simply teach their readers
how to use it" (p. 39). Similarly, Nias and Dean (1986) pointed out, "no-
body should be surprised to learn that the hardest things to find in astrology
are facts" (p. 357). But if you know where to look they can certainly be
found.
     Before 1950 very few scientific studies of astrology existed. Something
h e a dozen major statistical compilations by astrologers had appeared since
1900, notably in France, Germany, England and the USA, but none were
widely known, and in any case their methodology was too poor, e.g., no
controls, for meaningful results. Not surprisingly, the few published critiques
were confined mostly to historical surveys (e.g., Thomen, 1938; Bok &
Mayall, 1941; Eisler, 1946). The only extensive scientific critique available
was by the French astronomer Paul Couderc (1951/1974). Then in 1955
Michel G a u q u e h published his landmark L'lnfluence des Astres, the first
rigorous study of astrological claims, with generally negative results but with
what seemed to be provocative exceptions (Gauqueh, 1955).
     During the next two decades various factors combined to establish a
small but continuing interest in astrological research, namely, the booming
popular interest in astrology, further work by Gauquelin (e.g., 1966, 1969),
the occasional astrology-related paper in a scientific journal, and not least by
astrologers themselves founding research-oriented bodles such as the Astro-
logical Association (UK) in 1958 and the International Society for Astrologi-
cal Research (USA) in 1970. The result was a notable increase in the number
of critical studies.
      Ln the 1970s there appeared various critiques of the occult that in-
cluded astrology (e.g., Freedland, 1972; Cooper, 1974; Sladek, 1974; Cazeau
& Scott, 1979) and critiques devoted entirely to astrology (e.g., Parker, 1970;
Russell, 1972; Gallant, 1974; Dean & Mather, 1977; Jerome, 1977; Standen,
1977; Kelly, 1979). The last was the first comprehensive critical review of as-
trology's scientific research base. It took seven person-years to prepare, sur-
veyed many hundreds of books and articles, and documented over 150 em-
pirical stucbes published in astrology journals and over twenty published in
psychology journals (Dean & Mather, 1977). By 1996, new studles and pre-
viously missed studies had brought these totals to about 300 and 70, respec-
tively (Dean, Nias, & French, 1997).
      The research interest that Dean and Mather (1977) stimulated led to
the foundation in 1981 of Correlation, an international peer-reviewed journal
devoted entirely to scientific research into astrology, followed in 1982 by
Astro-Psychological Problems, oriented more toward Gauquelin interests. By
then the advent of home computers in the late 1970s had revolutionized
astrological practice and research. Calculating a birth chart once took any-
where from an hour to a day; now it could be done in seconds, allowing

researchers to do studies that were previously unthinkable. Today there is a
scholarly research base that covers most of the basic claims of astrology.
Even sun slgn columns have been tested. The outcome from all this, in what
probably amounts to well over two hundred person-years of research, is al-
most uniformly negative (Dean, Mather, & Kelly, 1996). Unfortunately, much
of this work is neither widely known nor easily accessible, a point to which I
will return shortly.
      Critical reviews of astrology in the light of research findings, post-1980,
include those by psychologists Eysenck and Nias (1982), astronomers Culver
and Ianna (1988), Crowe (1990), Martens and Trachet (1995), and the Bible
scholars, Ankerberg and Weldon (1989). The most recent reviews and the
first to include meta-analyses are by Kelly, Dean, and Saklofske (1990) and
Dean, Mather, and Kelly (1996). Critiques of philosophical, rehgious or so-
cial aspects of astrology include Kelly and Krutzen (19831, Leahey and
Leahey (1983), Kanitscheider (1991), Dean (1992), and Dean and Loptson
(1996). Reviews of the arguments of astrologers include Kelly, Culver, and
Loptson (1989), and Dean, Mather, and Kelly (1996). Theories of astrology
(including Jung's synchronicity) are critically examined in Dean, Loptson,
and Kelly (1996). Descriptions of the Gauquelin work include Gauquelin
(1983, 1988) and Ertel (1992). The 'Mars effect' is specifically addressed by
Benski, Caudron. Gahfret, Krivine, Pecker, Rouze, and Schatzman (19961,
whose conclusions have been dsputed by Ertel and Inlmg (1996). The cog-
nitive and perceptual biases that can underlie belief in astrology are briefly
reviewed by Dean (1992) and in detail by Dean, Kelly, Saklofske, and Furn-
ham (1992), and Dean, Mather, and Kelly (1996). Recent critiques of the
occult that cover astrology include Couttie (19881, Hmes (19881, and Neher
(1990). There is, of course, an extensive and ongoing literature on the his-
tory of astrology, for example, ancient astrology (Baigent, 1994; Barton,
1994; Stewart, 1996), medieval psychology (Kemp, 19901, pre- 19' century
astrology (Tester, 1987), and 19' century astrology (Curry, 1992).
      Why the present article? Since the mid-1970s psychology journals have
averaged a steady total per year of about two empirical studies of astrologi-
cal claims, plus an equal number devoted to related topics such as the accep-
tance of astrological statements or the prevalence of belief in astrology, all of
them easily accessible via PsycLIT, the American Psychological Association's
computerized abstract database. But for every such empirical study there are
at least four more of equal qu&ty in journals not accessible via PsycLIT.
Fortunately, most of the major reviews listed above cover this wider informa-
tion base. On the other hand, the reviews are generally more focussed on
empirical findtngs than with paradigms and conceptual arguments. The pres-
ent article focuses on the latter and brings together previously scattered ma-
terial.
