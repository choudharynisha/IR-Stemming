CHAPTER IX.

OF THE INFLUENCES OF THE FIXED STARS

The fixed stars are so called because they appear to keep at the same

distance from one another in the heavens. All of these stars have their

respective influences analogous to those of the planets. The following

table of the principal fixed stars, with their several magnitudes and

natures, will be found useful. It is only those of the first and second

magnitude which much affect us; the influence of those stars marked as

of fourth magnitude is very slight. The time of the rising and setting

of the fixed stars varies according to the latitudes of the places of

observation. Their longitudes increase at the annual rate of 50

seconds, but their latitudes vary very little. The right ascension and

declinations of the numerous fixed stars are given every year in the

Nautical Almanack.

To know when any of these fixed stars will affect the horoscope we must

note the sign and degree on the cusps of the houses, and if (on

consulting the Ephemeris) any of these stars should be found to be

ascending or descending within five degrees of the signs upon the cusps

of the several houses, they must be entered in the same manner as the

planets, and their qualities weighed according to the nature of the

planet or planets with which they correspond, as shown by the table

given.
